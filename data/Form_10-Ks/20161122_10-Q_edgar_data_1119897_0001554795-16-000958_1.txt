NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUTNTING POLICIES 

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of Bingham Canyon Corporation ( the Company ) have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and reflect all
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our balance sheet, statements of operations,
and cash flows for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations
for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.   

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial statements as reported
in its Form 10-K and 8-K, filed September 2, 2016. 

Nature of Operations  

 On August 31, 2016, the Company entered into
a Securities Exchange Agreement with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation ( Paradigm ) to effect the acquisition
of Paradigm as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 16,790,625 restricted common shares
of Company stock to all of the shareholders of Paradigm in exchange for all 22,387,500 outstanding Paradigm common stock. In addition,
the Company issued options exercisable into 2,040,000 shares of the Company s common stock (with exercise prices ranging
between $0.133 and $0.333) in exchange for 2,720,000 outstanding Paradigm stock options (with exercise prices ranging between $0.10
and $0.25). Lastly, the Company assumed an obligation to issue up to 750,000 Company common shares pursuant to a Paradigm distribution
agreement. These 2,790,000 shares have been adjusted at the same exchange rate of .75 that the outstanding common shares were exchanged
at (See also Notes 7 and 9). As a result of this reverse recapitalization, Paradigm, the operating company, is considered the accounting
acquirer. 

Paradigm is located in Lenexa, Kansas and was
formed June 6, 2012 under the name of EUR-ECA, Ltd. The Company is a technology licensing company specializing in environmentally
safe solutions for global sustainability. The company holds patent, intellectual property and/or distribution rights to innovative
products and technologies. Paradigm s overall strategy is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment
leasing, joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements and partnerships. 

Principles of Consolidations  

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Bingham Canyon Corporation ( Parent ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Paradigm Convergence
Technologies Corporation ( Paradigm  or  Subsidiary ). All intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon
consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of the condensed consolidated
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other market-specific and other relevant
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 Cash and cash equivalents are considered to
be cash and a highly liquid security with original maturities of three months or less. There were no cash equivalents as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Accounts Receivable  

 Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated
collectible amounts. The Company provided allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable equal to the estimated collection losses
that will be incurred in collection of all receivables. Accounts receivable is periodically evaluated for collectability bases
on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. That Company s management determines which accounts
are past due and if deemed uncollectible, the Company charges off the receivable in the period the determination is made. Based
on management s evaluation, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Inventory  

 The inventory is consists of raw materials
(totaling $46,995 at September 30, 2016) and finished goods (totaling $35,914 at September 30, 2016) are valued based upon first-in
first-out ( FIFO ) cost, not in excess of market. There was no obsolete inventory at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. 

Fair Value Measurements  

 The Company follows
ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   which defines fair value as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure
fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy based
on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable, is used to
measure fair value: 

Level 1: 
     Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2: 
     Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3: 
     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.  

The carrying values
of our financial instruments, including, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. We do not
have other financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. 

Valuation of Long-lived Assets  

 The carrying values of the Company s
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not
be recoverable. When projections indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, the carrying value
is reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected undiscounted cash flows. Under similar analysis no
impairment was recorded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis and,
should they indicate a carrying value in excess of fair value, additional impairment changes may be required. 

Property and Equipment  

 Property and equipment are stated at purchased
cost and depreciated on a straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. Upon disposition of property
and equipment, related gains and losses are recorded in the results of operations. Accumulated depreciation for period ending September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $26,515 and $15,853, respectively. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend
the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses as
incurred. 

Intangible Assets  

 Intangible assets are costs to obtain or develop
patents. These costs are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. The assets are being amortized over their estimated useful
lives on the straight line method ranging from 5 to 15 years. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount is not
recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets as determined by the projected undiscounted
net future cash flows. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $88,712 and $83,690, respectively. 

Research and Development  

 Research and development costs are recognized
as an expense during the period incurred, which is until the conceptual formulation, design, and testing of the process is completed
and the process has been determined to be commercially viable. 

Revenue Recognition  

 Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, services have been provided or goods delivered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time of shipment to the customers. Revenue from contracts
to license technology to others is immediately recognized since it is a non-refundable deposit. 

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share  

 Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for computing basic EPS as of September 30, 2016 was 18,473,821. There were
1,467,250 common stock equivalents from stock options that were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,
 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  ASU 2015-03 was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance
costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. This makes the presentation
of debt issuance costs consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. Under prior U.S. GAAP, debt issuance costs
were reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense. Under ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs will continue
to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. 

The Company has reviewed all other FASB issued
ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates during the period reported and in future periods.
The company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous GAAP and do not believe that any new or modified
principles will have a material impact on the company s reported financial position or operations in the near term. 

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets,
has incurred losses since inception of $2,437,226, and has negative cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had a working capital deficit of $641,685. The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing
day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

NOTE 3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

Property and Equipment consist of the following
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

NOTE 4. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The components of intangible assets at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were as follows: 

NOTE 5. DEBT 

At September 30, 2016 the Company had outstanding
notes payable   related party of $455,000 (see Note 6) and notes payable totaling $321,477, of which $204,527 is long-term. 

Notes Payable  

 On May 18, 2016, the Company entered into a
loan agreement for $150,000 with an unrelated individual. The note is due on June 1, 2018. The note is secured by a mortgage or
deed of trust on a property located in Fuquay Varina, North Carolina, owned by a minority shareholder, and by a personal guarantee
of the President of the Company. The note bears an interest rate of 13% per annum and a default rate of 19% per annum. The Company
paid an origination fee of 10% of the loan value and a broker s commission of 3% of the loan value. There was also appraisal,
underwriting, loan service, and attorney fees of approximately $9,500. The Company recorded a debt discount of approximately $29,079
resulting from these issuance costs which is being amortized over the life of the loan, leaving a discount balance of $23,973 at
September 30, 2016.  

On March 11, 2016 the Company entered into
a promissory note with an entity controlled by a Company shareholder for $7,500 to be used in operations. The note was due on September
11, 2016, is unsecured and bears an interest rate of 5% per annum. The note is in default. There is no change in interest rate
but it is due on demand. 

During 2012 and 2013 the Parent Company entered
into three notes payable from a third party in the amount of $187,950 with annual interest rate of 8%. The notes are unsecured.
The origination dates range from December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2013. The maturity dates on the three loans range from
 on demand  to July 1, 2018. Accrued interest at September 30, 2016 totaled $58,062. 

Convertible Notes Payable  

 In March 2015, the Company entered into two
promissory notes for $25,000 each with two nonrelated parties. Both notes bear interest at 6% per annum, are unsecured and were
due on September 24, 2015. Both loans were paid down by $12,500 each in August 2015. In November 2015 both lenders agreed to execute
a debt conversion agreement loaning back the $12,500 that had been repaid. The debt conversion agreement is for one year with 6% 

 interest per annum and allows them to convert
the debt to one share of stock and a warrant ( Unit ) at a $.10 exercise price for up to six months, at $.40 per common
share from six months to nine months and at $1.00 per common share from nine months to one year. The warrant gives the holder the
right to purchase a common share at $1.00 per common share over a three year period. This resulted in a beneficial conversion feature
discount of $1,615 of which $1,615 was amortized through June 30, 2016 as the convertible debt was fully converted and settled. 

On April 4, 2016, the holders of the convertible
debentures elected to convert the full principal balance of $25,000 into 250,000 shares each at $0.10 per common share. In addition,
the note holders received an additional 250,000 shares each in settlement of the remaining accrued interest and warrants. 

NOTE 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company entered into fourteen promissory notes with the Company President for proceeds of $381,500. In addition, during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had $10,000 in expenses paid on the Company s behalf by the President.
The notes are due in 12 months from their issuance dates (between February 2017 and September 2017) are unsecured and bear and
interest at 5% per annum. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 $52,500 was paid back to the President leaving a balance
of $439,000 at September 30, 2016. 

On January 1, 2016, the Company renewed the
employment agreement for the President of the Company. The term of agreement is for two years. The President will be paid $2,000
per month for the term of the agreement. 

From February 2015 to November 2015, the Company
entered into 12 promissory notes with the Company President for proceeds of $307,000. These notes are due in 12 months from their
issuance dates are unsecured and bear an interest rate of 5% per annum. During 2015, $200,000 of the amount due was exchanged for
2,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.10 per share 

On June 11, 2015, the Company entered into
a Promissory Note with shareholder for $5,000. The terms of the note include a maturity date on month from the origination date
and no interest. The Company repaid this note before year end, leaving no balance outstanding on the Promissory Note at December
31, 2015. 

On November 25 and December 10, 2015 the Company
entered into two additional Promissory Notes with a shareholder for $5,000 and $25,000, respectively. The terms of both notes include

On September 15, 2016 the Company issued 10,000
stock options related to a consulting agreement. The options vest 2,500 per month for each month the consultant is doing work for
the Company for a 4 month period. The Company used the Black-Scholes methodology to value the stock-based compensation expense
for options. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company recognized $0 in compensation expense, leaving approximately $13,695 in compensation expense to be recognized over the
remaining vesting period through December 31, 2016. 

In applying the Black-Scholes methodology to
the 175,000 options granted during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of our stock-based awards was
estimated using the following assumptions ranging from: 

Below is a table summarizing the options issued and outstanding
as of September 30, 2016: 

The weighted average exercise prices are $0.154 and $0.133 for the
options outstanding and exercisable, respectively.

NOTE 9. DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER AGREEMENTS 

In August 2012, Paradigm entered into a distribution
agreement with an Italian limited liability company, which granted Paradigm an exclusive license to commercialize the licensed
technology in all current and future potentials of use throughout the United States and Canada. The current technology included
equipment and intellectual property that is capable of making  Anolyte . The agreement called for Paradigm to issue 2,500,000
shares of common stock at a par value of $.001 per share and to pay a royalty of $.25 per gallon of Anolyte sold. The 2,500,000
shares were never issued to Paradigm because of the anticipated amendment to the agreement. The agreement was amended in June 2014
to remove the exclusivity to the United States and Canada. The terms of the amended agreement call for the issuance of up to 1,000,000
shares of common stock at a par value of $.001 per share at the discretion of Paradigm s President. It also requires Paradigm
to purchase up to $150,000 of LLC s equipment by year two and up to $300,000 of equipment by year three. Through September
30, 2016, Paradigm has purchased $224,846 worth of equipment. To date none of the potential 1,000,000 shares of common stock have
been issued to Paradigm. On September 14, 2015 a deposit of $10,000 was paid for additional equipment. This equipment has not been
received as of September 30, 2016. 

On July 5, 2015 Paradigm amended its Distributor
Agreement which provides for an issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The shares will be issued at the discretion
of Paradigm s President based upon improvement to the technology of the equipment and EPA registration approval of the fluids
produced by the equipment. To date, none of the 1,000,000 shares of common stock has been issued. The term of the Agreement is
from July 15, 2015 to July 15, 2020. According to the share exchange agreement, the Parent assumed an obligation to issue up to
750,000 Company common shares pursuant to a Paradigm distribution agreement. Through September 30, 2016 nothing has transpired
and no operations have commenced. 

In January of 2016 Paradigm entered into a
 Memorandum of Understanding  with a third party to enter into a business relationship to develop, promote and sell
the citrus applications for Anolyte and Catholyte. The terms of the agreement are such that Paradigm intends to share in 10% of
the resulting profits and to aid in management and administration. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 nothing has
transpired and no operations have commenced.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Executive Overview   

On August 10, 2016, Bingham entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement
(the  Exchange Agreement ) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation ( Paradigm ).
Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Paradigm became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingham after the exchange transaction.
Bingham is a holding company, which through Paradigm is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through
licensing and joint ventures. 

We are a technology development and licensing company specializing
in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. We hold patent, intellectual property and/or distribution rights to
innovative products and technologies. Our overall strategy is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment
leasing, joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements and partnerships. Generally, it is not our intent to be the primary
producer and distributor of the technology products: but rather to license the underlying technology while developing new opportunities
and applications for the products and promoting the brands. We intend to also continue our constant pursuit of new technologies
(through acquisition or invention) upon which we can build and expand our joint venture and licensing core business. However, Paradigm
may not be able to identify suitable license or joint venture opportunities, nor guarantee that any such agreements will be profitable. 

Bingham had not recorded revenues for the two fiscal years prior
to its acquisition of Paradigm and was dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Paradigm has recorded revenue since
it initiated operations in 2012; however, those revenues have not been sufficient to finance operations, recording annual net losses
through December 31, 2015 and for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Accordingly the Company recorded a net loss of
$663,895 at September 30, 2016. 

Bingham remains dependent upon additional financing to continue
operations. The Company intends to raise additional equity financing through private placements of its common stock. We expect
that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities
laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs, as discussed below, and the available
exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common
stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock. 

The ex pected
costs for the next twelve months include:  

a major commercial launch of non-toxic sanitizing, disinfecting
and sterilizing products and technologies with a strong emphasis on health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes,
assisted living facilities, clinics and medical, dental and veterinarian offices;  

continued research and development on product generation
units including those designed for on-site deployment at customers  facilities;  

accelerated research and development on applications
of the products in the agricultural sector, most specifically with respect to abatement of Citrus Greening Disease crisis caused
by the HBL (Huanglongbing) bacterium in the U.S. and elsewhere;  

acquiring available complementary technology rights;  

payment of short-term debt;  

hiring of additional personnel in the fourth quarter
2016; and,  

general and administrative operating costs.  

Management projects
these cost to total approximately $1,300, 000. To minimize these costs, the Company intends to maintain its practice of
controlling operating overheads with efficient facilities commitments, generally below market salaries and consulting fees, and
rigorous prioritization of expenditure requirements. 

Based on its understanding of the commercial readiness of its products
and technologies, the capabilities of its personnel (current and being hired), established business relationships and the general
market conditions; management believes that the Company expects to be at or close to profitability by the second quarter of 2017. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $663,895
and a working capital deficit of $641,685. We have recorded a relatively small amount of revenues from operations since inception
and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During 2016 and 2015 we have
primarily relied upon advances and loans from a stockholder and third parties to fund our operations. The Company has relied on
raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. As September 30,
2016 we had $58,246 in cash compared to $42,486 in cash at December 31, 2015. We had total liabilities of $1,004,573 at September
30, 2016 compared to $232,396 at December 31, 2015. 

Our current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses
of approximately $73,000 and to fund future research and development. We intend to rely on additional debt financing, loans from
existing shareholders and private placements of common stock for additional funding; however, there is no assurance that additional
funding will be available. We do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures. However, we cannot assure you that
it will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be available, and if
available, that they will be on favorable terms. 

The increase in total liabilities primarily represents advances
and loans of approximately $582,228 net of debt discount of approximately $23,973, accrued interest of approximately $18,733, along
with accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $66,000 related to administrative and professional services and
out-of-pocket costs provided to or paid on behalf of the company by a stockholder during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Additional liabilities assumed as part of the reverse acquisition account for approximately $276,690. 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs
related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management,
significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert
debt or pay for expenses. 

Commitments and Obligations   

At September 30, 2016 the Company recorded notes payable totaling
approximately $776,477 compared to notes payable totaling $178,566 at December 31, 2015. These notes payable represent services
received, as well as cash advances received from third parties and a stockholder. Notes assumed as part of the reverse acquisition
accounted for approximately $187,950. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest from 5% to 8% and are due
on demand. 

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, Paradigm
entered into fourteen short-term promissory notes with the company President, Gary J. Grieco, totaling $381,500. In addition, during
this period Mr. Grieco paid $10,000 of expenses on behalf of the Company. The notes are each due twelve months from their issuance
dates (between February, 2017 and September, 2017) are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid back $52,500 of the loans to Mr. Grieco. The outstanding loan balance of all promissory
notes issued to Mr. Grieco was $439,000 at September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Paradigm paid back
$14,000 to a related entity controlled by a company shareholder on two promissory notes. $5,000 of this amount paid one of the
promissory notes in full. The remaining balance on the other note due to this entity is $16,000 and bears interest at the rate
of 5% per annum. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Paradigm entered
into a short term promissory note with an unrelated party controlled by a company shareholder in the amount of $7,500. The note
is for a period of nine months, is unsecured, and bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Paradigm entered
into a loan agreement with an unrelated individual in the amount of $150,000. The note is due June 1, 2018. The note is secured
by a mortgage or deed of trust on a property located in North Carolina and by a personal guarantee of the President of the company.
The note bears interest at the rate of 13% per annum. The company paid an origination fee of 10%, a broker s commission of
3% of the loan amount, and other closing fees of approximately $9,500. 

Paradigm has also entered into two leases for office space: one
is located in Lenexa, Kansas and the second in Little River, South Carolina. The office space lease amounts total $3,000 per month
and the Kansas lease includes an option to renew for two additional one year periods. 

Results of Operations   

Revenues increased to $4,750 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 (the  2016 third quarter ) compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (the  2015 third
quarter ). Revenues increased to $83,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $80 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The revenue increases for both periods were due to the increased volume of fluids sold and the sale of
a piece of fluid producing equipment. 

Cost of sales increased to $7,183 for the 2016 third quarter compared
to $0 for the 2015 third quarter. Cost of sales increased to $37,789 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0

Total operating expenses increased to $202,267 for the 2016 third
quarter compared to $117,943 for the 2015 third quarter. Total operating expenses increased to $623,724 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $313,998 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The total operating expense increases for
both periods were due to hiring three new employees and opening two new office locations. 

General and administrative expenses increased to $186,817 for the
2016 third quarter compared to $93,510 for the 2015 third quarter. General and administrative expenses increased to $517,711 for

third quarter compared to $4,200 for the 2015 third quarter. Research and development expenses increased to $90,330 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,848 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses
increased for both periods due to field testing required for EPA certification. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $2,124 for the
2016 third quarter compared to $20,233 for the 2015 third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $15,683
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $25,551 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Depreciation and
amortization expenses decreased for both periods due to the full amortization of plastic patent at September 30, 2015. 

Total interest expenses increased to $22,226 for the 2016 third
quarter compared to $4,096 for the 2015 third quarter. Total interest expenses increased to $37,321 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $4,952 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Increase interest expense associated with increased borrowings
for continued operations. The Company recorded a loss on convertible debt in the amount of $48,872 in the second quarter of 2016
this expense was associated with the election by two holders of convertible debentures to convert the debentures solely to common
stock. 

Net loss from operations and after income taxes increased to $226,926
for the 2016 third quarter compared to $122,039 for the 2015 third quarter. Net loss from operations and after income taxes increased

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Emerging Growth Company   - We qualify as an  emerging
growth company  under the recently enacted Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a
result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging
growth company, among other things, we will not be required to: 

Have
                                         an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section
                                         404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;    

Submit
                                         certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay 
                                         and  say-on-frequency     

Obtain
                                         shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and    

Disclose
                                         certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
                                         compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to
                                         median emplo yee compensation.   

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of
this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with
such new or revised accounting standards. 

We will remain an  emerging growth company  until the
earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the fifth
anniversary of our first sale of common equity pursuant to an effective registration statement; (iii) the date that we become a
 large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if
the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our
most recently completed third fiscal quarter; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible
debt during the preceding three-year period.
