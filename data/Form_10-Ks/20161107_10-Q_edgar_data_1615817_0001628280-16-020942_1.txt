  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  Note 1 - Organization, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Organization and Nature of Business 
  C J Energy Services Ltd. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  C J  or the  Company ) provides     well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America.  As one of the largest completion and production services companies in North America, C J offers a full, vertically integrated suite of services involved in the entire life cycle of the well, including hydraulic fracturing, cased-hole wireline, coiled tubing, cementing, rig services, fluids management services and other special well site services.  The Company provides its core services in all of the major oil and gas producing regions of the continental United States and Western Canada. 
  On March 24, 2015, C J Energy Services, Inc. ( Legacy C J ) and Nabors Industries Ltd. ( Nabors ) completed the combination of Legacy C J with Nabors  completion and production services business (the  C P Business ), whereby Legacy C J became a subsidiary of C J Energy Services Ltd. (the  Merger ).  The resulting combined company is currently led by the former management team of Legacy C J. 
  Upon the closing of the Merger, shares of common stock of Legacy C J were converted into common shares of C J on a 1-for-1 basis and C J's common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker  CJES.  C J is the successor issuer to Legacy C J following the closing of the Merger and is deemed to succeed to Legacy C J s reporting history under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  As discussed in more detail in Note 8   Mergers and Acquisitions, Legacy C J and Nabors determined that Legacy C J possessed the controlling financial interest in C J and subsequently concluded the business combination should be treated as a reverse acquisition with Legacy C J as the accounting acquirer. 
   On July 20, 2016, the Company filed voluntary petitions for reorganization seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.  The Company's Chapter 11 proceeding is being administered under the caption "  In re:  CJ Holding Co., et al., Case No. 16-33590  ."  Additionally, the Company commenced ancillary proceedings in Canada on behalf of its Canadian subsidiaries and a provisional liquidation proceeding in Bermuda on behalf of certain of its Bermudian subsidiaries. The Company is continuing operations and management of its assets in the ordinary course as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code and orders of the bankruptcy court.  See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding for additional information about the Company's Chapter 11 Proceeding. 
  As noted above, the Company was listed on the NYSE under the symbol "CJES" prior to the suspension of trading of its common shares on July 20, 2016, in connection with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The Company's common shares resumed trading on the OTC Markets Group Inc.'s OTC Pink under the symbol "CJESQ" on July 21, 2016. 
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  .  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been audited by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, except that the consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   and the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity as of   December 31, 2015  , are derived from audited consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for fair presentation have been included.  These consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company.  All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period financial statement classifications, including changes in accounting principle from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   which requires deferred financing costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of a debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  Because ASU 2015-03 was applied on a retrospective basis, deferred financing costs of $34.0 million related to the Company's Term Loan B facility have been reclassified to long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2015.  These reclassifications had no effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements.  Therefore, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  The operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.  
  As a result of the Merger, the Company revised its reportable segments late in the first quarter of 2015.  The Company s revised reportable segments are: (1) Completion Services, which includes the Company's hydraulic fracturing services, cased-hole wireline services, coiled tubing services and other stimulation services; (2) Well Support Services, which includes the Company's rig services, fluids management services, and other special well site services; and (3) Other Services, which includes the Company s smaller service lines and divisions, such as cementing services, equipment manufacturing and repair, and research and technology.  The Company manages several of its vertically integrated businesses through its research and technology division, including its directional drilling services and products, its data acquisition and control instruments provider and its artificial lift applications provider. 
  This segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by the Company s management, specifically its Chief Operating Decision Maker, to make decisions regarding the Company s business, including resource allocations and performance assessments.  This segment structure reflects the Company s current operating focus in compliance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") No. 280 - Segment Reporting.  See Note 7   Segment Information for further discussion regarding the Company s reportable segments. 
  The Company s results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   include results from the C P Business from the closing of the Merger on March 24, 2015 through   September 30, 2015  .  Results for periods prior to March 24, 2015 reflect the financial and operating results of Legacy C J, and do not include the financial and operating results of the C P Business.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms  C J  or the  Company , or like terms refer to Legacy C J and its subsidiaries when referring to time periods prior to March 24, 2015 and refer to C J and its subsidiaries (which include Legacy C J and its subsidiaries) when referring to time periods subsequent to March 24, 2015. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has applied the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 852 -   Reorganizations  , in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ASC 852 requires that the financial statements distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the Chapter 11 Proceeding from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain expenses, gains and losses that are realized or incurred in the Chapter 11 Proceeding will be recorded in a reorganization line item on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the Chapter 11 Proceeding will be classified on the balance sheet in liabilities subject to compromise. These liabilities will be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. 
  Going Concern  .  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern.  These principles assume that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations.  The Company incurred a net loss of $872.5 million during 2015 and   $825.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  During the first quarter of 2016, low utilization and commodity price levels continued to negatively impact the Company's results of operations which caused the Company to be unable to comply with the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant under the terms of the Credit Agreement measured as of March 31, 2016 (see Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Note 3 - Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for the meaning of all defined terms contained within this Going Concern section), which led to the Company's entry into the Restructuring Support Agreement with the Supporting Lenders and subsequent commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the implementation of a restructuring of the Company through a debt-to-equity conversion and Rights Offering, which transaction will be effectuated through the Restructuring Plan, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.  The Restructuring Plan is expected to significantly reduce the Company s indebtedness, including eliminating all amounts owed under the Credit Agreement, pursuant to a consensual debt-to-equity exchange.  At this time, there is no assurance the Company will be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully propose or implement the Restructuring Plan. 
  Given the circumstances leading to the Company's decision to seek relief under Chapter 11 and the impact on its business, including its liquidity and the uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 process, there is substantial doubt

  N  OTES     TO   C  ONSOLIDATED   F  INANCIAL   S  TATEMENTS

regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result from the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  For additional information, please see  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, as well as  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. 
  Use of Estimates  .  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in, but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability and valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, inventory reserves, income taxes, and share-based compensation.  The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, or as additional information is obtained and as the Company s operating environment changes. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  .    For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash is defined as cash on-hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with initial maturities of three months or less.  The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in various financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.  Management believes that this risk is not significant.  Cash balances related to the Company's captive insurance subsidiaries, which totaled $16.7 million and $18.3 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets, and the Company expects to use these cash balances to fund the operations of the captive insurance subsidiaries and to settle future anticipated claims. 
    
  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  .    Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to customers.  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information and existing economic conditions.  Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it is deemed probable that the customer will not make the required payments at either the contractual due dates or in the future.       
    
  Inventories  .    Inventories for the Completion Services segment consist of finished goods, including equipment components, chemicals, proppants, supplies and materials for the segment s operations.  Inventories for the Other Services segment consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including equipment components, supplies and materials.  
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value) on a first-in, first-out basis and appropriate consideration is given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): 

On June 29, 2016, the Company sold a majority of the assets comprising their specialty chemicals supply business, including inventory, for approximately $9.3 million of net cash. 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment  .    Property, plant and equipment (PP E) are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation.  The cost of property and equipment currently in service is depreciated, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 25 years.  Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the related assets, are charged to expense when incurred.  Refurbishments are capitalized when the value of the

  N  OTES     TO   C  ONSOLIDATED   F  INANCIAL   S  TATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

equipment is enhanced for an extended period.  When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operating income. 
    
  PP E are evaluated on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events ) that indicate the carrying value of certain PP E may not be recoverable.  PP E are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event.  An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of PP E is not recoverable.  The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets with such cash flows to be realized over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group, excluding interest expense.  The Company determined the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are independent of other asset groups to be at the service line level, which consists of the well services, hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, wireline, pumpdown, directional drilling services and products, cementing, artificial lift applications, international coiled tubing, equipment manufacturing and repair services, and data acquisition and control instruments provider service lines as well as the vertically integrated research and technology service line.  If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for a given asset group is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value of the related assets.  The impairment loss is then allocated across the asset group's major classifications. 
    
  The Company concluded that the sharp fall in commodity prices during the second half of 2014 constituted a triggering event that resulted in a significant slowdown in activity across the Company s customer base, which in turn has increased competition and put pressure on pricing for its services throughout 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016.  Although the severity and extent of this continued downturn is uncertain, absent a significant recovery in commodity prices, activity and pricing levels may continue to decline in future periods.  As a result of the triggering event during the fourth quarter of 2014, PP E recoverability testing was performed throughout 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016 on the asset groups in each of the Company s service lines.  For the first six months of 2016, the recoverability testing for the coiled tubing, directional drilling, cementing, artificial lift applications and international coiled tubing asset groups yielded an estimated undiscounted net cash flow that was less than the carrying amount of the related assets.  The estimated fair value for each respective asset group was compared to its carrying value, and impairment expense of $61.1 million was recognized during the first half of 2016 and allocated across each respective asset group's major classification.  The impairment charge was primarily related to underutilized equipment in the Completion Services and Other Services segments.  The fair value of these assets was based on the projected present value of future cash flows that these assets are expected to generate.  Should industry conditions not significantly improve or worsen, additional impairment charges may be required in future periods.  Recoverability testing at September 30, 2016 resulted in no additional PP E impairment charge.   
    
  On June 29, 2016, the Company sold a majority of the assets comprising their specialty chemicals supply business, including PP E, for approximately $9.3 million of net cash. 
  Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets  .    Goodwill is allocated to the Company s three reporting units: Completion Services, Well Support Services and Other Services, all of which are consistent with the presentation of the Company s three reportable segments.  At the reporting unit level, the Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31 of each year, or when certain events or changes in circumstances (referred to as "triggering events") indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable and that a potential impairment exists.  
  Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested for impairment more frequently than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, market changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments.  During the third quarter of 2015, sustained low commodity price levels and the resulting impact on the Company s results of operations, coupled with the sustained weakness in the Company s share price were deemed triggering events that led to an interim period test for goodwill impairment.  During the first quarter of 2016, commodity price levels remained depressed which materially and negatively impacted the Company's results of operations, and the further declines in the Company's share price led to another interim period test for goodwill impairment.  See Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on impairment testing results  . 
  Before employing detailed impairment testing methodologies, the Company may first evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each reporting unit, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value.  If the Company first utilizes a qualitative approach and determines that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, detailed testing methodologies are then applied. Otherwise, the Company concludes that no impairment has occurred.  Detailed impairment testing, or Step 1 testing, involves comparing the  
  
   -  9  - 

    C J ENERGY SERVICES LTD. (DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION) AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  N  OTES     TO   C  ONSOLIDATED   F  INANCIAL   S  TATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.  Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss.  The second step, or Step 2 testing, includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. 
  The Company s Step 1 impairment analysis involves the use of a blended income and market approach.  Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit.  Critical assumptions include projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross profit rates, sales, general and administrative ("SG A") rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and price-to-earnings multiples.  The Company s market capitalization is also used to corroborate reporting unit valuations. 
  Similar to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  
  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  These intangibles are reviewed for impairment when a triggering event indicates that the asset may have a net book value in excess of recoverable value. In these cases, the Company performs a recoverability test on its definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset for recoverability.  If the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment does not exist and a loss will not be recognized.  If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is not recoverable and the amount of impairment must be determined by fair valuing the asset. 
  For further discussion of the application of this accounting policy regarding impairments, please see Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  . 
  Revenue Recognition  . All revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is complete or the equipment has been delivered to the customer, the amount is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as follows: 
  Completion Services Segment 
  Hydraulic Fracturing Revenue.    Through its hydraulic fracturing service line, the Company provides hydraulic fracturing services on a spot market basis or pursuant to contractual arrangements, such as term contracts and pricing agreements.  Under either scenario, revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced upon the completion of each job, which can consist of one or more fracturing stages.  Once a job has been completed to the customer s satisfaction, a field ticket is written that includes charges for the service performed and the consumables (such as fluids and proppants) used during the course of service.  The field ticket may also include charges for the mobilization and set-up of equipment, the personnel on the job, any additional equipment used on the job, and other miscellaneous consumables. 
  Rates for services performed on a spot market basis are based on an agreed-upon hourly spot market rate for a specified number of hours of service. 
  Pursuant to pricing agreements and other contractual arrangements which the Company may enter into from time to time, such as those associated with an award from a bid process, customers typically commit to targeted utilization levels based on a specified number of hours of service at agreed-upon pricing, but without termination penalties or obligations to pay for services not used by the customer.  In addition, the agreed-upon pricing is typically subject to periodic review, as specifically defined in the agreement, and may be adjusted upon the agreement of both parties. 
  Cased-Hole Wireline Revenue.    Through its cased-hole wireline service line, the Company provides cased-hole wireline logging, perforating, pressure pumping, well site make-up and pressure testing and other complementary services, on a spot market basis. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few hours to multiple days.  The Company typically charges the customer for these services on a per job basis at agreed-upon spot market rates.  Revenue is recognized based on a field ticket issued upon the completion of the job.

  (Unaudited) 

Coiled Tubing and Other Stimulation Services Revenue.    Through its coiled tubing service line, the Company provides a range of coiled tubing and other well stimulation services, including nitrogen and pressure pumping services, primarily on a spot market basis.  Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few hours to multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon completion of each day s work based upon a completed field ticket.  The field ticket includes charges for the services performed and the consumables (such as stimulation fluids, nitrogen and coiled tubing materials) used during the course of service.  The field ticket may also include charges for the mobilization and set-up of equipment, the personnel on the job, any additional equipment used on the job, and other miscellaneous consumables.  The Company typically charges the customer for the services performed and resources provided on an hourly basis at agreed-upon spot market rates.   
  Revenue from Materials Consumed While Performing Certain Completion Services.    The Company generates revenue from consumables used during the course of providing services. 
  With respect to hydraulic fracturing services, the Company generates revenue from the fluids, proppants and other materials that are consumed while performing a job. For services performed on a spot market basis, the required consumables are typically provided by the Company and the customer is billed for those consumables at cost plus an agreed-upon markup. For services performed on a contractual basis, when the consumables are provided by the Company, the customer typically is billed for those consumables at a negotiated contractual rate. When consumables are supplied by the customer, the Company typically charges handling fees based on the amount of consumables used. 
  In addition, ancillary to coiled tubing and other stimulation services revenue, the Company generates revenue from stimulation fluids, nitrogen, coiled tubing materials and other consumables used during those processes. 
  Well Support Services Segment 
  Rig Services Revenue.    Through its rig service line, the Company primarily provides workover and well servicing rigs that are involved in routine repair and maintenance, completions, re-drilling and plug and abandonment operations.  These services are provided on an hourly basis at prices that approximate spot market rates.  Revenue is recognized and a field ticket is generated upon the earliest of the completion of a job or at the end of each day.  A rig services job can last anywhere from a few hours to multiple days depending on the type of work being performed.  The field ticket includes the base hourly rate charge and, if applicable, charges for additional personnel or equipment not contemplated in the base hourly rate. 
  Fluids Management Services Revenue.    Through its fluids management service line, the Company primarily provides transportation, storage and disposal services for fluids used in the drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas wells.  Rates for these services vary and can be on a per job, per hour or per load basis, or on the basis of quantities sold or disposed.  Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each job or load, or delivered product, based on a completed field ticket. 
  Other Special Well Site Services Revenue.    Through its other special well site service line, the Company primarily provides fishing, contract labor, and tool rental services for completion and workover of oil and gas wells.  Rates for these services vary and can be on a per job, per hour or on the basis of rental days per month. Revenue is recognized based on a field ticket issued upon the completion of each job or on a monthly billing for rental services provided. 
    
  Other Services Segment 
  Revenue within the Other Services Segment is generated from certain of the Company's smaller service lines and divisions, specifically including cementing services, equipment manufacturing and repair services, which includes the sale of oilfield parts and supplies used in completion and production services, and research and technology.  Additionally, the Company manages several of its vertically integrated business through its research and technology division, including its directional drilling services and products, its data acquisition and control instruments provider and its artificial lift applications provider. 
  With respect to its directional drilling services, the Company provides these services on a spot market basis.  Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few days to multiple weeks.  The Company typically charges the customer for some of its directional drilling services on a per day basis, while other components are

charged based upon the amount of footage drilled.  Revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced upon the completion of each job.  Once a job has been completed to the customer s satisfaction, a field ticket is written that includes charges for the service performed.  
  With respect to its cementing services, the Company provides these services on a spot market or project basis. Jobs for these services are typically short-term in nature and are generally completed in a few hours.  The Company typically charges the customer for these services on a per job basis at agreed-upon spot market rates or agreed-upon job pricing for a particular project.  Revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced upon the completion of each job. Once a job has been completed to the customer s satisfaction, a field ticket is written that includes charges for the service performed and the consumables (such as blended bulk cement and chemical additives) used during the course of service.   
  With respect to its equipment manufacturing and repair services, data acquisition and control instruments provider and artificial lift applications provider, the Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufactured equipment and products.  Revenue is recognized upon the completion, delivery and customer acceptance of each order. 
  Share-Based Compensation  .    The Company s share-based compensation plans provide the ability to grant equity awards to the Company s employees, consultants and non-employee directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , only nonqualified stock options and restricted shares had been granted under such plans.  The Company values option grants based on the grant date fair value by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and values restricted share grants based on the closing price of C J s common shares on the grant date.  The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Further information regarding the Company s share-based compensation arrangements and the related accounting treatment can be found in Note 5   Share-Based Compensation. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  .    The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and capital lease obligations.  The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the Debtor-in-Possession credit facility approximate their fair values given the short-term nature of these instruments.  The following table compares the carrying value of the Company's term debt instruments to their fair value as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of September 30, 2016, the Five-Year Term Loans and the Seven-Year Term Loans are classified as liabilities subject to compromise in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  (See Note 3   Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for further discussion regarding the Company s Credit Facilities and for the meaning of all defined terms contained within this Fair Value of Financial Instruments section): 

The Company estimated the fair values of its term debt using quoted market prices in an active market.  As a result, the Company considers this a Level 1 fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy.   
  Equity Method Investments  .  The Company has investments in joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the joint venture.  Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.  Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company s share of undistributed earnings and losses of these investments.  The Company eliminates all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees, from the consolidated financial results. 
  Income Taxes  .    The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are  
  
   -  12  - 

    C J ENERGY SERVICES LTD. (DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION) AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  N  OTES     TO   C  ONSOLIDATED   F  INANCIAL   S  TATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. 
  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  In assessing the likelihood and extent that deferred tax assets will be realized, consideration is given to projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.  A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has federal, state and international net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in the years 2021 through 2036.  After considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, the Company established a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets. 
  The Company expects that most, if not all of its net operating loss carryforwards will be eliminated as a result of the cancellation of certain of its debt pursuant to the reorganization.  Furthermore, to the extent that any net operating loss carryforwards remain after the reorganization, the Company's ability to use such net operating loss carryforwards would likely be significantly limited because the reorganization will constitute an  ownership change  as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
  The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.  A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority.  Previously recognized tax positions are reversed in the first period in which it is no longer more-likely-than-not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination.  Income tax related interest and penalties, if applicable, are recorded as a component of the provision for income tax expense.  The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The effective tax rate was a benefit of   13.3%   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to a   16.5%   provision for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The effective tax rate, and resulting benefit, is less than the expected statutory rate primarily due to impairment charges recorded in the first half of 2016 that were not deductible for tax and valuation allowances applied against certain deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards.   
  Earnings (Loss) Per Share  .   Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period and excludes shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted shares.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus, when their effect is dilutive, incremental shares consisting of shares subject to outstanding stock options and restricted shares. 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the components of the basic and diluted loss per share calculations for the applicable periods:

A summary of securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted loss per share is presented below for the applicable periods: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  .  In   May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.    In August 201  5, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2015-14")  ,   which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year and is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  ASU 2015-14 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.    The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, S  implifying the Measurement of Inventory   ("ASU 2015-11"), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is part of the FASB s simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out ("LIFO") or the retail inventory method.  The guidance will require prospective application at the beginning of the Company's first q  uarter of fiscal 2018, but permits adoption in an earlier period.    The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.  The Company is required to adopt this ASU for years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and the guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01").  ASU 2016-01 improves upon U.S. GAAP by, among other things, (1) requiring equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (3) eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and (4) clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  The Company is required to adopt this ASU for years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU No. 2016-02 seeks to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Unlike current U.S. GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU No. 2016-02 will require both operating and finance leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Additionally, the new guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"), to simplify certain provisions in stock compensation accounting, including the simplification of accounting for a stock payment's tax consequences.  The ASU amends the guidance for classifying awards as either equity or liabilities, allows companies to estimate the number of stock awards they expect to vest, and revises the tax withholding requirements for stock awards.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12"), to clarify in the FASB's revenue recognition standard the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract, the guidance for presenting sales taxes and similar taxes, and the timing for measuring customer payments that are not in cash.    The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends U.S. GAAP by introducing a new impairment model for financial instruments that is based on expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses. The new impairment model applies to most financial assets, including trade accounts receivable.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although it may be adopted one year earlier, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments:  A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force   ("ASU 2016-15"), which makes target changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ("ASU 2016-16"), which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than an intra-entity asset transfer of inventory, when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years,

Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding 
  Overview 
  On July 8, 2016, C J and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including C J Corporate Services (Bermuda) Ltd. (together with C J, collectively the  Bermudian Entities ), C J Energy Production Services-Canada Ltd. and Mobile Data Technologies Ltd. (together, the  Canadian Entities ), entered into a Restructuring Support and Lock-Up Agreement (the  Restructuring Support Agreement ), with certain lenders (the  Supporting Lenders ) holding approximately 90% of the secured claims and interests arising under the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 24, 2015 (as amended and otherwise modified, the  Credit Agreement ).  The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the implementation of a restructuring of the Company, including eliminating all amounts owed under the Company s Credit Agreement, through a debt-to-equity conversion and equity rights offering, which transaction will be effectuated through a plan of reorganization (the  Restructuring Plan ) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 ( Chapter 11 ) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ), which will be subject to the approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the  Bankruptcy Court ).  
  To implement the restructuring, on July 20, 2016 (the "Petition Date"), the Company and certain other subsidiaries of the Company (the "Debtors" or the "Reorganized Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the "Bankruptcy Petitions") seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Court.  These Chapter 11 cases are being administered under the caption "  In re:  CJ Holding Co., et al., Case No. 16-33590  ", and the Company commenced ancillary proceedings in Canada on behalf of the Canadian Entities and a provisional liquidation proceeding in Bermuda on behalf of the Bermudian Entities (collectively, the "Chapter 11 Proceeding"). Throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding, the Debtors will continue operations and management of their assets in the ordinary course as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.  
  In accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Debtors filed the Restructuring Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on August 19, 2016, with a first amendment to the Restructuring Plan filed on September 28, 2016 and a second amendment filed on November 3, 2016.  The key terms of the restructuring included in the Restructuring Plan are as follows: 
     Debt-to-equity Conversion:  The Supporting Lenders will be issued new common equity in the reorganized Company ("New Equity"), and all of the existing shares of C J common equity will be canceled as of the effective date of the Restructuring Plan (the "Effective Date"). 
     The Rights Offering:  Certain of the Supporting Lenders (the "Backstop Parties") have agreed to provide an equity rights offering for an investment in the Company in an amount of up to $200 million as part of the approved Restructuring Plan (the  Rights Offering ).  The Rights Offering will be consummated on the Effective Date pursuant to a Backstop Commitment Agreement, which will also provide for a commitment premium of 5% of the $200 million committed amount payable in New Equity to the Backstop Parties (the  Backstop Fee ).  The Rights Offering shares will be issued at a price that reflects a discount of 20% to the Restructuring Plan value, provided that the Restructuring Plan value will not be greater than $750 million. 
     DIP Facility:  Certain of the Supporting Lenders (the  DIP Lenders ) are providing a superpriority secured delayed draw term loan facility to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million (the  DIP Facility ).  As further discussed below, on July 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility on an interim basis, pending a final hearing.  On July 29, 2016, the Debtors entered into a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit agreement, among the Debtors, the DIP Lenders and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Administrative Agent (the  DIP Credit Agreement ), which sets forth the terms and conditions of the DIP Facility.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order approving entry into the DIP Facility and DIP Credit Agreement.  The Company is required to repay all amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility on the Effective Date. 
     The Exit Facility:  The Company is evaluating various financing options which will take effect upon emergence from its Chapter 11 proceeding, including entry into a senior secured revolving asset-based lending credit facility to

  (Unaudited) 

be arranged and provided by one or more commercial lending institutions in a minimum amount of $100 million (the "Exit Facility").  Entry into the Exit Facility will require that the Debtors, the Backstop Parties and certain other Supporting Lenders agree that such a financing facility is in the best interests of the Reorganized Debtors. 
     The New Warrants:  On the Effective Date, the Company will issue new seven-year warrants exercisable on a net-share settled basis into up to 6% of the New Equity at a strike price of $1.55 billion (the  New Warrants ).  New Warrants representing up to 2% of the New Equity will be issued to existing holders of C J common equity, provided that such holders vote as a class to accept the Restructuring Plan, and the remaining New Warrants representing up to 4% of the New Equity will be issued to the Debtors' general unsecured creditors.   
     Distributions:  The DIP Lenders will receive payment in full in cash on the Effective Date from cash on hand and proceeds from the Rights Offering and Exit Facility, as applicable.  The Supporting Lenders will receive all of the New Equity, subject to dilution on account of the Management Incentive Plan (as defined below), the Rights Offering, the Backstop Fee and the New Warrants, along with all of the subscription rights under the Rights Offering.  Under the Restructuring Plan, mineral contractor claimants will be paid in full in the ordinary course of business.  Additionally, subject to the terms of the Plan, certain other unsecured claimants will share in a $33.0 million cash recovery pool, plus a portion of the New Warrants, as described above.  
     Management Incentive Plan:  10% of the New Equity will be reserved for a management incentive program to be issued to management of the reorganized Company after the Effective Date at the discretion of the board of the reorganized Company (the  Management Incentive Plan ). 
     Governance:  The board of the reorganized Company will be appointed by the Supporting Lenders and will include the reorganized Company s Chief Executive Officer. 
     Releases:  The Restructuring Plan contemplates certain releases relating to the Company, the Supporting Lenders, including the Backstop Parties and DIP Lenders, the UCC and its members, and holders of claims and interests, which will take effect upon the Effective Date. Further, all indemnification provisions for current and former directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, accountants, investments bankers, and other professionals of the Company, as applicable, will remain in place after the restructuring. 
  Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Supporting Lenders have agreed to, among other things: (a) use good faith efforts to implement the restructuring; (b) vote all claims and interests held in favor of the Restructuring Plan; (c) with respect to the Backstop Parties, backstop the Rights Offering; (d) support and not object or opt out of the release provisions under the Restructuring Plan so long as such release provisions are consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement term sheet; and (e) not exercise any right or remedy under the Credit Agreement against an affiliate of the Company that does not file for Chapter 11, subject to certain conditions. 
  The Restructuring Support Agreement contains certain Plan-related milestones, including deadlines: (a) to file the Restructuring Plan and related disclosure statement; (b) for entry of interim and final DIP orders; (c) for entry of the disclosure statement order; (d) for entry of the confirmation order; and (e) for the Effective Date to occur.  The Supporting Lenders may 
  agree to extend the foregoing milestones, and in one case the Supporting Lenders agreed to extend the milestone related to entry of the final order approving the DIP Facility. 
    
  On November 4, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement, finding that the Disclosure Statement contains adequate information as required by the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors intend to launch solicitation of acceptances of the Restructuring Plan, as required by the Bankruptcy Code, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.  A hearing with respect to confirmation of the Restructuring Plan is expected to take place on December 16, 2016, and the Company expects to emerge from the Chapter 11 Proceeding in the following weeks. 
    
  Reorganization Process 
  On and after the Petition Date, the Bankruptcy Court issued certain additional interim and final orders with respect to the Company's  first-day motions and other operating motions that allow the Company to operate the business in the ordinary course.  The first-day motions provided for, among other things, the payment of certain pre-petition employee expenses and benefits, the use of the Company s existing cash management system, the payment of certain pre-petition amounts to certain

  (Unaudited) 

critical vendors and mineral lien claimants, the ability to pay certain pre-petition taxes and regulatory fees, and the payment of certain pre-petition claims owed on account of insurance policies and programs.  With respect to those first-day motions for which only interim approval had been initially granted, the Bankruptcy Court has since issued final orders on all such motions as of September 30, 2016. 
  Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stayed the continuation of any judicial or administrative proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions.  Most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the Debtors  property, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are stayed unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay.   
  Under Section 365 and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions, including Supporting Lender approval in accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement. 
  Under Chapter 11, the Restructuring Plan will determine the rights and satisfaction of claims and interests of various creditors and security holders and will be subject to the ultimate outcome of negotiations and the Bankruptcy Court s decisions through the date on which the Restructuring Plan is confirmed.  As noted above, the Debtors filed the Restructuring Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on August 19, 2016 with a subsequent first amendment to the Restructuring Plan filed on September 28, 2016.  The proposed Restructuring Plan, among other things, provides mechanisms for treatment of the Debtors  pre-petition obligations, treatment of the Company s existing equity holders, potential income tax liabilities and certain corporate governance and administrative matters pertaining to the reorganized Company.  The proposed Chapter 11 plan was subject to revision prior to submission to the Bankruptcy Court based upon discussions with the Debtors  creditors, including the Supporting Lenders and other interested parties, and thereafter in response to further discussions with parties in interest and the Company's further analysis.  There can be no assurance that the Debtors will be able to secure approval for the Restructuring Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan from the Bankruptcy Court or that any Chapter 11 plan will be accepted by the Debtors  creditors. 
  Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before shareholders are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a Chapter 11 plan.  The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or shareholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation of the Restructuring Plan.  No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed to each of these constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if any, they would receive.  The Restructuring Plan and any other proposed Chapter 11 plan could result in holders of certain liabilities and/or securities, including common shares, receiving no distribution on account of their interests.  Because of such possibilities, there is significant uncertainty regarding the value of the Company's liabilities and securities, including its common shares.  At this time, there is no assurance the Company will be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully implement the Restructuring Plan or any other proposed Chapter 11 plan. 
  The Company has filed schedules and statements with the Bankruptcy Court setting forth, among other things, the assets and liabilities of each of the Debtors.  These schedules and statements may be subject to further amendment or modification after filing. Certain holders of pre-petition claims that are not governmental units are required to file proofs of claim by the deadline for general claims, (the  bar date ), which was set by the Bankruptcy Court as November 8, 2016.  Differences between amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims by creditors will be investigated and will be reconciled and resolved to within an immaterial amount in connection with the claims resolution process. In light of the expected number of creditors, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete and likely will continue after the Debtors emerge from bankruptcy. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known, nor can the ultimate recovery with respect to allowed claims be presently asserted  . 
  Liabilities Subject to Compromise 
  The Company has segregated liabilities and obligations whose treatment and satisfaction are dependent on the outcome of its reorganization under the Chapter 11 Proceeding and has classified these items as liabilities subject to compromise.  Generally, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of pre-petition liabilities of the Debtors, as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors, are stayed while the Company is subject to the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The ultimate

amount and treatment for these types of liabilities will be subject to the claims resolution processes in the Chapter 11 Proceeding and the terms of any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  Liabilities subject to compromise includes only those liabilities that are obligations of the Debtors and excludes the obligations of the Company's non-debtor subsidiaries.  Those liabilities subject to compromise may vary significantly from the stated amounts of claims filed with the Bankruptcy Court.  Obligations classified as liabilities subject to compromise may be subject to future adjustments depending on the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Proceeding, further developments with respect to potential disputed claims and/or determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims or other events.  Further, additional claims may arise subsequent to the Petition Date resulting from the rejection of executory contracts and from a determination by the Bankruptcy Court, or agreed to by parties in interest, of allowed claims for disputed amounts.  
  Interest expense incurred subsequent to the Company's Chapter 11 filing is recognized only to the extent that it will be paid during the cases or that it is probable that it will be an allowed claim.  Principal and interest payments may not be made on pre-petition debt subject to compromise without approval from the Bankruptcy Court or until a plan of reorganization defining the repayment terms, if any, has been confirmed.  In addition, the Bankruptcy Code generally disallows the payment of post-petition interest that accrues with respect to unsecured or undersecured claims.  As a result, the Company has not accrued interest that it believes is not probable of being treated as an allowed claim in the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not accrue interest totaling $26.6 million under the Credit Agreement subsequent to the Petition Date. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company classified the entire principal balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Five-Year Term Loans and the Seven-Year Term Loans (see Note 3 - Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for defined terms), as well as interest that was accrued but unpaid as of the Petition Date, as liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with ASC 852 -   Reorganizations  .  The components of liabilities subject to compromise are as follows (in thousands): 

Reorganization Items 
  The Company classifies all income, expenses, gains or losses that are incurred or realized as a result of the Chapter 11 Proceeding as reorganization items in its consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company reports professional fees and related costs associated with and incurred during the Chapter 11 Proceeding as reorganization items.  The components of reorganization items are as follows (in thousands):

On July 20, 2016, the Debtors filed Bankruptcy Petitions in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code under the caption    In re: CJ Holding Co., et al., Case No. 16-33590  .  The filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default with respect to the Company's Credit Agreement. As a result, the Company s pre-petition secured indebtedness under the Credit Agreement became immediately due and payable and any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  As of September 30, 2016, $1.3 billion of debt under the Company's Credit Agreement was classified as liabilities subject to compromise.   
  Additional information regarding the Chapter 11 Proceeding is included in Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding.  
  Credit Agreements 
  On March 24, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent and other lending parties (the  Original Credit Agreement ).  At the closing, the Original Credit Agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the "Credit Facilities") in an aggregate principal amount of   $1.66 billion  , consisting of (i) a revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility  or the  Revolver ) in the aggregate principal amount of   $600.0 million   and (ii) a term loan B facility ( Term Loan B Facility ) in the aggregate principal amount of   $1.06 billion  .  The Company simultaneously repaid all amounts outstanding and terminated Legacy C J s prior credit agreement; no penalties were due in connection with such repayment and termination.  The borrowers under the Revolver are the Company and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, specifically, CJ Lux Holdings S.  r.l. and CJ Holding Co.  The borrower under the Term Loan B Facility is CJ Holding Co.  All obligations under the Original Credit Agreement were guaranteed by the Company s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries.   
  On September 29, 2015, the Company obtained and entered into a waiver and certain amendments to the Original Credit Agreement (as amended by the amendments, the "Amended Credit Agreement").  The Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, suspended the quarterly maximum Total Leverage Ratio (as defined herein) and quarterly minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined herein) covenants set forth in the Original Credit Agreement.  The suspension of these financial covenants commenced with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 and was set to run through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017. Upon reinstatement of these covenants as of the quarter ending September 30, 2017, the required levels initially were to be more lenient than those in effect under the terms of the Original Credit Agreement and were to gradually adjust to those prior levels over the subsequent fiscal quarters.  
  On May 10, 2016, the Company obtained a temporary limited waiver agreement (the  Temporary Waiver ) from certain of the lenders pursuant to which, effective as of March 31, 2016, such lenders agreed to not consider a breach of the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant measured as of March 31, 2016 an event of default through May 31, 2016.  Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA is defined as total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), and net gain or loss on disposal of assets, and excludes, among other things, stock based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, and non-routine items. 
  On May 31, 2016, the Company obtained and entered into a forbearance agreement (the "Forbearance Agreement") with certain of the lenders pursuant to which, among other things, such lenders agreed not to pursue default remedies against the Company with respect to its breach of the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant or certain specified payment defaults.

On June 30, 2016, this forbearance was extended through July 17, 2016 pursuant to a second forbearance agreement (the  Second Forbearance Agreement ), and prior to the termination of the Second Forbearance Agreement, this forbearance period was once again extended through July 20, 2016.  The Second Forbearance Agreement provided that the forbearance would terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including the failure of the Company to enter into the Restructuring Support Agreement on or prior to July 8, 2016.  On July 8, 2016, the Company entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement with the Supporting Lenders.  The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the implementation of a restructuring of the Company through a debt-to-equity conversion and Rights Offering, which transaction will be effectuated through the Restructuring Plan, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.   
  On July 20, 2016, the Debtors filed Bankruptcy Petitions in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under Chapter 11.  Additional information, including definitions of capitalized defined terms, regarding the Chapter 11 Proceeding is included in Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding. 
  DIP Facility 
  In connection with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, the Company filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval of debtor-in-possession financing on the terms set forth in a contemplated $100 million Superpriority Secured Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the  DIP Credit Agreement ).  On July 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving, on an interim basis, the financing to be provided pursuant to the DIP Facility, and on July 29, 2016, the DIP Credit Agreement was entered into by and among the Company, the other Debtors, the DIP Lenders and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as administrative agent.  Under the terms of the interim order, the Debtors were authorized to access $25 million in funding under the DIP Facility, and on July 29, 2016, the Company accessed $25 million under the DIP Facility.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the final order authorizing the Debtors' entry into the DIP Facility and DIP Credit Agreement, allowing the Company to access up to $100 million under the DIP Facility.   
  The DIP Facility provides for financial covenants that include budget variance limitations and limitations on capital expenditures.  A rolling 13 week cash budget projecting sources and uses of cash is required to be provided to the DIP Lenders every four weeks.  Budget variances are tested against each of the first four weeks of each refreshed budget as of the last business day of each week.  For each of the testing periods set forth in the table below, aggregate receipts of the Company and its subsidiaries must not be less than the applicable variance percentage for receipts as reflected in the table below, and aggregate operating disbursements (excluding professional fees and related expenses) made by the Company and its subsidiaries must not be greater than the applicable variance percentage for disbursements as reflected in the table below.

The DIP Facility matures on the earliest of (a) March 31, 2017 or (b) the date of the substantial consummation of a reorganization plan that is confirmed pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
    
  Amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility bear interest based on, at the option of the borrower, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a rate of 9.00% with a 1.00% LIBOR floor or an alternative base rate plus 8.00%. The DIP Facility also requires that the Company pay a commitment fee equal to 5.00% per annum times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans.  
    
  The DIP Facility contained an original issue discount equal to 2.00% of the DIP commitments and contains a prepayment fee of 2.00% if the DIP loans are prepaid with the proceeds of another financing during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. 
    
  The DIP Credit Agreement contains customary restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures and prepay certain indebtedness. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $25.0 million was outstanding under the DIP Facility with remaining borrowing capacity of $75.0 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the DIP Facility was   10.0%  . 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Revolver was scheduled to mature on March 24, 2020 (except that if any Five-Year Term Loans (as defined herein) had not been repaid prior to September 24, 2019, the Revolver was scheduled to mature on September 24, 2019).  Borrowings under the Revolver are non-amortizing.  Amounts outstanding under the Revolver bore interest based on, at the option of the borrower, LIBOR or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin determined pursuant to a pricing grid based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness of C J and its subsidiaries to Consolidated EBITDA of C J and its subsidiaries for the most recent four fiscal quarter period for which financial statements are available (the  Total Leverage Ratio ). 
  On July 20, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions which constituted an event of default under the Credit Agreement and accelerated the Revolver indebtedness to become immediately due and payable; however, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement entered into on July 8, 2016, holders of the Revolver will receive their pro rata share of 100% of the New Equity in the reorganized company, subject to dilution from the issuance of New Equity on account of the Management Incentive Plan, the Rights Offering, the Backstop Fee and the New Warrants as discussed further in Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding.  However, even if the Restructuring Plan meets other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors may not vote in favor of the Restructuring Plan, and certain parties in interest may file objections to the Restructuring Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that the Company has not satisfied the confirmation requirements under section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. Further, even if no objections are filed and the requisite acceptances of the Restructuring Plan are received from creditors entitled to vote on the Restructuring Plan, the Bankruptcy Court, which can exercise substantial discretion, may not confirm the Restructuring Plan. 
  Term Loan B Facility 
  Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility were comprised of two tranches: a tranche consisting of   $575.0 million   in original aggregate principal amount of term loans that were to mature on March 24, 2020 (the  Five-Year Term Loans ) and

a tranche consisting of a   $485.0 million   in original aggregate principal amount of term loans that were to mature on March 24, 2022 (the  Seven-Year Term Loans ).  The Company was required to make quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum, with the remaining balance payable on the applicable maturity date.  
  Five-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bore interest based on, at the option of the Company, (i) LIBOR subject to a floor of   1.00%   per annum, plus a margin of   5.50%  , or (ii) an alternative base rate, plus a margin of 4.50%. Seven-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bore interest based on, at the option of the Company, (i) LIBOR subject to a floor of 1.00% per annum, plus a margin of 6.25%, or (ii) an alternative base rate, plus a margin of 5.25%. The Term Loan B Facility also contained  most favored nation  pricing protection requiring that if the effective yield (giving effect to, among other things, consent fees paid to the lenders) of the Five-Year Term Loans increased by more than 50 basis points, the effective yield of the Seven-Year Term Loans must increase by the same amount less 50 basis points. 
  The alternative base rate was equal to the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) LIBOR plus 1.00%. 
  On July 20, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions which constituted an event of default under the Credit Agreement and accelerated the Term Loan B Facility indebtedness to become immediately due and payable; however, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement entered into on July 8, 2016, holders of the Term Loan B Facility debt will receive their pro rata share of 100% of the New Equity in the reorganized company, subject to dilution from the issuance of New Equity on account of the Management Incentive Plan, the Rights Offering, the Backstop Fee and the New Warrants as discussed further in Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding.  However, even if the Restructuring Plan meets other requirements under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors may not vote in favor of the Restructuring Plan, and certain parties in interest may file objections to the Restructuring Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that the Company has not satisfied the confirmation requirements under section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Further, even if no objections are filed and the requisite acceptances of the Restructuring Plan are received from creditors entitled to vote on the Restructuring Plan, the Bankruptcy Court, which can exercise substantial discretion, may not confirm the Restructuring Plan. 
    
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  In 2013, the Company entered into  build-to-suit  lease agreements for the construction of a new, technology-focused research and development facility and new corporate headquarters, respectively.  Each lease is accounted for as a capital lease.  In addition, the Company leases certain service equipment, with the intent to purchase, under non-cancelable capital leases.  The terms of these contracts range from   three   to   four   years with varying payment dates throughout each month. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had $32.7 million in capital lease obligations which were classified as liabilities subject to compromise. 
  In October 2016, the Company entered into amended lease agreements related to the Company s corporate headquarters and its research and technology facility, both originally entered into during 2013 and accounted for as capital leases.  The Company determined that both amended lease agreements qualify as a new operating lease under ASC 840 -   Leases  , which will result in accounting for the amended leases as a sale-leaseback pursuant to the requirements of ASC 840.  The conversion from capital lease to operating lease accounting treatment will result in the deferral of gain associated with the conversion with such deferred gain amortized into income over the remaining lease terms.   
    
  Interest Expense 
  As of June 30, 2016, based on the negotiations between the Company and the lenders, it became evident that the restructuring of the Company's capital structure would not include a restructuring of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, the Five-Year Term Loans and the Seven-Year Term Loans, and these debt obligations, as demand obligations, would not be paid in the ordinary course of business over the term of these loans.  As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company accelerated the amortization of the associated original issue discount and deferred financing costs, fully amortizing these amounts as of June 30, 2016.  In addition, the Company has not accrued interest that it believes is not probable of being treated as an allowed claim in the Chapter 11 Proceeding. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not accrue interest totaling $26.6 million under the Credit Agreement subsequent to the Petition Date.  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, interest expense consisted of the following (in thousands):

Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  During the first quarter of 2016, utilization and commodity price levels continued to fall towards unprecedented levels and the resulting negative impact on the Company s results of operations, coupled with the sustained decrease in the Company s stock price, were deemed triggering events that led to an interim period test for goodwill impairment.  The Company chose to bypass a qualitative approach and instead opted to employ the detailed Step 1 impairment testing methodologies discussed below. 
  Income approach 
  The income approach impairment testing methodology is based on a discounted cash flow model, which utilizes present values of cash flows to estimate fair value.  For the Completion Services and Well Support Services reporting units, the future cash flows were projected based on estimates of projected revenue growth, fleet and rig count, utilization, gross profit rates, SG A rates, working capital fluctuations, and capital expenditures.  For the Other Services reporting unit, the future cash flows were projected based primarily on estimates of future demand for manufactured and refurbished equipment as well as parts and service, gross profit rates, SG A rates, working capital fluctuations, and capital expenditures.  Forecasted cash flows for the three reporting units took into account known market conditions as of March 31, 2016, and management s anticipated business outlook, both of which have been impacted by the sustained decline in commodity prices. 
  A terminal period was used to reflect an estimate of stable, perpetual growth.  The terminal period reflects a terminal growth rate of 2.5% for all three reporting units, including an estimated inflation factor. 
    
  The future cash flows were discounted using a market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) of 14.5% for Completion Services, 14.0% for Well Support Services, and 16.0% for Other Services reporting units. These assumptions were derived from unobservable inputs and reflect management s judgments and assumptions. 
  Market approach 
  The market approach impairment testing methodology is based upon the guideline public company method.  The application of the guideline public company method was based upon selected public companies operating within the same industry as the Company.  Based on this set of comparable competitor data, price-to-earnings multiples were derived and a range of price-to-earnings multiples was determined for each reporting unit.  Selected market multiples were 10.6x for Completion Services, 10.5x for Well Support Services and 11.0x for Other Services reporting units.  
  The fair value determined under the market approach is sensitive to these market multiples, and a decline in any of the multiples could reduce the estimated fair value of any of the three reporting units below their respective carrying values. Earnings estimates were derived from unobservable inputs that require significant estimates, judgments and assumptions as

described in the income approach. 
  The estimated fair value determined under the income approach was consistent with the estimated fair value determined under the market approach.  The concluded fair value for the Completion Services and Well Support Services reporting units consisted of a weighted average, with an 80% weight under the income approach and a 20% weight under the market approach.  The concluded fair value for the Other Services reporting unit consisted of a weighted average with a 50% weight under the income approach and a 50% weight under the market approach. 
  The results of the Step 1 impairment testing indicated potential impairment in the Well Support Services reporting unit. The goodwill associated with both the Completion Services and Other Services reporting units was completely impaired during the third quarter of 2015.  As a way to validate the estimated reporting unit fair values, the total market capitalization of the Company was compared to the total estimated fair value of all reporting units, and an implied control premium was derived. Market data in support of the implied control premium was used in this reconciliation to corroborate the estimated reporting unit fair values. 
  Step 2 of the goodwill impairment testing for the Well Support Services reporting units was performed during the first quarter of 2016, and the results concluded that there was no value remaining to be allocated to the goodwill associated with this reporting unit.  As a result, the Company recognized impairment expense of $314.8 million during the first quarter of 2016.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there is no goodwill remaining to be allocated across the Company's three reporting units.  
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , are as follows (in thousands): 

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
  The Company had approximately $6.0 million of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which are subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
  The Company s intangible assets associated with intellectual property, research and development ( IPR D ) consist of technology that is still in the testing phase, and management continues to actively pursue development and planned marketing of the new technology.  Based on the Company's evaluation which includes successful test results within its research and development facilities, it was determined that the IPR D carry value of $6.0 million was not impaired as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Definite-Lived Intangible Assets 
  The Company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when a triggering event indicates that the asset

may have a net book value in excess of recoverable value.  During the first three quarters of 2016, management determined the sustained low commodity price levels coupled with the sustained decrease in the Company s share price were deemed triggering events that provided indicators that its definite-lived intangible assets may be impaired.  The Company performed a recoverability test on all of its definite-lived intangible assets which compares the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset for recoverability.  If the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment does not exist and a loss will not be recognized.  If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is not recoverable and the amount of impairment must be determined by fair valuing the asset.  
  Recoverability testing through June 30, 2016 resulted in the determination that certain intangible assets associated with the Company s wireline and artificial lift lines of business were not recoverable.  The fair value of the wireline and artificial lift assets was determined to be approximately $38.2 million and zero, respectively, resulting in impairment expense of $50.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively.  Recoverability testing at September 30, 2016 resulted in no additional impairment as the intangible assets assessed were determined to be recoverable. 
  The changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

Note 5 - Share-Based Compensation 
  Equity Plans 
  In connection with the Merger, the Company approved and adopted the C J Energy Services 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  2015 LTIP ), effective as of March 23, 2015, contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.  The 2015 LTIP served as an assumption of the Legacy C J 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, including the sub-plan titled the C J International Middle East FZCO Phantom Equity Arrangement (the  2012 LTIP ), with certain non-material revisions made and   no   increase in the number of shares remaining available for issuance under the 2012 LTIP.  Prior to the adoption of the 2015 LTIP, all share-based awards granted to Legacy C J employees, consultants and non-employee directors were granted under the 2012 LTIP and, following the 2015 LTIP s adoption, no further awards will be granted under the 2012 LTIP.  Awards that were previously outstanding under the 2012 LTIP will continue and remain outstanding under the 2015 LTIP, as adjusted to reflect the Merger.  At the closing of the Merger, restricted shares and stock option awards were granted under the 2015 LTIP to certain employees of the C P Business and approximately   0.4 million   C J common shares underlying those awards were deemed part of the consideration paid to Nabors for the Merger. 
    
  The 2015 LTIP provides for the grant of share-based awards to the Company s employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The following types of awards are available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP: incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards and share awards.    As of September 30, 2016   only nonqualified stock options and restricted shares have been awarded under the 2015 LTIP and 2012 LTIP. No grants were issued during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

A total of   4.3 million   common shares were originally authorized and approved for issuance under the 2012 LTIP and on June 4, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the First Amendment to the 2015 LTIP, which increased the number of common shares that may be issued under the 2015 LTIP by approximately 3.6 million shares.  The shareholders of the Company approved the Second Amendment to the 2015 LTIP in February 2016, which increased the number of common shares that may be issued by approximately 6.0 million shares. Including the add-back of approximately 0.9 million shares of canceled grants under the 2012 LTIP and 2015 LTIP during the first three quarters of 2016, approximately   10.6 million   common shares remain available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP as of   September 30, 2016  .  The number of common shares available for issuance under the 2015 LTIP is subject to adjustment in the event of a reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, split-up, issuance of warrants, rights or debentures, stock dividend, stock split or reverse stock split, cash dividend, property dividend, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, change in corporate structure or any similar corporate event or transaction.  The number of common shares available for issuance may also increase due to the termination of an award granted under the 2015 LTIP, the 2012 LTIP or the Prior Plans (as defined below), by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of the common shares. 
  Prior to the approval of the 2012 LTIP, all share-based awards granted to Legacy C J s employees, consultants and non-employee directors were granted under the C J Energy Services 2006 Stock Option Plan and subsequently under the C J Energy Services 2010 Stock Option Plans (collectively known as the  Prior Plans ).  No additional awards will be granted under the Prior Plans. 
    Stock Options 
  The fair value of each option award granted under the 2015 LTIP, the 2012 LTIP and the Prior Plans is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s common shares on the grant date.  For options granted prior to Legacy C J s initial public offering, which closed on August 3, 2011, the calculation of Legacy C J s share price involved the use of different valuation techniques, including a combination of an income and/or market approach.  Determination of the fair value was a matter of judgment and often involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  Additionally, due to the Company s lack of historical volume of option activity, the expected term of options granted is derived using the  plain vanilla  method. In addition, expected volatilities have been based on comparable public company data, with consideration given to the Company s limited historical data.  The Company makes estimates with respect to employee termination and forfeiture rates of the options within the valuation model.  The risk-free rate is based on the approximate U.S. Treasury yield rate in effect at the time of grant.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , approximately   0.3 million   replacement option awards were granted by the Company to employees.  No options were granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   5.0 million   options outstanding to employees and non-employee directors.  Option awards granted under the 2015 LTIP and the Prior Plans expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date and generally vest over   three   years of continuous service with one-third vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. 
  Restricted Shares 
    
  Historically, restricted shares were valued based on the closing price of the Company s common shares on the NYSE on the date of grant.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , approximately 2.8 million restricted shares were granted to employees and non-employee directors under the 2015 LTIP, including approximately 0.6 million replacement restricted shares, at fair market values ranging from $11.38 to $15.10 per share.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , no restricted shares were granted by the Company. 
  To the extent permitted by law, the recipient of an award of restricted shares will have all of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the underlying common shares, including the right to vote the common shares and to receive all dividends or other distributions made with respect to the common shares.  Dividends on restricted shares will be deferred until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed on the shares and will be held by the Company for the account of the recipient (either in cash or to be reinvested in restricted shares) until such time.  Payment of the deferred dividends and accrued interest, if any, shall be made upon the lapsing of restrictions on the restricted shares, and any dividends deferred in respect of any restricted shares shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of such restricted shares.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not issued any dividends.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately 1.0 million restricted shares outstanding to employees and non-employee directors.  During the first quarter of 2016, 0.8 million restricted shares were subject to accelerated vesting in accordance with the terms of the employee agreement of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer.  Restricted share awards granted under the 2015 LTIP generally vest over a   three  -year period from the grant date.  
  Prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, no modifications were made to the Company's 2015 LTIP. 
  As described in Note 2   Chapter 11 Proceeding, pursuant to the Restructuring Plan, the liquidation of C J Energy Services Ltd. will be completed under the laws of Bermuda, and all of the existing shares of C J common equity will be canceled as of the Effective Date.  Also, on the Effective Date, the Company will issue the New Warrants to the holders of the canceled C J common shares, provided that such class of holders votes to accept the Restructuring Plan.  As described in the Restructuring Plan, the Plan will include the new long-term Management Incentive Plan to be issued to management of the reorganized Company after the Effective Date at the discretion of the board of the reorganized Company.  The reorganized Company will reserve 10% of the New Equity for the Management Incentive Plan. 
   
  Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental Regulations   Liabilities 
  The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that establish standards and requirements for the protection of the environment.  The Company continues to monitor the status of these laws and regulations.  However, the Company cannot predict the future impact of such standards and requirements on its business, which are subject to change and can have retroactive effectiveness.  
  Currently, the Company has not been fined, cited or notified of any environmental violations that would have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position, liquidity or capital resources.  However, management does recognize that by the very nature of its business, material costs could be incurred in the near term to maintain compliance.  The amount of such future expenditures is not determinable due to several factors, including the unknown magnitude of possible regulation or liabilities, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions which may be required, the determination of the Company s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such expenditures are recoverable from insurance or indemnification. 
  Litigation 
  The Company is, and from time to time may be, involved in claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  Because there are inherent uncertainties in the ultimate outcome of such matters, it is presently not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of any pending or potential claims or litigation against the Company; however, management believes that the outcome of those matters that are presently known to the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Self-Insured Risk Accruals 
  The Company maintains insurance policies for workers  compensation, automobile liability, general liability, which also includes sudden and accidental pollution insurance, and property damage relating to catastrophic events.  These insurance policies carry self-insured retention limits or deductibles on a per occurrence basis.  The Company has deductibles per occurrence for: workers  compensation of   $1,000,000  ; automobile liability claims of   $1,000,000  ; general liability claims, including sudden and accidental pollution claims, of   $250,000  , plus an additional annual aggregate deductible of $250,000; and property damage for catastrophic events of   $25,000  . 
    
  Additionally, under the terms of the Separation Agreement, dated as of February 12, 2015, by and between the Company and Nabors, relating to the Merger, the Company assumed, among other liabilities, all liabilities of the C P Business to the extent arising out of or resulting from the operation of the C P Business at any time before, at or after the closing of the Merger, including liability for death, personal injury and property damage resulting from or caused by the assets, products and services of the C P Business; other than those liabilities relating to or resulting from any demand, claim, investigation or litigation pending or asserted in writing as of the closing of the Merger.  Any liability relating to or resulting from any claim or litigation asserted after the closing of the Merger, but where the underlying cause of action arose prior to that time, would not be covered by the Company s insurance policies.

Note 7 - Segment Information 
  In accordance with ASC 280 -   Segment Reporting  , the Company routinely evaluates whether its separate operating and reportable segments have changed.  This determination is made based on the following factors: (1) the Company s chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) is currently managing each operating segment as a separate business and evaluating the performance of each segment and making resource allocation decisions distinctly and expects to do so for the foreseeable future, and (2) discrete financial information for each operating segment is available. 
  Due to the transformative nature of the Merger, the CODM changed the way in which the Company is managed, including a revised segment approach in making performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions.  Discrete financial information was created to provide the segment information necessary for the CODM to manage the Company under the revised operating segment structure. As a result of this change in operating segments, the Company revised its reportable segments late in the first quarter of 2015.  The Company s revised reportable segments are: (i) Completion Services, (ii) Well Support Services and (iii) Other Services.  This segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by the Company s management, including its CODM, to make decisions regarding the Company s business, including performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions.  
  The following is a description of the reportable segments: 
  Completion Services 
  The Company provides hydraulic fracturing services, cased-hole wireline services, coiled tubing services and other well stimulation services through its Completion Services segment. 
  Well Support Services 
  The Company provides rig services, fluid management services and other special well site services through its Well Support Services segment. 
    
  Other Services 
  The Other Services segment is comprised of the Company s smaller service lines and divisions, including cementing services, equipment manufacturing and repair, research and technology and Middle Eastern operations; the Company manages several of its vertically integrated business through its research and technology division, including its directional drilling services and products, data acquisition and control instruments provider as well as its artificial lift applications provider.  Also included in the Other Services are intersegment eliminations and costs associated with activities of a general corporate nature. 
    
  The following tables set forth certain financial information with respect to the Company s reportable segments.

The CODM evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), net gain or loss on disposal of assets, acquisition-related costs, and non-routine items ( Adjusted EBITDA ), a non-GAAP financial measure, because Adjusted EBITDA is considered an important measure of each segment s performance.  In addition, management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of each segment s operating performance allows investors to make a direct comparison to competitors, without regard to differences in capital and financing structure.  Investors should be aware, however, that there are limitations inherent in using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of overall profitability because it excludes significant expense items.  An improving trend in Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of an improvement in the Company s profitability.  To compensate for the limitations in utilizing Adjusted EBITDA as an operating measure, management also uses U.S. GAAP measures of performance, including operating income (loss) and net income (loss), to evaluate performance, but only with respect to the Company as a whole and not on a segment basis.

Note 8 - Mergers and Acquisitions 
  Merger between Legacy C J and the C P Business of Nabors 
  On March 24, 2015, Legacy C J and Nabors completed the combination of Legacy C J with the C P Business. The resulting combined company, which was renamed C J Energy Services Ltd., is now one of the largest completion and production services providers in North America led by the former management team of Legacy C J.  At the closing of the combination, Nabors received total consideration of   $1.4 billion  , subject to working capital adjustments, in the form of   $688.1 million   in cash,   $5.5 million   in cash to reimburse Nabors for operating assets acquired prior to March 24, 2015, and   $714.8 million   in C J common shares.  The C J common share value was based upon Legacy C J s closing stock price on March 23, 2015 and consisted of approximately   62.5 million   C J common shares issued to Nabors and approximately   0.4 million   designated C J common shares attributable to replacement restricted share and share option awards issued to certain employees of the C P Business for the pre-acquisition-related employee service period.  Upon the closing of the combination, Nabors owned approximately   53%   of the outstanding and issued common shares of C J, with the remainder held by former Legacy C J shareholders.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Nabors owns approximately 52% of C J outstanding common shares.  
    
  On September 25, 2015, C J and Nabors agreed to a working capital adjustment of $43.4 million in favor of C J, which was accounted for as a reduction to the purchase price of the C P Business.    
    
  The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, Legacy C J and Nabors were required to determine both the accounting acquirer and the accounting acquiree with the accounting acquirer deemed to be the party possessing the controlling financial interest.  Irrespective of Nabors   53%   common share ownership in C J immediately following the closing of the Merger, Legacy C J and Nabors determined that Legacy C J possessed the controlling financial interest, based on, among other factors, the presence of a majority of Legacy C J directors on the C J board of directors and through the composition of C J senior management consisting almost entirely of the executive officers of Legacy C J.  Legacy C J and Nabors therefore concluded the business combination should be treated as a reverse acquisition with Legacy C J as the accounting acquirer. 
  C J financed the cash portion of the Merger and repaid previously outstanding revolver debt with borrowings drawn under the Original Credit Agreement which provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of   $1.66 billion  . See Note 3   Debt and Capital Lease Obligations for further discussion on the Company s Original Credit Agreement. 
  The purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, as shown below (in thousands).  The estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable, inventory, property plant and equipment, other intangible assets, taxes (including uncertain tax positions), and contingencies required significant judgments and estimates.

All of the goodwill associated with the Merger was allocated to the Completion Services and Well Support Services reporting units.  As part of the Company's interim test for goodwill impairment, during the third quarter of 2015, all of the goodwill allocated to the Completion Services reporting unit was written off.  In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, all of the goodwill allocated to the Well Support Services reporting unit was written off.  See Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion.  
  The purchase price was initially allocated to the net assets acquired during the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently adjusted during 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the measurement period based upon revised estimated fair values, as follows (in thousands): 

(1) The measurement period adjustments reflect changes in the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including income taxes. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances existing as of the date the Merger was consummated and did not result from intervening events subsequent to that date.   
  The fair value and gross contractual amount of accounts receivable acquired on March 24, 2015 was   $274.1 million   and   $296.2 million  , respectively.  Based on the age of certain accounts receivable, a portion of the gross contractual amount was estimated to be uncollectible. 
  Property, plant and equipment assets acquired consist of the following fair values (in thousands) and ranges of estimated useful lives.  As with fair value estimates, the determination of estimated useful lives requires judgments and assumptions. 

Other intangibles were assessed a fair value of   $42.0 million   with a weighted average amortization period of approximately   11   years.  These intangible assets consist of developed technology of   $19.6 million  , amortizable over   5       15   years, customer relationships of   $13.0 million  , amortizable over 15 years, trade name of   $8.5 million  , amortizable over   ten

years, and non-compete agreements of   $0.9 million  , amortizable over   five   years.  The amount allocated to goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill was allocated between C J s Completion Services and Well Support Services reporting units on the basis of historical levels of EBITDA with $141.4 million allocated to Completion Services and $315.4 million allocated to Well Support Services.  The goodwill recognized as a result of the Merger was primarily attributable to the expected increased economies of scale, capabilities, resources and geographic footprint of the combined company as well as the cost savings opportunities as C J expected to capitalize on synergies from the new combined company.  The tax deductible portion of goodwill and other intangibles is   $60.8 million   and   $22.3 million  , respectively. 
  The Company treated the Merger as a non-taxable transaction.  Such treatment resulted in the acquired assets and liabilities having carryover basis for tax purposes.  A deferred tax liability in the amount of   $208.9 million   was recorded to account for the differences between the preliminary purchase price allocation and carryover tax basis. 
  The results of operations for the C P Business that have been included in C J's consolidated financial statements from the March 24, 2015 acquisition date through September 30, 2015 include revenue of $582.0 million and a net loss of $(186.7) million.  The following unaudited pro forma results of operations have been prepared as though the Merger was completed on January 1, 2014.  Pro forma amounts are based on the purchase price allocation of the acquisition and are not necessarily indicative of results that may be reported in the future (in thousands, except per share data): 

Acquisition of Artificial Lift Provider    
  On May 18, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of ESP Completion Technologies LLC, a manufacturer of wellheads, artificial lift completion tools and electric submersible pumps ("Artificial Lift Provider") for approximately $34.0 million consisting of cash of approximately $13.6 million, a holdback of $6.0 million, and an earn-out valued at approximately $14.4 million on the acquisition date.  
  During the second quarter of 2016, C J and the sellers agreed to a working capital adjustment of $0.5 million in favor of C J, which was accounted for as a reduction to the purchase price of ESP Completion Technologies LLC.  The adjusted purchase price of $33.5 million was allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, as follows (in thousands):  

If Artificial Lift Provider is able to achieve certain levels of EBITDA over a three-year period, the Company will be obligated to make future tiered payments of up to $29.5 million.  This could result in a maximum total purchase price of $49.1

million.  The potential payment is considered contingent consideration.  At the acquisition date, the fair value of this earn-out was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation discounted cash flow model over many simulated possible future outcomes which yielded a value of $14.4 million.  The earn-out has been remeasured on a fair value basis each quarter and will continue to be remeasured each quarter until the contingent consideration is paid or expires.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the earn-out was estimated to have zero value.

  Introductory Note and Corporate Overview 
    
  C J Energy Services Ltd. is a Bermuda exempt company.  With our principal operating headquarters in Houston, Texas, we are one of the largest, integrated providers of completion and production services in North America, providing a full range of well construction, well completion, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America.  We were listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol  CJES  prior to the suspension of trading of our common shares on July 20, 2016, in connection with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding on July 20, 2016, as defined and discussed under  Recent Developments   Other Matters - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Restructuring Support Agreement  in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.  Our common shares resumed trading on the OTC Markets Group Inc. s OTC Pink under the symbol  CJESQ  on July 21, 2016. 
    
  Effective as of March 24, 2015, we completed the combination of C J Energy Services, Inc. ( Legacy C J ) with the completion and production services business (the  C P Business ) of Nabors Industries Ltd. ( Nabors ) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the  Merger Agreement ), dated as of June 25, 2014, by and among Legacy C J, Nabors, Nabors Red Lion Limited (subsequently renamed C J Energy Services Ltd.,  New C J ), Nabors CJ Merger Co. and CJ Holding Co.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Nabors separated the C P Business from the rest of its operations and consolidated this business under New C J.  A Delaware subsidiary of New C J then merged with and into Legacy C J, with Legacy C J continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New C J (such transactions  referred to collectively as the  Merger ).  Effective upon closing of the Merger (the  Effective Time ), shares of common stock of Legacy C J were converted into common shares of New C J on a 1-for-1 basis, New C J was renamed  C J Energy Services Ltd.  and its common shares began trading on the NYSE under the ticker  CJES,  which was previously used by Legacy C J following completion of our initial public offering in 2011.  After giving effect to the Merger, Nabors owned approximately 53% of our outstanding common shares, with Legacy C J shareholders owning the remaining 47% of our outstanding common shares.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Nabors owns approximately 52% of our outstanding common shares.  We are led primarily by the individuals who served as Legacy C J s executive officers prior to the Merger. 
  Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, following the closing of the Merger, New C J is the successor issuer to Legacy C J and is deemed to succeed to Legacy C J s reporting history under the Exchange Act.  Because Legacy C J was considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), Legacy C J is also considered the accounting predecessor of C J Energy Services Ltd.  
  Our results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   include the financial and operating results of both Legacy C J and the C P Business for the entire period.  Results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   include the financial and operating results of Legacy C J for the entire period and the C P Business for the period from the Effective Time through   September 30, 2015  .  Accordingly, comparisons of our results for the current period to the comparable prior year period may not be meaningful.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein, the terms  we,   us,   our,   the Company,   C J,  or like terms refer to Legacy C J and its subsidiaries when referring to time periods prior to the Effective Time and refer to New C J and its subsidiaries (which include Legacy C J and its subsidiaries) when referring to time periods subsequent to the Effective Time of the Merger. 
  Business Overview 
  We are one of the largest, integrated providers of completion and production services in North America.  We provide a full range of well construction, well completion, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America.  Our core service lines, which are involved in the entire life cycle of the well, include hydraulic fracturing, cased-hole wireline, coiled tubing, cementing, rig services, fluids management

     Table of Contents  

services and other special well site services.  We operate in all of the major oil and gas producing regions of the continental United States and Western Canada.   
  Demand for our services is primarily driven by, and therefore our operating and financial performance is heavily influenced by drilling, completion and production activity of our customers in the upstream exploration and production ("E P") business of the oil and gas industry, which in turn is significantly impacted by oil and gas prices.  In late 2014, oil prices began a substantial and rapid decline, and the severe weakness and volatility continued throughout 2015.  As we entered 2016, we experienced a sharp drop in activity across our customer base as operators reacted to further declines in oil prices and the deteriorating rig count.  The significant volatility and weakness in commodity prices has continued to date and oil prices have remained significantly lower than the industry has previously experienced in recent years.  With the continued market instability, many of our customers have stopped drilling and/or completing wells, while others have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection or stop operations altogether. 
  In response to this severe, prolonged downturn, over the course of 2015 and throughout 2016 to date, we have implemented various operational rightsizing measures, coupled with substantial cost-cutting efforts further described below, in an attempt to mitigate the liquidity strain brought on by significantly reduced utilization and pricing for our services.  In spite of our efforts, however, and due to the extremely depressed market conditions that materially and negatively impacted our results for the first quarter of 2016, we were unable to satisfy one of the financial covenants under our Credit Agreement required to be tested as of March 31, 2016.  Accordingly, and as a result of our substantial debt burden, throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter, we worked with our financial and legal advisors to analyze a variety of solutions to reduce our overall financial leverage, while maintaining a primary focus on preserving liquidity.  As part of this process, we engaged in discussions with certain of our lenders and other stakeholders to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure our balance sheet, which ultimately led to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding on July 20, 2016, as defined and further discussed under  Recent Developments   Other Matters - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Restructuring Support Agreement  in this Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.   
  Our business and financial and operational performance also reflects the impact of our long-term growth strategy, further discussed below, which we aggressively implemented following our initial public offering in July 2011 through mid-2015.  Our long-term growth strategy focused on strengthening, expanding and diversifying our business through: (1) the growth of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally, for our core service lines; and (2) strategic initiatives advancing service line diversification, vertical integration and technological advancement.  As a result of the prolonged industry downturn, during the first quarter of 2016, we began evaluating opportunities to monetize some of our vertically integrated businesses in order to enhance our liquidity position and reduce our overall cost structure. On June 29, 2016, we sold the majority of the assets comprising our specialty chemicals supply business, which we developed in-house in 2013, for approximately $9.3 million.  We are currently negotiating several other strategic divestitures and evaluating other opportunities to divest select non-core assets and businesses in line with our strategy of preserving liquidity and streamlining our business to better focus on the advancement of our core services lines to ensure we are strongly positioned to capitalize on the eventual market recovery.  However, there can be no assurance any such potential transactions will prove successful, or that we will be able to sell these assets or business lines on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
  Additionally, over the last several years we worked to establish an operational presence in key countries in the Middle East, and we currently have offices in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Oman.  Given the Company's financial position and in connection with recent changes in the Company's executive management team with a resulting shift in short- and long-term growth strategy, we re-evaluated our business plan with respect to the Middle East and determined it was appropriate to significantly scale back our investment in this area to preserve liquidity and focus on the advancement of our business in the U.S.  Accordingly, and following unsuccessful customer bids, we have now begun the process of unwinding our businesses in the Middle East.  
  As indicated above, in keeping with our long-term growth strategy, from our initial public offering in July 2011 through the closing of the Merger in March 2015, we rapidly grew our core business through the expansion of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally, and most notably through the Merger.  The combination of Legacy C J with the C P Business greatly expanded our scale, service offerings and geographic reach, increasing capacity for our existing services offerings and providing diversification through the additional services offerings of the C P Business with a stronger presence in all major domestic basins.  However, with the Merger closing during the early part of the prevailing market downturn, we have not been able to capitalize on many of the opportunities that we believe the diversified service offering and increased scale, customer base and geographic footprint of our combined company can provide in healthy market conditions.  Moreover, in response to difficult market conditions and also as part of our integration strategy, late in the first quarter of 2015, we began to rightsize the Company by stacking idle equipment, reducing headcount and consolidating facilities.  Since that time, we have continued to tightly manage the business with a focus on aligning our  
  
   -  46  - 

     Table of Contents  

operations to the rapidly deteriorating operating environment, primarily by stacking additional equipment, closing unprofitable facilities, further reducing headcount, and implementing stringent cost control measures to lower our operational cost structure, including reductions in compensation and benefits across the organization. 
  In implementing our growth strategy over the last few years, in addition to the Merger, we acquired an equipment manufacturing business in 2011 and a data acquisition and control systems business in 2013.  We utilize the equipment and products manufactured by these vertically integrated businesses in our day-to-day operations, and we also sell them to third-party customers in the global oilfield services industry.  We are currently evaluating opportunities to divest all or some of this equipment manufacturing business, potentially through multiple transactions.  In May 2015, we acquired an integrated business that designs, manufactures and installs electrical submersible pump systems and accessories primarily for artificial lift applications and is now developing a line of electrical submersible pump systems that are optimized for the small casing sizes typical of long horizontal wells.   
  Additionally, we have taken a multi-faceted, integrated approach to developing our directional drilling capabilities, which we manage through our research   technology division.  In April 2013, we acquired a provider of directional drilling technology and related downhole tools, and during the first half of 2014, we began manufacturing premium drilling motors in-house and offering our directional drilling services line to customers as a new service offering.  However, due to the substantial decline in the rig count and the competitive landscape for directional drilling services in the current market environment, we recently changed our business model and began providing our USBS directional drilling motor as a rental to other directional drilling providers.  This change in business strategy has enabled our proprietary technology to gain additional exposure to numerous E P companies, which has resulted in increased credibility, higher utilization and enhanced profitability.  As market conditions improve, we will continue to evaluate our directional drilling business strategy in order to maximize the benefits of this technology because we continue to believe our proprietary USBS directional drilling motor has the potential to deliver significant value to our organization, and to many of our customers, over the long-term.   
    
  Over the last several years we have also significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities, including the development of a state-of-the-art research and technology center with a team of engineers and support staff focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings, increase completion efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers.  We believe that one of the strategic benefits of this division is the ability to develop and implement new technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and industry demand.  Several of our research and technology initiatives are generating monthly cost savings for our completion services operations, which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns.  Additionally, several of these investments are delivering value-added products and services that, in addition to producing revenue, are generating demand from key customers.  We believe these capabilities can provide a competitive advantage as customers look for innovative means for extracting oil and gas in the most economical and efficient way possible.  That said, as with our other service lines and divisions, over the last year we have been forced to implement meaningful cost reductions that significantly scaled back the size and resources of this division. 
    
  Recent Developments   Other Matters 
    
  Chapter 11 Proceeding and Restructuring Support Agreement 
    
  In May 2016, we announced that we were not in compliance with the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant required to be tested as of March 31, 2016 ("Covenant Default") under the Credit Agreement governing our Credit Facilities, which is considered an event of default with respect to the Credit Agreement (Please see  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Our Credit Agreement  in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report for a description of the Credit Agreement, including the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant and Credit Facilities).  We also announced that we would be negotiating with our lenders to resolve this matter, and that we had initiated a process to explore strategic alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet and maximize the value of the Company. 
    
  On May 10, 2016, we obtained a temporary limited waiver agreement from certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement in respect of the Covenant Default, effective from March 31, 2016 through May 31, 2016, wherein such lenders agreed not to consider the Covenant Default an event of default through May 31, 2016.  On May 31, 2016, we obtained a forbearance agreement from certain of the lenders pursuant to which, among other things, such lenders agreed not to pursue default remedies against the Company with respect to the Covenant Default or certain subsequent specified payment defaults.  On June 30, 2016, this forbearance was extended through July 17, 2016 pursuant to a second forbearance agreement, and prior to such termination this forbearance period was once again extended through July 20, 2016.

     Table of Contents  

At the conclusion of the forbearance period, on July 20, 2016 ("Petition Date"), certain of our U.S. operating companies (collectively, the "U.S. Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for reorganization seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 ("Chapter 11") of the United States Bankruptcy Code ("Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court").  These Chapter 11 cases are being administered under the caption "  In re: CJ Holding Co., et al., Case No. 16-33590  ", and we also commenced ancillary proceedings in Canada on behalf of our Canadian subsidiaries (collectively, the "Canadian Debtors") and a provisional liquidation proceeding in Bermuda on behalf of the Company's ultimate parent company (C J Energy Services Ltd.) and certain Bermudian subsidiaries (collectively, the "Bermuda Debtors" and together with the U.S. Debtors and the Canadian Debtors, the "Debtors")(collectively, the "Chapter 11 Proceeding").  Throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding, we have continued, and we will continue, to manage and operate our business in the ordinary course as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. 
    
  Prior to commencing the Chapter 11 Proceeding, on July 8, 2016, we entered into a Restructuring Support and Lock-Up Agreement (together with all exhibits thereto, the  Restructuring Support Agreement ), with certain lenders (the  Supporting Lenders ) holding approximately 90% of the secured claims and interests arising under the Credit Agreement.  The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the implementation of a restructuring of the Company through a debt-to-equity conversion of approximately $1.4 billion of secured debt under the Credit Agreement and an equity rights offering, to be effectuated through a plan of reorganization (the  Restructuring Plan ), which will be subject to Bankruptcy Court approval as part of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The Restructuring Support Agreement contains certain Restructuring Plan-related milestones (the  Milestones ), including deadlines: (a) to file the Restructuring Plan and related disclosure statement; (b) for entry of interim and final orders related to the DIP Facility (as defined and discussed herein); (c) for entry of the disclosure statement order; (d) for entry of the confirmation order; and (e) for the Effective Date to occur.  The Supporting Lenders may agree to extend the foregoing Milestones, and the Milestone related to entry of the final order approving the DIP Facility was previously extended. 
    
  In accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement Milestone, on August 19, 2016, we filed the initial Plan of Reorganization and related Disclosure Statement, with the first amendment filed on September 28, 2016 and a second amendment filed on November 3, 2016  (collectively, and as amended by the first and second amendment, the  Restructuring Plan ).  The filing of these amendments represented important progress in moving the Company through the Chapter 11 Proceeding.   
    
  Recognizing that the pace of a court supervised process is not within our control, we have been working proactively with our stakeholders to facilitate a positive outcome as expeditiously as possible.  At this time, the Supporting Lenders together with the appointed fiduciary committee for holders of unsecured claims (the "UCC") support the Restructuring Plan, which we believe provides a fair and equitable recovery to our stakeholders.  We are optimistic that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Proceeding by year-end 2016 or early in the first quarter of 2017. 
    
  The Restructuring Plan currently provides, among other things, as follows:  

Rights Offering  :  Certain of the Supporting Lenders (the "Backstop Parties") have agreed to provide an equity rights offering for an investment in the Company in an amount of up to $200 million as part of the approved Restructuring Plan (the  Rights Offering ).  The Rights Offering will be consummated on the effective date of the Restructuring Plan (the  Effective Date ) pursuant to a Backstop Commitment Agreement, which will also provide for a commitment premium of 5% of the $200 million committed amount payable in new common equity of the reorganized Company ("New Equity") to the Backstop Parties (the  Backstop Fee ).  The Rights Offering shares will be issued at a price that reflects a discount of 20% to the Restructuring Plan value, provided that the Restructuring Plan value will not be greater than $750 million. 

DIP Facility  :  Certain of the Supporting Lenders (the  DIP Lenders ) have provided a superpriority secured delayed draw term loan debtor-in-possession financing facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million (the  DIP Facility ).  As further discussed below, on July 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility on an interim basis, pending a final hearing.  On July 29, 2016, we entered into a superpriority secured debtor-in-possession credit agreement, among the Debtors, the DIP Lenders and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Administrative Agent (the  DIP Credit Agreement ), which sets forth the terms and conditions of the DIP Facility.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order approving entry into the DIP Facility and DIP Credit Agreement. We believe that our current cash balance, along with this additional financing, will provide us with sufficient resources to support our businesses and continue our operations in the ordinary course through

the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  We are required to repay all amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility on the Effective Date of emergence of Chapter 11. 

Exit Facility  : We are evaluating various financing options which will take effect upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding, including entry into a senior secured revolving asset-based lending credit facility to be arranged and provided by one or more commercial lending institutions in a minimum amount of $100 million. Entry into the Exit Facility will require that the Debtors, the Backstop Parties and certain other Supporting Lenders agree that such financing facility is in the best interest of the reorganized Debtors. 

New Warrants  :  On the Effective Date, the Company will issue new seven-year warrants exercisable on a net-share settled basis into up to 6% of the New Equity at a strike price of $1.55 billion (the  New Warrants ).  New Warrants representing up to 2% of the New Equity will be issued to existing holders of C J common equity, provided that such holders vote as a class to accept the Restructuring Plan, and the remaining New Warrants representing up to 4% of the New Equity will be issued to the Debtors' general unsecured creditors.  

Distributions  :  The Supporting Lenders shall receive all of the New Equity, subject to dilution on account of the Management Incentive Plan (as defined below), the Rights Offering, the Backstop Fee and the New Warrants, along with all of the subscription rights under the Rights Offering.  Under the Restructuring Plan, mineral contractor claimants will be paid in full in the ordinary course of business.  Additionally, subject to the terms of the Plan, certain other unsecured claimants will share in a $33.0 million cash recovery pool, plus a portion of the New Warrants, as described above. 

Management Incentive Plan  :  10% of the New Equity will be reserved for a management incentive program to be issued to management of the reorganized Company after the Effective Date at the discretion of the board of directors of the reorganized Company (the  Management Incentive Plan ). 

Governance  :  The board of directors of the reorganized Company will be appointed by the Lenders and shall include the reorganized Company s Chief Executive Officer. 

Releases  :  The Restructuring Plan contemplates certain releases relating to the Company, the Supporting Lenders, including the Backstop Parties and DIP Lenders, the UCC and its members, and holders of claims and interests, which will take effect upon the Effective Date.  Further, all indemnification provisions for current and former directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, accountants, investments bankers, and other professionals of the Company, as applicable, will remain in place after the restructuring. 
       
  Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and as set out in the Restructuring Plan, the Supporting Lenders have agreed to, among other things: (a) use good faith efforts to implement the restructuring; (b) vote all claims and interests held in favor of the Restructuring Plan; (c) with respect to the Backstop Parties, backstop the Rights Offering; (d) support and not object or opt out of the release provisions under the Restructuring Plan so long as such release provisions are consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement term sheet; and (e) not exercise any right or remedy under the Credit Agreement against an affiliate of the Company that did not file for Chapter 11, subject to certain conditions. 
    
  Additionally, as indicated above, we have worked diligently with the UCC to resolve certain issues the UCC raised on behalf of our general unsecured creditors with respect to the Restructuring Plan. Ultimately we were able to resolve such issues with the UCC and the Restructuring Plan reflects a global compromise amongst the Debtors, the UCC and the Supporting Lenders.  As a result of this resolution, the UCC has agreed to support confirmation of the Restructuring Plan.   
  We believe that the compromises and settlements to be implemented pursuant to the Restructuring Plan preserve value by enabling the Debtors to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation with the UCC that could potentially delay emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  
    
  On July 21, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued certain interim and final orders with respect to our first-day motions and other operating motions that allow the Company to operate the business in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The first-day motions sought authorization for, among other things, the payment of certain pre-petition employee expenses and benefits, the use of the Company's existing cash management system, the payment of certain pre-petition amounts to certain critical vendors and mineral lien claimants, the ability to pay certain pre-petition taxes and regulatory fees, the payment of certain pre-petition claims owed on account of insurance policies and programs, and entry into the DIP Facility on an interim basis. With respect to those other first-day motions for which only interim approval had been initially granted, the Bankruptcy Court has since issued final orders on all such motions as of September 30, 2016.

On November 4, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement, finding that the Disclosure Statement contains adequate information as required by the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors intend to launch solicitation of acceptances of the Restructuring Plan as required by the Bankruptcy Code as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. A hearing with respect to confirmation of the Restructuring Plan is expected to take place on December 16, 2016, and we expect to emerge from the Chapter 11 Proceeding in the following weeks. 
    
  Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Chapter 11 Proceeding automatically stayed the continuation of any judicial or administrative proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date.  Most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the Debtors  property, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are stayed unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay. 
    
  Under Section 365 and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions, including Supporting Lender approval in accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement.  Generally, the assumption of a contract requires a Debtor to satisfy pre-petition obligations under the contract, which may include payment of pre-petition liabilities in whole or in part.  The assumption of a contract may also result in amendments to its terms. Rejection of a contract is typically treated as a breach occurring as of the moment immediately preceding the Petition Date. 
    
  Under Chapter 11, the Restructuring Plan will determine the rights and satisfaction of claims and interests of various creditors and security holders and will be subject to the ultimate outcome of negotiations and the Bankruptcy Court s decisions through the date on which the Restructuring Plan is confirmed.  The Restructuring Plan is subject to revision prior to submission to the Bankruptcy Court for approval at confirmation based upon discussions with the Debtors  creditors, including the Supporting Lenders and other interested parties, and thereafter in response to further discussions with parties in interest and the Debtors' further analysis.  There can be no assurance that the Debtors will be able to secure approval for the Restructuring Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan from the Bankruptcy Court or that any Chapter 11 plan will be accepted by the Debtors  creditors. 
    
  Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before shareholders are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a Chapter 11 plan.  The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or shareholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation of the Restructuring Plan.  No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed to each of these constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if any, they would receive.  The Restructuring Plan could result in holders of certain liabilities and/or securities, including our shareholders, receiving no distribution on account of their interests.  Because of such possibilities, there is significant uncertainty regarding the value of the Company's liabilities and securities, including its common shares.  At this time, there is no assurance we will be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully implement the Restructuring Plan. 
    
  For additional discussion of the known, material risks associated with the Chapter 11 Proceeding and the Company's ability to restructure as a going concern, please see  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, as well as  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in this Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.  
    
  Going Concern Uncertainty 
    
  As discussed above, the extremely depressed market conditions that significantly and negatively impacted our results for the first quarter of 2016 resulted in Covenant Default under our Credit Agreement, which ultimately led to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  This ongoing industry downturn also negatively impacted our operational and financial performance for the second and third quarters of 2016.  Both the severe, prolonged downturn and Chapter 11 Proceeding raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, improvements in market conditions and our ability to improve profitability, our ability to meet certain conditions of the Restructuring Support Agreement and obtain confirmation of the Restructuring Plan or another Chapter 11 plan by the Bankruptcy Court, and our ability to successfully implement the Restructuring Plan or another Chapter 11 plan.

Reportable Segments 
  We operate our business in the following three reportable segments: 
     Completion Services, which includes the hydraulic fracturing services, cased-hole wireline services, coiled tubing services and other well stimulation services of both Legacy C J and the C P Business. 
     Well Support Services, which includes the services lines acquired with the C P Business, specifically including rig services, fluid management services and other special well site services. 
     Other Services, which include Legacy C J s smaller service lines and divisions, including equipment manufacturing and repair, research and technology, and Middle East operations, as well as the C P Business  cementing services.  We manage several of our vertically integrated businesses through our research and technology division, including our directional drilling services and products, our data acquisition and control instruments provider and our acquired artificial lift applications provider.  Costs associated with general corporate activities and intersegment eliminations are also included in this Other Services segment.  
  Each of our reportable segments is described in more detail below.  For additional financial information about our reportable segments, see Note 7   Segment Information in Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in this Quarterly Report. 
  Completion Services 
  Our Completion Services segment consists of the following service lines: (1) hydraulic fracturing; (2) cased-hole wireline, which includes wireline logging, perforating, pressure pumping, well site make-up and pressure testing and other  
  
   -  52  - 

     Table of Contents  

complementary services; and (3) coiled tubing and other well stimulation services, including nitrogen and pressure pumping services.  The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our hydraulic fracturing services line. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, our hydraulic fracturing division deployed, on average, approximately 430.0 thousand horsepower out of a current estimated fleet of approximately 1.0 million horsepower.  In both our wireline and coiled tubing divisions, we deployed, on average, approximately 58 wireline trucks and 25 coiled tubing units out of current estimated fleets of approximately 130 trucks and 45 units, respectively.  However, not all of our assets are utilized fully, or at all, at any given time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime.  Additionally, in response to the continued challenging market conditions, we have implemented various operational rightsizing measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which has included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line. 
    
  Management evaluates our Completion Services segment's operational performance and allocates resources primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within this segment.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure computed as total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), net, net gain or loss on disposal of assets, acquisition-related costs, and non-routine items. 
    
    Third quarter     2016   revenue from our Completion Services segment was   $132.8 million  , representing approximately   57.1%   of our total revenue, with Adjusted EBITDA of   $(3.6) million  ; compared to $127.6 million of revenue and $(16.9) million of Adjusted EBITDA in the   second   quarter of 2016, and   $256.9 million   of revenue and   $(8.6) million   of Adjusted EBITDA in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
       
  Despite numerous lost job opportunities in the second quarter and at the beginning of the third quarter associated with concerns about our financial condition, announced restructuring and ultimate commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, both overall revenue and Adjusted EBITDA from our Completion Services segment benefited from higher overall utilization and modestly improved pricing levels in most core operating basins.  As commodity prices stabilized and the U.S. onshore rig count increased, many of our key customers in core operating basins accelerated completion activity resulting in increasing utilization levels throughout the quarter, and eventually slightly higher pricing levels within all of our core business lines by quarter end.  As certain customers began to accelerate the completion of drilled-but-uncompleted wells ("DUCs"), we strategically reallocated hydraulic fracturing resources to meet customer demand and to capture improving margin.  Despite the reduction of an additional frac fleet early in the quarter, the decrease in available frac days combined with improved completion job mix, allowed our Completions Services segment to experience improved financial performance sequentially.  In both our coiled tubing and wireline divisions, we experienced increases in utilization and slightly better pricing as completion activity increased throughout the third quarter.  Additionally, our coiled tubing and wireline operations benefited from increased workover and well maintenance activities. 
    
  Moving into the fourth quarter, we currently expect our Completion Services segment to continue to experience improved overall activity levels as many of our core customers continue to increase their rig count and accelerate DUC completion activity.  With that said, improving activity levels are dependent upon macroeconomic and commodity price stability.  Also, we continue to have conversations with our customers concerning the potential negative effect of seasonally decreased activity levels that are typical in the fourth quarter as capital budgets are exhausted and preparations commence for the new calendar year budgeting process.  In our hydraulic fracturing business, we continue to experience higher utilization due to improving activity levels; however, the environment continues to be highly competitive and margins remain pressured.  Additionally, if activity levels continue to increase and additional frac spreads return to work, we would expect improvement in our coiled tubing and wireline businesses, as DUC completion activity increases and more drilling rigs returning to the field to drill new wells that will eventually need our completion services.  We will continue to manage our businesses through these challenging market conditions, and we will continue our primary focus of meeting the needs of our customers in the safest, most cost efficient way possible, which we believe will best position the Company for future growth and success. 
  Well Support Services 
    
  Our Well Support Services segment, which was acquired in the Merger as part of the C P Business, consists of the following service lines: (1) rig services, including providing workover and well servicing rigs that are involved in routine repair and maintenance, completions, re-drilling and plug and abandonment operations; (2) fluid management services, including transportation, storage and disposal services for produced fluids and fluids used in the drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas wells; and (3) other special well site services.  Our rig services line is the greatest driver of revenue for this segment.   

-  53  - 

     Table of Contents  

During the third quarter of 2016, our Well Support Services segment deployed, on average, approximately 140 workover rigs per workday out of an estimated fleet of approximately 495 workover rigs.  In our fluid management service line, we deployed, on average, approximately 694 fluid services trucks per workday and approximately 1,286 frac tanks per workday out of estimated fleets of approximately 1,433 trucks and 5,229 tanks, respectively.  In our fluid management services line, we continued to utilize approximately 30 salt water disposal wells for fluids disposal purposes.  Keep in mind that not all of our assets are utilized fully, or at all, at any given time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime.  Additionally, in response to the continued challenging market conditions, we have implemented various operational rightsizing measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which has included idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line. 
    
  Management evaluates our Well Support Services segment operations  performance and allocates resources primarily based on activity levels, specifically rig and trucking hours, as well as Adjusted EBITDA. The following table presents rig and trucking hours, along with Adjusted EBITDA, for our Well Support Services segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and June 30, 2016 (dollars in millions): 

During the third quarter of 2016, both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially in our Well Support Services segment primarily due to higher activity levels that resulted in improved utilization throughout the quarter.  Despite higher activity levels, pricing remained extremely competitive across all service lines in most operational markets.  The commodity price stability experienced in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a renewed focus by our customer base to increase workover and well maintenance activity, which primarily enhanced the performance of our workover rig, P A and other specialty service lines.  Due to the sluggish nature of the overall recovery within the well service industry, we continued to support utilization and defend market share through pricing concessions in some of the most price competitive basins and further repositioned equipment and resources to areas with better market conditions and greater customer demand.  We also continued to exit select product lines in certain basins, close unprofitable facilities and further reduce head count, which helped enhance margins and profitability in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  As we exited the third quarter of 2016, activity levels continued to improve and pricing began to flatten as customers continued to spend more capital on workover and maintenance projects.  However, improving activity levels are dependent upon macroeconomic and commodity price stability.  Also, we continue to have conversations with our customers concerning the potential negative effect of seasonally decreased activity levels that are typical in our Well Support Services segment during the fourth quarter.  We will continue with our strategy of aggressive cost control and focusing on markets and customers that generate positive Adjusted EBITDA.  Our near-term strategy continues to focus on enhancing margins and profitability, properly managing capital spending levels and positioning the business to capitalize on opportunities as the market more meaningfully recovers. 
  Other Services 
  The Other Services segment is comprised of Legacy C J s smaller service lines and divisions, including equipment manufacturing and repair, Middle East operations, and research and technology, as well as the C P Business' cementing operations.  Our specialty chemical sales business, which we sold on June 29, 2016, was also included in this segment through the date of divestiture.  We manage several of our smaller businesses through our research and technology division, including our directional drilling services and products, our data acquisition and control instruments provider and our artificial lift applications provider.  Also included in the Other Services segment are intersegment eliminations and costs associated with activities of a general corporate nature. 
  
   -  54  - 

     Table of Contents  

Third quarter     2016   revenue from our Other Services segment was   $11.0 million   representing approximately   4.7%   of our total revenue, with Adjusted EBITDA of $  (22.1) million  ; compared to $11.7 million of revenue with $(21.4) million of Adjusted EBITDA in the   second   quarter of 2016, and   $19.7 million   of revenue with Adjusted EBITDA of $  (26.4) million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   
  Unlike the improvements witnessed in both our Completion Services and Well Support Services segments, most of the businesses comprising our Other Services Segment continue to be negatively impacted by the muted demand for those services driven by lower overall commodity prices.  Although the rig count has increased and commodity prices appear to be stabilizing, most customers are still hesitant to expand their capital budgets for additional services, which continues to negatively affect most of our business lines in this segment.  During the third quarter of 2016, we witnessed the most stability in our cementing business line as activity levels increased slightly in both our West Texas and Northeast operating basins.   
  In our Research   Technology division, we continue to supply more high-quality, low-cost perforating accessories to our casedhole wireline service line.  The delivery of perforating products and accessories to our internal wireline business has doubled since year-end 2015, and we currently estimate that we internally supply over a quarter of all direct expendables, which includes perforating guns, perforating accessories and addressable switches.   
  Through the third quarter of 2016, we continued to focus on rightsizing the businesses within our Other Services segment by scaling back or delaying certain planned initiatives and implementing additional rounds of cost reductions, including further reductions in head count and facilities and terminating certain non-essential initiatives.  As previously mentioned, in June 2016, we divested our specialty chemical sales business, and we will continue evaluating opportunities to potentially monetize additional non-core business lines in order to enhance our liquidity position. 

Operating Overview 
  Our results of operations are driven primarily by deviations in four interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services, which is driven by the level of demand for our services and equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of products and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; and (4) our activity, or  utilization  levels, and service performance. 
  Our operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling cost to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns.  We believe that the quality and efficiency of our service execution and aligning with customers who recognize the value that C J provides through efficiency gains are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business.  However, asset utilization is not necessarily indicative of our financial and/or operational performance and should not be given undue reliance.  Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle. 
  The Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is widely accepted and used as an indicator of overall E P company capital spending and resulting oilfield activity levels.  Historically, our utilization levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore spending by our E P company customers as a group.  Generally, as capital spending by E P companies increases, drilling, completion and production activity also increases, resulting in increased demand for our services, and therefore more days or hours worked (as the case may be).  Conversely, when drilling, completion and production activity levels decline due to lower spending by E P companies, we generally provide fewer services, which results in fewer days or hours worked (as the case may be).  Additionally, during periods of decreased spending by E P companies, we may be required to discount our rates or provide other pricing concessions to remain competitive and support utilization, which negatively impacts our revenue and operating margins.  During periods of pricing weakness for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, and our ability to achieve any cost reductions from our suppliers typically lags behind the decline in pricing for our services, which could further adversely affect our results.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
  Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within each segment and aids us in analytical comparisons for purposes of, among other things, efficiently allocating our assets and resources.  Our management team also monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand.  For our Completion Services operations, we measure our asset utilization levels primarily by the total

     Table of Contents  

number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month, which excludes scheduled maintenance days.  We generally consider an asset to be working such days that it is at or in transit to a job location, regardless of the number of hours worked or whether it generated any revenue during such time.  In our Well Support Services operations, we measure activity levels primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month.  However, given the variance in revenue and profitability from job to job, depending on the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed, asset utilization cannot be relied on as indicative of our financial or operating performance.  For additional information, see  Reportable Segments  in this Part I, Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Industry Trends and Outlook 
  We face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate.  Although many factors contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable.  In addition, while we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives, and consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Please read the factors described in the sections titled  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in Part I, Financial Information and  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report for additional information about the known material risks that we face. 
  General Industry Trends 
  The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and gas, current and expected future prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by E P companies to their drilling, completion and workover budgets.  The oil and gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, weather conditions, and other factors that are beyond our control.  Severe declines and sustained weakness and volatility in commodity prices over the course of 2015, and for most of 2016, and the consequent negative impact on the level of drilling, completion and production activity and capital expenditures by our customers, have adversely affected the demand for our services, and absent a significant rebound in commodity prices and corresponding increase in customer activity, are expected to adversely affect demand for our services in the future.  This, in turn, negatively impacts our ability to maintain utilization of assets and negotiate pricing at levels generating sufficient margins, especially in our hydraulic fracturing business. 
  Demand for our services tends to be extremely volatile and cyclical, as it is a direct function of our customers  willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Western Canada.  Our customers  willingness to undertake such activities and expenditures depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control, including, among other things, current and expected future levels of oil and gas prices and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and gas.  Oil and gas prices, and therefore the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by our customers, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile.  For example, during 2015 and in 2016 to date, oil prices reached and remained at their lowest levels since 2009, declining to as low as $26 per barrel.  Natural gas prices declined significantly in 2009 and have remained depressed relative to pre-2009 levels. 
    
  Declines or sustained weakness in oil and gas prices influences our customers to curtail their operations, reduce their capital expenditures, and request pricing concessions to reduce their operating costs.  The demand for drilling, completion and workover services is driven by available investment capital for such activities and in a lower oil and gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and gas producers decrease their activity and expenditures.   Because the type of services that we offer can be easily  started  and  stopped,  and oil and gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services compared with demand for other types of energy services.  A prolonged low level of customer activity, such as we have been experiencing over the last two years, adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Competition and Demand for Our Services 
  
   -  56  - 

     Table of Contents  

We operate in highly competitive areas of the oilfield services industry with significant potential for excess capacity.  Completion and well servicing equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area.  Additionally, the demand for our services depends primarily on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling, completion and production activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices and numerous other factors over which we have no control.  Utilization and pricing for our services have in the past been negatively affected by increases in supply relative to demand in our core operating areas and geographic markets.  
  Our revenues and earnings are directly affected by changes in utilization and pricing levels for our services, which fluctuate in response to changes in the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by our customers.  Pressure on pricing for our core services, including due to competition and industry and/or economic conditions, may impact, among other things, our ability to maintain utilization and pricing for our services or implement price increases.  During periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our results.   Furthermore, even when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset any rising costs.  Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our utilization levels.  The inability to maintain our utilization and pricing levels, or to increase our prices as costs increase, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
    
  Our competitors include many large and small energy service companies, including some of the largest integrated energy services companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.  Our larger competitors  greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can, including by reducing prices for services.  Our major competitors for our Completion Services include Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, CalFrac Well Services, Keane, Weatherford International, RPC, Inc., Pumpco, a subsidiary of Superior Energy Services, Frac Tech, and Basic Energy Services, as well as a significant number of regional businesses.  Our major competitors for our Well Support Services include Key Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Precision, Forbes, Pioneer Energy Services, as well as a significant number of regional businesses. 
    
  Generally, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets that we serve are price, technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force capability, safety record, reputation and experience.  Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded work, particularly during times of weak commodity prices like we have experienced from late 2014 to date.  As this downturn has continued, our customer base has demonstrated a more intense focus on receiving the lowest service cost pricing possible.  Additionally, projects for certain of our core service lines are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to further increase competition based primarily on price.  Over the last several quarters, our utilization and pricing levels have been negatively impacted by predatory pricing from certain large competitors, who have elected to operate at negative margins.  During healthier market conditions, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on the safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services, although even then we must be competitive in our pricing.  We seek to differentiate ourselves from our major competitors by our operating philosophy, which is focused on delivering the highest quality customer service and equipment, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency.  As part of this strategy, we target high volume, high efficiency customers with service intensive, 24-hour work, which is where we believe we can differentiate our services from our competitors. 
    
  Current Market Conditions and Outlook 
    
  The course of 2016 to date has been, on many levels, one of the most difficult and challenging periods in C J s history.  As we entered 2016, we experienced a severe slowdown in activity across our customer base as operators reacted to the further declines in oil prices and the continuing fall in rig count by delaying or canceling previously scheduled work, resulting in significantly decreased utilization levels across our services lines and operating areas.  The significant, negative impact to our first quarter results resulted in the Covenant Default under our Credit Agreement, and ultimately led to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding discussed under  Recent Developments   Other Matters - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Restructuring Support Agreement  in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. 
       
  The severely challenging market conditions experienced through 2016 to date began to slightly alleviate towards the latter part of the third quarter as commodity prices appeared to be stabilizing and customers began putting more drilling rigs back to work.  In our Completion Services segment, we experienced increasing utilization levels as customers accelerated completion activity to take advantage of slightly higher commodity prices.  In some cases, we were able to increase pricing slightly within some of our core service lines due to a lack of available service capacity in select core operating basins.  In our Well Support Services segment, customers began to allocate more capital towards well maintenance and workover activities as commodity prices stabilized, which particularly enhanced the financial performance of our workover rig, P A and other  
  
   -  57  - 

     Table of Contents  

specialty services business lines.  Despite the increased activity levels during the third quarter, the operating environment remains challenging, and we continue to evaluate alternatives to further rightsize our business lines with current market conditions. 
    
  Despite improving market conditions throughout the quarter, our third quarter results were negatively impacted by customer reaction to our July 2016 commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, which resulted in numerous lost job opportunities, particularly in our hydraulic fracturing business line, as certain customers simply preferred to work with service providers with less financial uncertainty.  We also experienced a similar customer reaction in the second quarter, following our May 2016 announcement of credit facility default and the need to undertake a financial restructuring. We focused on alleviating customer concerns through continuous, transparent and multi-faceted communication, and have been successful in retaining certain core work and customer relationships in spite of significant headwinds.  We have undertaken the same outreach exercise with respect to our vendors in order to preserve critical relationships.  
  As we moved into the fourth quarter, market conditions have continued to stabilize, and in most of our core service lines, we believe that activity levels should continue to improve as customers increase capital spending.  We continue to have conversations with our customers about the potential negative impacts that the typical fourth quarter seasonality could have on our quarterly results.  At this point, we are unable to quantify the magnitude of the potential fourth quarter seasonal slowdown.  Despite typical fourth quarter seasonality, we are hopeful that higher activity levels combined with cost control and rightsizing measures that we have implemented will continue to result in improved financial performance in the fourth quarter and beyond.  Despite the improved financial performance in the third quarter, we continue to manage against an overall lack of visibility beyond the forward month, and a customer base that is highly reactive to the volatile commodity pricing environment and intensely focused on receiving the lowest possible service cost.  We will continue to focus on providing high quality oilfield services to all of our customers in the safest, most efficient manner possible, and our continued efforts in that regard have solidified our position as one of the top service providers in each of our core service lines.  Additionally, we have maintained the integrity of our organization, including a solid asset base and experienced management team, which is essential to the future growth of our Company.  We are cautiously optimistic that the commodity price recovery will continue to unfold as we move into 2017, which should lead to higher activity levels and allow us to enter additional oilfield equipment back into service with core customers in the first half of next year.  Absent a continued recovery in commodity prices, we would expect that activity and pricing levels will remain challenged, which could continue to strain our financial and operating results.  The ultimate impact of the current industry downturn on our company will depend upon various factors, many of which remain beyond our control.  
  We are actively monitoring the market and managing our business in line with demand for services, and we will make adjustments as necessary to effectively respond to the challenging conditions.  Our top priorities remain to drive revenue by maximizing utilization, improve margins through cost controls, protect and grow market share by focusing on the quality and efficiency of our service execution and ensure we are strategically positioned to capitalize on future market improvement.

Results of Operations 
  The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   include the financial and operating results of both Legacy C J and the C P Business for the entire period.  Results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   include the financial and operating results of Legacy C J for the entire period and the C P Business for the period from the Effective Time of the Merger through   September 30, 2015  .  Results for the period prior to March 24, 2015 reflect the financial and operating results of Legacy C J exclusively, and do not include the financial and operating results of the C P Business.  Accordingly, comparisons of our results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the comparable prior year period may not be meaningful.  
  Results for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following table summarizes the change in our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (in thousands):

Revenue 
  Revenue   decreased     $195.0 million  , or   45.6%  , to   $232.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $427.5 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease in revenue was primarily due to (i) a decrease of   $124.1 million   in our Completion Services segment as a result of significantly lower utilization and pricing levels across our Completion Services segment caused by the extremely competitive market environment given the persistence of depressed levels of U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity (ii) a   decrease   of   $62.1 million   in our Well Support Services segment as a result of unprecedented reduced levels of customer activity during the first half of 2016 in areas that typically maintain moderate levels of well support services activity and (iii) a   decrease   of   $8.8 million   in our Other Services segment as a result of continued weak demand for our services driven by the persistently low commodity prices characterizing this severe, prolonged industry downturn. 
    
  Direct Costs 
  Direct costs   decreased     $169.0 million  , or   43.8%  , to   $216.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $385.9 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease in direct costs was primarily due to the corresponding decrease in revenue which was negatively impacted by overall lower utilization across our Completion Services and Well Support Services segments resulting from the extremely competitive market environment caused by the persistence of

     Table of Contents  

depressed levels of U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity and well support services activity.  As utilization fell in our Completion Services segment, we strategically stacked additional equipment, closed unprofitable facilities, reduced head count and aggressively cut costs in order to further lower our operational cost structure.  Similarly, in our Well Support Services segment, we exited select product lines in certain basins, closed unprofitable facilities and further reduced head count.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG A ) and Research and Development Expense ( R D ) 
  SG A   decreased     $12.2 million  , or   19.9%  , to   $48.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $61.0 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The   decrease   in SG A was primarily due to $11.2 million reduction in employee related costs as a result of headcount reductions, $2.6 million reduction in share based compensation, $5.0 million decrease in acquisition-related costs and $1.7 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses as a result of cost cutting initiatives.  These amounts were partially offset by $8.3 million in costs related to our restructuring activities as a result of entering into Chapter 11 proceedings.   
  We also incurred   $1.8 million   in R D for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $4.9 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease in R D was primarily due to our cost control initiatives, which included scaling back our research and technology division and initiatives and delaying certain projects.  Currently, we are limiting our investments to those key technologies that are providing our businesses with a competitive advantage by enhancing our operational capabilities and reducing our overall cost structure.   
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense ( D A ) 
  D A   decreased     $23.4 million  , or   31.3%  , to   $51.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $74.7 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The   decrease   in D A was primarily the result of significant impairment charges recorded during 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to the steep decline in asset utilization levels related to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry.   
  Impairment Expense 
    
  Due to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry, and the resulting sustained weakness in demand for our services, we determined that it was necessary to test goodwill for impairment and to test property, plant and equipment ("PP E") and other intangible assets for recoverability during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and again during the first three quarters of 2016.  Recoverability testing resulted in no impairment of the PP E or other intangible assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the value of such assets was recoverable.  
    
  Impairment expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $394.2 million   and consisted of $380.4 million of goodwill impairment related to the Completion Services and Other Services reporting units and $13.8 million related to other intangible assets.    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $8.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which   decreased     $20.2 million   from   $28.4 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease is primarily due to the Company's Chapter 11 Proceeding.  Interest expense incurred subsequent to our Chapter 11 filing is recognized only to the extent that it will be paid during the cases or that it is probable that it will be an allowed claim.  As a result, we did not accrue interest that we believe is not probable of being treated as an allowed claim in the Chapter 11 Proceeding.     
  Reorganization Items       
  Reorganization items of $40.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are primarily related to professional fees of $21.5 million and contract termination settlements of $19.5 million, slightly offset by $0.1 million in vendor claims adjustments in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings.  
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded a tax benefit of   $21.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , at an effective rate of   16.6%  , compared to a tax benefit of   $69.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , at an effective rate of   13.2%  .  The   increase   in the effective tax rate was primarily due to impairment charges that were not deductible for tax in the prior year.

Results for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following table summarizes the change in our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (in thousands): 

Revenue 
  Revenue   decreased     $612.6 million  , or   45.7%  , to   $727.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $1.3 billion   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease  was primarily due to a decrease of   $537.4 million   in revenue in our Completion Services segment as a result of significantly lower utilization and pricing levels across our Completion Services segment caused by the extremely competitive market environment given the decline in, and persistence of depressed levels of, U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity, partially offset by the fact that revenue for the corresponding prior year period only included C P Business Completion Services revenue from the Effective Time of the Merger to September 30, 2015.  The decrease in revenue in our Well Support Services segment was primarily due to a decrease of   $50.0 million   as a result of the unprecedented reduced levels of customer activity during the first three quarters of 2016 in areas that typically maintain moderate levels of well support services activity, partially offset by the fact that revenue for the corresponding prior year period only included C P Business Well Support Services revenue from the Effective Time of the

     Table of Contents  

Merger to September 30, 2015.  The decrease in our Other Services segment was primarily due to a   decrease   of   $25.2 million   as a result of continued weak demand for our services driven by the low commodity prices characterizing this severe, prolonged industry downturn. 
    
  Direct Costs 
  Direct costs   decreased     $443.1 million  , or   38.5%  , to   $708.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.2 billion   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease in direct costs was primarily due to the corresponding decrease in revenue which was negatively impacted by overall lower utilization levels across our Completion Services and Well Support Services segments resulting from the extremely competitive market environment caused by the continued decline in U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity as well as the unprecedented slowdown in well support services activity, and partially offset by the shorter period for the C P Business from the Effective Time of the Merger to September 30, 2015, as noted above.  As utilization fell in our Completion Services segment, we strategically stacked additional equipment, closed unprofitable facilities, reduced head count and aggressively cut costs in order to further lower our operational cost structure.  Similarly, in our Well Support Services segment, we exited select product lines in certain basins, closed unprofitable facilities and further reduced head count.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG A ) and Research and Development Expense ( R D ) 
  SG A   decreased     $6.2 million  , or   3.3%  , to   $182.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $188.4 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The   decrease   in SG A was primarily due to a $30.1 million decrease in acquisition-related cost and a $6.9 million decrease in employee related costs as a result of headcount reductions.  These amounts are partially offset by $23.7 million in costs related to our restructuring activities as a result of the debt covenant violation and the Chapter 11 proceedings, $1.9 million increase in stock based compensation and the shorter period for the C P Business from the Effective Time of the Merger to September 30, 2015, as noted above. 
  We also incurred   $6.0 million   in R D for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $13.3 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The decrease in R D was primarily due to our cost control initiatives, which included scaling back our research and technology division and initiatives and delaying certain projects.  Currently, we are limiting our investments to those key technologies that are providing our businesses with a competitive advantage by enhancing our operational capabilities and reducing our overall cost structure.   
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense ( D A ) 
  D A   decreased     $29.1 million  , or   15.0%  , to   $164.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $193.7 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The   decrease   in D A was primarily the result of significant impairment charges recorded during 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to the steep decline in asset utilization levels related to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry.   
  Impairment Expense 
       
  Due to the continued downturn in the oil and gas industry, and the resulting sustained weakness in demand for our services, we determined that it was necessary to test goodwill for impairment and to test PP E and other intangible assets for recoverability during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and again during the first three quarters of 2016.  Based on our assessment, we recorded impairment expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $430.4 million  , consisting of   $314.3 million   of goodwill impairment related to impairment of all remaining goodwill associated with our Well Support Services segment, along with   $55.0 million   related to other intangible assets and $61.1 million related to PP E within each of our Completion Services and Other Services segments.   
    
  Impairment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $394.2 million and consisted of $380.4 million of goodwill impairment related to the Completion Services and Other Services reporting units and $13.8 million related to other intangible assets.  
  Reorganization Items       
  Reorganization items of $40.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are primarily related to professional fees of $21.5 million and contract termination settlements of $19.5 million, slightly offset by $0.1 million in vendor claims adjustments in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings.

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $155.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which   increased     $98.1 million   from   $57.4 million   for the corresponding prior year period.  The increase is primarily due to $91.9 million of accelerated amortization of original issue discount and deferred financing costs, fully amortizing these amounts as of June 30, 2016 as a result of the Restructuring Support Agreement which contemplates the implementation of a restructuring of the Company through a debt-to-equity conversion and equity rights offering, and due to $10 million primarily related to higher levels of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities, partially offset by a reduction of $4.0 million of amortization of deferred financing costs. 
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded a tax benefit of   $126.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , at an effective rate of   13.3%  , compared to a tax benefit of   $108.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , at an effective rate of   16.5%  .  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate was primarily due to valuation allowances applied against certain deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and impairment charges that were not deductible for tax.

  Sustained low utilization and pricing levels due to the ongoing industry downturn have had a material, negative impact on our operational and financial performance.  We incurred a net loss of   $825.9 million   for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016, with   $83.3 million   of negative Adjusted EBITDA for that period.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a cash balance of approximately   $101.4 million  , and $75.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our DIP Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowings totaling $25.0 million associated with the DIP Facility, all of which is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  We used   $82.7 million   of cash from operations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Please see  Financial Condition and Cash Flows  below for information about net cash provided by or used in our operating, investing and financing activities.  Capital expenditures totaled $8.2 million during the   third   quarter of   2016  , primarily relating to maintenance that extends the useful life of our existing equipment, compared to $17.8 million during the   second   quarter of 2016 and $18.6 million during the first quarter of 2016.  In response to persistently challenging industry conditions, we significantly scaled back our   2016   capital expenditure plan and have primarily limited it to the maintenance of our active equipment.  We currently expect 2016 capital expenditures to total between $60 million and $70 million, compared to $166.3 million in 2015. 
  In May 2016, we announced the Covenant Default under our Credit Agreement and that we had initiated a process to resolve this matter with the lenders under the Credit Agreement and to explore strategic alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet and maximize the value of the Company.  As a result of our efforts, on July 20, 2016, we commenced the Chapter 11 Proceeding, which accelerated our obligations under the Credit Agreement.   
  As part of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, on July 29, 2016, we entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, providing for the $100 million DIP Facility that is intended to provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to fund the administration of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Debtors  entry into the 
  DIP Facility on a final basis.  We believe that our current cash balance, along with the additional financing under the DIP Facility, will provide us with sufficient resources to support our businesses and continue our operations in ordinary course through the Chapter 11 Proceeding.   
  The significant risks and uncertainties related to depressed market conditions, our liquidity and our ongoing Chapter 11 Proceeding raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported income and expenses could be required and could be material.  Please see Note 3 - Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, improvements in market conditions and our ability to improve profitability, our ability to meet certain conditions of the Restructuring Support Agreement and

obtain confirmation of the Restructuring Plan or another Chapter 11 plan by the Bankruptcy Court, and our ability to successfully implement the Restructuring Plan or another Chapter 11 plan.  Please see  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of potential risks associated with the Chapter 11 Proceeding. 
    
  Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity have historically included cash flows from operations and borrowings under senior secured debt facilities, including our Revolver.   However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and are highly dependent on the drilling, completion and production activity by our customers, which in turn is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. 
  Following the determination of the Covenant Violation in May 2016, our principal source of liquidity has been limited to cash on hand.  As part of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, on July 29, 2016, we entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, providing the $100 million DIP Facility that is intended to provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to fund the administration of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility on a final basis.  For additional information about the Chapter 11 Proceeding, please see "Recent Developments   Other Matters - Commencement of Chapter 11 Proceeding and Restructuring Support Agreement" in Part I, Item 2; Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Note 3   Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  and  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. 
  As we move through the Chapter 11 Proceeding, our focus is on preserving liquidity by lowering our operating expenses, controlling costs, minimizing capital expenditures and maximizing collection of receivables.  Our operating cash flow is likely to continue to be negatively impacted due to the current prolonged downturn in the oil and gas industry.  In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred and continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs in connection with the administration of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs for the pendency of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  
  Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through the Chapter 11 Proceeding and beyond depends on our ability to successfully implement the Restructuring Plan (or another Chapter 11 plan), successful operation of our business, and appropriate management of operating expenses and capital spending.  Although we believe that the DIP Facility together with cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet the operating costs of our existing business, there are no assurances that such will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations or to allow us to continue as a going concern until the Restructuring Plan (or another Chapter 11 plan) is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or some other alternative restructuring transaction is approved by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated.  We are required to repay all amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility on the Effective Date of emergence of Chapter 11, and we intend to use the proceeds from the $200.0 million Rights Offering to repay such amounts. 
  As a result of the debt-to-equity conversion feature of the Restructuring Plan, we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Proceeding substantially debt free.  We are evaluating various financing options for our reorganized Company following emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  We expect to enter into a senior secured revolving asset-based lending credit facility in a minimum amount of $100 million, subject to the Backstop Parties and certain other Supporting Lenders agreeing that such financing facility is in the best interest of our Company. 
  Our long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of our capital resources and our ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until a Chapter 11 plan has been confirmed, if at all, by the Bankruptcy Court.  If our future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and be unable to continue as a going concern and will likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement further cost reductions, seek other financing alternatives or seek the sale of some or all of our assets.  If we are unable to meet our liquidity needs, we may have to take other actions to seek additional financing to the extent available or we could be forced to consider other alternatives to maximize potential recovery for the creditors, including possible sale of the Company or certain material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
  Liquidity Outlook and Future Capital Requirements 
  The energy services business is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, upgrade and purchase equipment to meet our customers  needs and industry demand.  To date, our capital requirements have consisted primarily of, and we anticipate, over the long-term, will continue to be: 

-  64  - 

     Table of Contents  

growth capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to acquire additional equipment and other assets, increase our service lines, expand geographically or advance other strategic initiatives for the purpose of growing our business; and 
                
    capital expenditures related to our existing equipment, such as maintenance and other activities to extend the useful life of partially or fully depreciated assets.     
       
  The successful execution of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows and/or raise additional capital as needed.  Historically, we have been able to generate cash flows and our free cash flow and balance sheet have allowed us to be flexible with our approach to organic growth and acquisition opportunities.  
    
  Throughout 2015, we experienced a sustained slowdown in activity across our customer base as operators reacted to the rapid decline in commodity prices that began during the fourth quarter of 2014.  This resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure across our service lines and operating areas.  Customers rapidly began reducing their budgets and slashing drilling and completion activity.  Through most of 2016, activity levels across our industry (including our own activity levels) have been severely depressed.  Our financial and operating performance for the first three quarters of 2016 was materially and negatively impacted by the severe reduction in demand for our services, with reductions in customer budgets and drilling and completion activity driving severe utilization declines and pricing pressure.  Late in the third quarter, we began to experience some slight improvement in market condition, due to more stable commodity pricing with some increase in rig count, which ultimately resulted in improved operational and financial performance.  Despite the improving market conditions, we remain concerned about the potential negative effect of seasonally decreased activity levels that are typical in the fourth quarter as capital budgets are exhausted and preparations commence for the new calendar year budgeting process.  Although we are optimistic that activity levels will continue to improve with additional commodity pricing stability, the ultimate severity and duration of this downturn remains uncertain and absent a continued recovery in commodity prices, we would expect activity and pricing levels to remain challenged, which could continue to negatively impact our financial and operating results over the near term.  
    
  As noted above, our immediate liquidity is greatly threatened as a result of the Chapter 11 Proceeding and by our reduced cash flow from operations.  If we are unable to finance our operations on acceptable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.  For additional discussion of the known, material risks associated with the Chapter 11 Proceeding and available financing options, please see  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. 
    
  Although our financial results during the current industry downturn have been disappointing, we believe that we have built a strong platform that will enable us to perform at the highest level when the market recovers.  With respect to our strategic initiatives, we believe that the strategic investments in vertical integration and our research and technology capabilities that we have made, and our efforts to lower our cost base for key inputs and improve our operational capabilities and efficiencies, will help us manage through this down-cycle.  Several of our research and technology initiatives have contributed in helping to generate monthly cost savings to our Completion Services operations and are also helping to generate revenue.   Although the financial benefits are still minimal at this time, we believe that these strategic projects will deliver meaningful cost savings to us over the long term.  However, given the magnitude of this current industry downturn which has resulted in reduced demand for our services, we are adjusting our business strategy as necessary to effectively respond to the market, including the delay of further investment in certain research and technology projects, and to take the necessary steps to further protect and maximize the value of our Company. 
    
  Financial Condition and Cash Flows 
  The net cash provided by or used in our operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below (in thousands): 

-  65  - 

     Table of Contents  

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash from operating activities   decreased   $  185.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in operating cash flow was primarily due to (i) the increase in net loss during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , after excluding the effects of changes in noncash items and (ii) the decline in cash collections of accounts receivable due to higher collection levels during the second and third quarters of 2015 from accounts acquired as part of the Merger, partially offset by positive changes in operating assets and liabilities which included (i) a decrease in the use of cash to satisfy obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to higher disbursement levels during the second and third quarters of 2015 from trade payables acquired in connection with the Merger and (ii) a decrease in the use of cash related to accounts payable and lower cash interest payments during the third quarter of 2016 both resulting from the automatic stay associated with the Bankruptcy Petitions.   
    
  Cash Used in Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities   decreased     $786.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  .  This   decrease   was primarily due to the cash consideration of $693.6 million paid at the closing of the Merger for the acquisition of the C P Business during the first quarter of 2015 as well as a decline in capital expenditure purchases as a result of the sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry, partially offset by a $43.4 million purchase price reduction for the C P Business related to a working capital adjustment during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities   decreased     $534.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  .  The   decrease   is primarily related to proceeds received from our Credit Agreement to fund the cash consideration portion of the acquisition of the C P Business at the closing of the Merger, partially offset by the payoff of the long-term debt of Legacy C J, both during the first quarter of 2015. 
    
  Description of our Indebtedness 
  Debtor-in-Possession $100 Million Term Loan Facility 
  Under the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the DIP Lenders agreed to fund the $100 million DIP Facility.  The DIP Facility is intended to provide the Debtors with sufficient liquidity to fund the administration of the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  The Debtors  are able to access funds under the DIP Facility only if authorized to do so by the Bankruptcy Court.  As of September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court has approved the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility on both an interim and final basis.   
  On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into the  DIP Credit Agreement, which sets forth the terms and conditions of the DIP Facility. 
  The borrowers under the DIP Facility are the Company and CJ Holding Co.  All obligations under the DIP Facility are guaranteed by the Company s subsidiaries that are debtors in the Bankruptcy cases.  Borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement are generally secured by superpriority priming liens on substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and guarantors. 
  The DIP Facility is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2017, however the maturity thereof may be accelerated upon the occurrence of various events, including our failure to satisfy any of the Milestones described above.  Borrowings under the DIP Facility are non-amortizing. 
  
   -  66  - 

     Table of Contents  

Amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility bear interest based on, at the option of the borrower, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to 9.00% in the case of LIBOR loans and 8.00% in the case of base rate loans.  The alternative base rate is equal to the highest of (i) the published  prime rate , (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0%. 
  The DIP Facility also requires that the Company pay various fees to the DIP Lenders, including a commitment fee equal to 5.00% of the unused commitments thereunder. 
  The DIP Facility may be prepaid from time to time without premium or penalty, except for a 2.00% prepayment penalty payable in the event the DIP facility is refinanced or replaced with the proceeds of another financing during the pendency of the Bankruptcy cases. 
  The DIP Facility is required to be prepaid under particular circumstances, including (i) in the event of a sale or other disposition of property by C J or its subsidiaries, in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, subject to customary reinvestment rights and other exceptions, and (ii) in the event of an incurrence of debt not permitted under the DIP Credit Agreement, in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of such debt. 
  We are required under the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement to deliver periodic 13-week budgets.  The DIP Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring our actual receipts and expenditures to remain within a certain variance of the amounts set forth in such budgets. 
  The DIP Credit Agreement also contains customary restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to exceptions) that limit, among other things, our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures and prepay certain indebtedness.  The activities of our subsidiaries that are not debtors in the Bankruptcy cases are extremely limited pursuant to the DIP Credit Agreement. 
  Continued access to the DIP Facility is dependent upon the Debtors  compliance with various covenants, including certain milestones.  On July 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order (the  Interim DIP Order ) approving the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility.  Under the terms of the Interim DIP Order, the Debtors were authorized to access $25 million in funding under the DIP Facility, and on July 29, 2016, the Company accessed $25 million under the DIP Facility.  As described above, the Debtors were not authorized to access the remaining $75 million provided under the DIP Facility until and unless the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order approving the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility on a final basis.  On September 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order (the  Final DIP Order ) authorizing the Debtors  entry into the DIP Facility. In addition to approving the terms of the DIP Facility described above, the Final DIP Order contains a number of significant provisions, including:  
     stipulations regarding amounts owed to and potential claims against the Lenders; 
     provisions providing the DIP Lenders with superpriority administrative expense claims pursuant to section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; 
     provisions providing the DIP Lenders with replacement liens on any of the Debtors  unencumbered assets and junior and senior liens on certain of the Debtors  encumbered assets pursuant to section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; 
     waiver of the automatic stay of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code and certain other rights under the Bankruptcy Code, including the protections of sections 506(c) and 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code; and 
     provisions providing for  adequate protection  in exchange for consensual use of the Lenders  collateral, including cash collateral, which protections include replacement liens and superpriority administrative expense claims to the extent of any diminution in the value of the Lenders  collateral, the payment of certain professionals  fees, compliance with the Milestones, and certain reporting obligations. 
  Absent access to the DIP Facility, or other similar financing, there is a risk that the Debtors may not be able to fund the administration of their Chapter 11 Proceeding and ongoing operations. 
  Description of the Credit Agreement 
  In connection with the closing of the Merger, we entered into a new credit agreement, dated as of March 24, 2015 (the  Original Credit Agreement ), among C J, CJ Lux Holdings S.  r.l. ( Luxco ), CJ Holding Co, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the  Administrative Agent ), Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. The Original Credit Agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the "Credit Facilities") in an aggregate principal amount of $1.66 billion, consisting of (a) a $600.0 million revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility" or "Revolver") and (b) a Term Loan B Facility in the aggregate principal amount of   $1.06 billion  , comprised of two tranches: (i) a tranche consisting of   $575.0 million   in original aggregate principal amount of term loans  
  
   -  67  - 

     Table of Contents  

maturing on March 24, 2020 (the  Five-Year Term Loans ) and (ii) a tranche consisting of a   $485.0 million   in original aggregate principal amount of term loans maturing on March 24, 2022 (the  Seven-Year Term Loans ).  
  On September 29, 2015, we entered into a waiver and second amendment (the "Waiver and Second Amendment") and a third amendment (the "Third Amendment" and, together with the Waiver and Second Amendment, the "Amendments") to the Original Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendments, the "Amended Credit Agreement" or the "Credit Agreement").  The Waiver and Second Amendment, among other things, suspended the covenants related to the quarterly Total Leverage Ratio (as defined below), a quarterly ratio of consolidated EBITDA of C J and its subsidiaries to consolidated interest expense of C J and its subsidiaries, and other covenants set forth in the Original Credit Agreement commencing with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 and running through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017.   The Waiver and Second Amendment also provided for new financial covenants that apply in lieu of the quarterly Total Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio previously in effect, including the following: 
     a quarterly minimum EBITDA covenant, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and running through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, based on a negotiated EBITDA test (the "Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant"); and 
     a quarterly limitation on capital expenditures for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and annual limitations on capital expenditures for the four fiscal quarter periods ending December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2017. 
  The borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility were C J, Luxco and CJ Holding Co. The borrower under the Term Loan B Facility was CJ Holding Co. All obligations under the Credit Agreement were guaranteed by the Company s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries. 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were scheduled to mature on March 24, 2020 (except that if any Five-Year Term Loans had not been repaid prior to September 24, 2019, the Revolving Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on September 24, 2019). 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were non-amortizing.  The Term Loan B Facility required the borrower thereunder to make quarterly amortization payments in an amount equal to   1.0%   per annum, with the remaining balance payable on the applicable maturity date. 
  Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest based on, at the option of the borrower, the LIBOR or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin based on the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness of C J and its subsidiaries to consolidated EBITDA of C J and its subsidiaries for the most recent four fiscal quarter period for which financial statements are available (the  Total Leverage Ratio ). The Revolving Credit Facility also required that the borrowers pay a commitment fee equal to a percentage of unused commitments which varied based on the Total Leverage Ratio. 
  Five-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bore interest based on, at the option of the borrower, LIBOR (which, in the case of the Term Loan B Facility, was deemed to be no less than   1.0%   per annum), plus a margin of   5.5%  , or an alternative base rate, plus a margin of   4.5%  .  Seven-Year Term Loans outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility bore interest based on, at the option of the borrower, LIBOR (which, in the case of the Term Loan B Facility, will be deemed to be no less than   1.0%   per annum), plus a margin of   6.25%  , or an alternative base rate, plus a margin of   5.25%  .  The Term Loan B Facility also contained  most favored nation  pricing protection requiring that if the effective yield (giving effect to, among other things, consent fees paid to the lenders) of the Five-Year Term Loans increased by more than 50 basis points, the effective yield of the Seven-Year Term Loans must increase by the same amount less 50 basis points. 
  The alternative base rate was equal to the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and (iii) LIBOR plus   1.0%  .  
  Subject to certain conditions and limitations, the Credit Agreement permitted the borrowers to increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in a total principal amount of up to   $100.0 million  . 
  The Revolving Credit Facility was permitted to be prepaid from time to time without premium or penalty. Five-Year Term Loans were subject to a prepayment premium of   4%   for any voluntary prepayments made on or prior to March 24, 2016 and no prepayment premium thereafter.  Seven-Year Term Loans were subject to a prepayment premium of   5%   for any voluntary prepayments made on or prior to March 24, 2017 and no prepayment premium thereafter. 
  Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Term Loan B Facility was required to be prepaid under particular circumstances, including (i) in the event that C J and its subsidiaries generate Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in any fiscal year, in an amount equal to   50%   of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year is   3.25  :  1.00   or greater, (ii) in the event of a sale or other disposition of property by C J or its subsidiaries, in an amount equal to   100%   of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, subject to customary  
  
   -  68  - 

     Table of Contents  

reinvestment rights and other exceptions, and (iii) in the event of an incurrence of debt not permitted under the Credit Agreement, in an amount equal to   100%   of the net proceeds of such debt. 
  The Credit Agreement contained customary restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to exceptions) that limited, among other things, our ability to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens or indebtedness, sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, make certain restricted payments and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures and prepay certain indebtedness. 
  During the first half of 2016, utilization and commodity price levels continued to fall towards unprecedented levels which negatively impacted our results of operations and caused us to fall out of compliance with the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant measured as of March 31, 2016, which is considered an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement.  On May 10, 2016, we obtained a temporary limited waiver agreement from certain of the lenders in respect of this covenant violation from March 31, 2016 through May 31, 2016, wherein such lenders have agreed to not consider the covenant violation an event of default through May 31, 2016.  
  On May 31, 2016, the Company obtained a forbearance agreement (the  Forbearance Agreement ) from certain of the lenders pursuant to which, among other things, such lenders agreed not to pursue default remedies against the Company with respect to its breach of the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant or certain specified payment defaults.  On June 30, 2016, this forbearance was extended through July 17, 2016 pursuant to a second forbearance agreement (the  Second Forbearance Agreement ), and prior to such termination this forbearance period was once again extended through July 20, 2016.  At the end of this forbearance period the Company filed the Bankruptcy Court petitions described above as contemplated by the terms of the Second Forbearance Agreement. 

Other Matters 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Other than as disclosed in Note 3 - Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 did not change materially from those disclosed in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  Specifically, the Company s Restructuring Plan contemplates that approximately $1.3 billion of debt outstanding under the Company s Credit Agreement would be converted into equity, and as of September 30, 2016, such debt, as well as the contractual interest payment obligations that would have been required under the Credit Agreement, is classified as liabilities subject to compromise.  
  Notwithstanding the above, under the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.  Generally, the assumption of a contract will require that we satisfy any pre-petition obligations under the contract, which may include payment of pre-petition liabilities in whole or in part.  The assumption of a contract may also result in amendments to its terms. Rejection of a contract is typically treated as a breach occurring as of the moment immediately preceding the Petition Date.  The disclosures in this Quarterly Report do not reflect all potential changes to our contractual obligations and other commitments that may result from the Chapter 11 Proceeding and activities contemplated by the Restructuring Plan. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a) (4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.   In August 201  5, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2015-14")  ,   which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year and is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.  ASU 2015-14 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  We are   currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position.

     Table of Contents  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, S  implifying the Measurement of Inventory   ("ASU 2015-11"), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is part of the FASB s simplification initiative and applies to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out ("LIFO") or the retail inventory method. The guidance will require prospective application at the beginning of our first q  uarter of fiscal 2018, but permits adoption in an earlier period.  We do not   expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. We are required to adopt this ASU for years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and the guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01").  ASU 2016-01 improves upon U.S. GAAP by, among other things, (1) requiring equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (3) eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and (4) clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  We are required to adopt this ASU for years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU No. 2016-02 seeks to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and by disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Unlike current U.S. GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, ASU No. 2016-02 will require both operating and finance leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Additionally, the new guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"), to simplify certain provisions in stock compensation accounting, including the simplification of accounting for a stock payment's tax consequences.  The ASU amends the guidance for classifying awards as either equity or liabilities, allows companies to estimate the number of stock awards they expect to vest, and revises the tax withholding requirements for stock awards.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12"), to clarify in the FASB's revenue recognition standard the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract, the guidance for presenting sales taxes and similar taxes, and the timing for measuring customer payments that are not in cash.  We do   not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends U.S. GAAP by introducing a new impairment model for financial instruments that is based on expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses. The new impairment model applies to most financial assets, including trade accounts receivable. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although it may be adopted one year earlier, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash receipts and Cash Payments:  A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force   ("ASU 2016-15"), which makes target changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ("ASU 2016-16"), which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than an intra-entity asset transfer of inventory, when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our results of operations and financial position.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. 
  No changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  I  TEM   1. L  EGAL   P  ROCEEDINGS 
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims incidental to or arising in the ordinary course of our business. Our management does not expect the outcome in any of these known legal proceedings, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Shareholder Litigation relating to the Merger  
    
  In July 2014, following the announcement that Legacy C J, Nabors, and New C J had entered into the Merger Agreement, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a purported shareholder of Legacy C J challenging the Merger. The lawsuit is styled   City of Miami General Employees  and Sanitation Employees  Retirement Trust, et al. ( Plaintiff ) v. Comstock, et al.; C.A. No. 9980-CB  , in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, filed on July 30, 2014 (the  Shareholder Litigation ). Plaintiff in the Shareholder Litigation generally alleges that the board of directors for Legacy C J breached fiduciary duties of loyalty, due care, good faith, candor and independence by allegedly approving the Merger Agreement at an unfair price and through an unfair process. Plaintiff alleges that the Legacy C J board directors, or certain of them (i) failed to fully inform themselves of the market value of Legacy C J, maximize its value and obtain the best price reasonably available for Legacy C J, (ii) acted in bad faith and for improper motives, (iii) erected barriers to discourage other strategic alternatives and (iv) put their personal interests ahead of the interests of Legacy C J shareholders. The Shareholder Litigation further alleges that Legacy C J, Nabors and New C J aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the Legacy C J board of directors. 
    
  On October 29, 2015, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming additional defendants and generally alleging, in addition to the allegations described above, that (i) the special committee of the Legacy C J board of directors and its advisors improperly conducted the court-ordered solicitation that the Delaware Supreme Court vacated and (ii) the proxy statement filed in connection with the Merger contains alleged misrepresentations and omits allegedly material information concerning the Merger and court-ordered solicitation process.  The Shareholder Litigation asserts, in addition to the claims described above, claims for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the special committee of the Legacy C J board of directors, its financial advisor Morgan Stanley, and certain employees of Legacy C J.  Following the death of Josh Comstock, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Plaintiff substituted the executor of Mr. Comstock s estate in place of Mr. Comstock as a defendant in the Shareholder Litigation.  
    
  The defendants in the Shareholder Litigation filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. On August 24, 2016, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware granted defendants  motions and dismissed the Shareholder Litigation in its entirety with prejudice. On September 22, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, appealing the dismissal of the Shareholder Litigation. Plaintiffs  appeal is pending. 
    
  We cannot predict the outcome of this or any other lawsuit that might be filed, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the Shareholder Litigation. We believe the Shareholder Litigation is without merit and we intend to defend against it vigorously. 
    
  U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Investigation into Pre-Merger Incident 
    
  There is a pending criminal investigation led by the United States Attorney s Office for the District of North Dakota in connection with a fatality that occurred at a C P Business facility in Williston, North Dakota on October 3, 2014 - notably prior to the Company's acquisition of the C P Business in the Merger.  We are cooperating fully with the investigation, and will continue to do so.   At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the investigation.
