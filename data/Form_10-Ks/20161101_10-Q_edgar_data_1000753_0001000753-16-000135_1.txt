1. 
    Basis of Presentation 

Insperity, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Insperity,   we,   our,  and  us ), provides an array of human resources ( HR ) and business solutions designed to help improve business performance.  Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our professional employer organization ( PEO ) services, known as Workforce Optimization        and Workforce Synchronization   TM    solutions (together, our  PEO HR Outsourcing solutions ), which encompass a broad range of HR functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers  compensation, government compliance, performance management, and training and development services, along with our cloud-based human capital management platform, the Employee Service Center   SM   . 
    
  In addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Human Capital Management, Payroll Software, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Financial and Expense Management services, Retirement Services and Insurance Services, many of which are offered via desktop applications and cloud-based delivery models.  These other products and services are offered separately, as a bundle, or along with our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. 
    
  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Insperity and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements at and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information or footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016   and our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and our Consolidated Statement of Stockholders  Equity for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , have been prepared by us without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, have been made.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. 
    
  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations. 

2. 
    Accounting Policies 

Health Insurance Costs 
    
  We provide group health insurance coverage to our worksite employees through a national network of carriers, including UnitedHealthcare ( United ), UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield, and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts. 
    
  The policy with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage.  As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the  Plan Costs ) as benefits expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (i) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (ii) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (iii) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA

     Table of Contents  

enrollees.  Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs. 
    
  Additionally, since the plan s inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates   90   days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter.  If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and a liability for the excess costs would be accrued in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The terms of the arrangement require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of   $9.0 million  , which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance.  In addition, United requires a deposit equal to approximately one day of claims funding activity, which was   $4.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and is reported as a long-term asset.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Plan Costs were less than the net premiums paid and owed to United by   $15.7 million  .  As this amount is   in excess of   the agreed-upon   $9.0 million   surplus maintenance level, the   $6.7 million   difference is included in   prepaid insurance, a current asset  , in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The premiums owed to United at   September 30, 2016   were   $16.9 million  , which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Our benefits costs incurred in the first   nine   months of   2016   included costs of   $4.6 million   for changes in estimated run-off related to prior periods. 
    
  Workers  Compensation Costs 
    
  Our workers  compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies (the  Chubb Program ) since 2007.  The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities.  Under the Chubb Program, we bear the economic burden for the first   $1 million   layer of claims per occurrence, as well as a maximum aggregate amount of   $5 million   per policy year for claim amounts that exceed   $1 million  .  Chubb bears the economic burden for all claims in excess of these levels. 
    
  Because we bear the economic burden for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers  compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred.  Workers  compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury.  Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment. 
    
  We employ a third party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of worksite employees  job responsibilities, the location of worksite employees, the historical frequency and severity of workers  compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends.  Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers  compensation claims cost estimates.  During the   nine   months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  , our workers  compensation costs decreased by   $9.1 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods.  Workers  compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate utilized in both the   2016   period and the   2015   period was   1.0%  ) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides the activity and balances related to incurred but not paid workers  compensation claims: 

The current portion of accrued workers  compensation costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   includes   $2.2 million   of workers  compensation administrative fees. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the undiscounted accrued workers  compensation costs were   $187.7 million   and   $164.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  At the beginning of each policy period, the workers  compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds ).  The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and expected workers  compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier.  Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within   one year   are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits - workers  compensation, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , we received   $12.8 million   and   $5.3 million  , respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers  compensation program.  This resulted in a net decrease to deposits.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had restricted cash of   $41.8 million   and deposits - workers  compensation of   $134.6 million  .   
    
  Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within   one year   is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  We believe we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations, other than discussed below. 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09.  We are currently evaluating the guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

-   11   - 

     Table of Contents  

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,   Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software   providing guidance on the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement, including whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer is required to account for the software license consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Conversely, if the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.  2016-02,   Leases  . The new standard requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases previously classified as operating leases.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently reviewing the guidance and assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The ASU includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation payments, including (i) permitting the election of estimated or actual forfeitures for share grants, (ii) allowing excess tax benefits for share-based payments to be recorded as a reduction of income taxes reflected in operating cash flows in place of excess tax benefits currently recorded in equity and as financing activity in the cash flow statement, and (iii) providing for statutory withholding requirements.  This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for public entities beginning after December 15, 2016; however, it can be elected early in any interim or annual period.  We have elected to prospectively adopt this pronouncement for calendar year 2016, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of   $1.0 million  , or   $0.05   per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 related to excess tax benefits from the vesting of restricted stock awards.  Prior to the adoption of this pronouncement excess tax benefits were required to be reported as an increase in additional paid in capital.  Prior periods have not been adjusted.

    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 

The following table summarizes our cash and investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities held by investment managers and overnight investments: 

Our cash and overnight holdings fluctuate based on the timing of clients  payroll processing cycles.  Included in the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are   $148.8 million   and   $185.7 million  , respectively, of funds associated with federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, as well as   $8.7 million   and   $17.0 million   in client prepayments, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

We account for our financial assets in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 820,   Fair Value Measurement  .  This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The fair value measurement disclosures are grouped into three levels based on valuation factors: 

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets using identical assets 
                
    Level 2 - significant other observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs 
                
    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs 
       
  The following table summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of our financial assets: 

The municipal bond securities valued as Level 2 investments are primarily pre-refunded municipal bonds that are secured by escrow funds containing U.S. government securities.  Our valuation techniques used to measure fair value for these securities during the period consisted primarily of third party pricing services that utilized actual market data such as trades of comparable bond issues, broker/dealer quotations for the same or similar investments in active markets and other observable inputs. 
    
  The following is a summary of our available-for-sale marketable securities:

    Impairment Charges and Other 

In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a plan to sell our two aircraft, and as a result, we recorded impairment and other charges of   $9.8 million  , representing the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets as well as a provision for potential settlement of a Texas sales and use tax assessment.  The fair value of assets held for sale of   $13.5 million   was determined based on the estimated selling price less costs incurred to sell and was classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  In July 2015, we received proceeds, net of selling costs, of   $12.2 million   for both aircraft and recorded an additional   $1.3 million   impairment charge in the second quarter of 2015.  In the first quarter of 2016, we settled the Texas sales and use tax assessment. 
   
                 5. 
    Long-Term Debt 

We have a revolving credit facility (the  Facility ), which was increased from   $125 million   to   $200 million   in the first quarter of 2016.  The Facility may be further increased to   $250 million   based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement relating to the Facility (the  Credit Agreement ).  The Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit.  Our obligations under the Facility are secured by   65%   of the stock of our captive insurance subsidiary and are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries.  In January 2016, we had net borrowings of   $104.4 million   to fund a portion of the purchase price of our modified Dutch auction tender offer.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had an outstanding   $1.0 million   letter of credit issued under the Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding balance on the Facility was   $104.4 million  . 
    
  The Facility matures on   February 6, 2020  .  Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an   alternate base rate   or   LIBOR  , at our option, plus an applicable margin.  Depending on our leverage ratio, the applicable margin varies (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, from   2.00%   to   2.75%   and (ii) in the case of   alternate base rate   loans, from   0.00%   to   0.75%  .  The alternate base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate most recently published in The Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   and (iii) the 30-day LIBOR rate plus   2.00%  .  We also pay an unused commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Facility at a rate of   0.25%  .  The interest rate at   September 30, 2016   was   2.19%  .  Interest expense and unused commitment fees are recorded in other income (expense). 
    
  The Facility contains both affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for arrangements of this nature.  Covenants include, but are not limited to, limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell material assets, retire, redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock, acquire the capital stock or assets of another business, make investments and pay dividends.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants limiting our total funded debt, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio.  We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The carrying value of our borrowings under the Facility approximates their fair value and was classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Stockholders' Equity 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased or withheld an aggregate of   3.2 million   shares of our common stock, as described below. 
    
  Tender Offer for Common Stock 
    
  In December 2015, we commenced a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to   $125 million   in value of our common stock at a price not less than   $43.50   per share and not more than   $50.00   per share.  In January 2016, we exercised our right to increase the size of the tender offer by up to 2.0% of our outstanding common stock.  The tender offer period expired on January 7, 2016 and on January 13, 2016, we purchased   3,013,531   shares of our common stock at a per share price of   $47.50   and an aggregate price of   $143.1 million  , excluding    $1.1 million   of transaction costs.  The shares were immediately canceled and retired. 
    
  The tender offer was funded through borrowings of   $104.4 million   under the Facility and the remainder with cash on hand. 
    
  Repurchase Program 
    
  Our Board of Directors (the  Board ) has authorized a program to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock ( Repurchase Program ).  The purchases are to be made from time to time in the open market or directly from stockholders at prevailing market prices based on market conditions and other factors.  In May 2016, the Board increased the authorized number of shares to be repurchased under the Repurchase Program by   one million  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   135,521   shares were repurchased under the Repurchase Program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were authorized to repurchase an additional   1,388,811   shares under the Repurchase Program. 
    
  Withheld Shares 
    
  During the   nine   months ended,   September 30, 2016  , we withheld   100,731   shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for the vesting of restricted stock awards. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  The Board declared quarterly dividends as follows: 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid dividends totaling   $15.3 million   and   $15.8 million  , respectively. 
   
                 7. 
    Long-Term Incentive Program 

On March 30, 2015, we adopted the Insperity, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Program (the  LTIP ) under the Insperity, Inc. 2012 Incentive Plan.  The LTIP provides for performance-based long-term compensation awards in the form of performance units to certain employees based on the achievement of pre-established performance goals.   
    
  Each performance unit represents the right to receive one common share at a future date based on our performance against specified targets.  Performance units have a vesting schedule of   three   years.  The fair value of each performance unit is the market price of one common share on the date of grant in the case of performance condition awards.  In the case of market condition awards, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo lattice model approach at the date of grant.  The compensation expense for such awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term.  For performance condition awards, the number of shares expected to be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achievement of the performance targets.

     Table of Contents  

The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized is based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. 
    
  The following is a summary of LTIP award activity for 2016: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate   178,770   shares and   127,429   shares will vest with   $4.6 million   and   $5.4 million   in unamortized compensation expense related to the 2015 and 2016 grants, respectively. 
   
                 8. 
    Net Income per Share 

We utilize the two-class method to compute net income per share.  The two-class method allocates a portion of net income to participating securities, which include unvested awards of share-based payments with non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends.  Net income allocated to unvested share-based payments is excluded from net income allocated to common shares.  Any undistributed losses resulting from dividends exceeding net income are not allocated to participating securities.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options. 
    
  The following table summarizes the net income allocated to common shares and the basic and diluted shares used in the net income per share computations:

Worksite Employee 401(k) Retirement Plan Class Action Litigation 
    
  In December 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and our third party discretionary trustee of the Insperity 401(k) retirement plan available to eligible worksite employees (the  Plan ) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division on behalf of Plan participants.  This suit generally alleges that the Company s third-party

     Table of Contents  

discretionary trustee of the Plan and Insperity breached their fiduciary duties to plan participants by selecting an Insperity subsidiary to serve as the recordkeeper for the Plan, by causing participants in the Plan to pay excessive recordkeeping fees to the Insperity subsidiary, by failing to monitor other fiduciaries and by making imprudent investment choices. We believe we have meritorious defenses and we intend to vigorously defend this litigation.  As a result of uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter,   no   provision has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
    
  We are a defendant in various other lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. Management believes it has valid defenses in these cases and is defending them vigorously.  While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Revenues 
    
  Our revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     12.2%   over the   2015   period, primarily due to a   13.3%     increase   in the average number of worksite employees paid per month, partially offset by a   1.0%  , or   $14  ,   decrease   in revenues per worksite employee per month.

  The percentage of total PEO HR Outsourcing solutions revenues in our significant markets include the following: 

Our growth in the number of worksite employees paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through worksite employee new hires and layoffs.  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we saw improvement in worksite employees paid from new client sales, while net change in existing clients declined and client retention was consistent with   2015  . 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     10.4%   over the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $117.8 million  .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables below. 
    
  Non-bonus payroll cost is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of bonus payrolls paid to our worksite employees.  Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to our ultimate workers  compensation costs under the current program.  As a result, our management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting our workers  compensation costs.  We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to the costs incurred under our current workers  compensation program.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchase, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs.  To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations.  Longer-term projects, large share repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity.  We have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources.  We had   $225.4 million   in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at   September 30, 2016  , of which approximately   $148.8 million   was payable in early   October     2016   for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, and approximately   $8.7 million   were customer prepayments that were payable in   October     2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had working capital of   $63.8 million   compared to   $54.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for the remainder of   2016  .  We will rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs. 
    
  We have a   $200 million   revolving credit facility ( Facility ) with a syndicate of financial institutions.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $34.8 million  .  Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our clients.  Our cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts.  These include the following: 

Timing of client payments / payroll levels     We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client s payroll funding, from clients at least one day prior to the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes.  Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows.  For example, many worksite employees are paid on Fridays; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday or a Monday.  In the period ended   September 30, 2016  , the last business day of the reporting period was a   Friday  , client prepayments were   $8.7 million   and accrued worksite employee payroll was   $202.5 million  .  In the period ended June 30, 2016, the last business day of the reporting period was a Thursday, client prepayments were $100.7 million and accrued worksite employee payroll was $277.4 million 

Workers  compensation plan funding     Under our workers  compensation insurance arrangements, we make monthly payments to the carriers comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds ).  These pre-determined amounts are stipulated in our agreements with the carriers, and are based primarily on anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers  compensation loss rates during the policy year.  Changes in payroll levels from those that were anticipated in the arrangements can result in changes in the amount of cash payments, which will impact our reporting of operating cash flows.  Our claim funds paid, based upon anticipated worksite employee payroll levels and workers  compensation loss rates, were   $44.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $40.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  However, our estimate of workers  compensation incurred claims was   $45.2 million   in the   2016   period and   $47.8 million   in the   2015   period. During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , we received   $12.8 million   and   $5.3 million  , respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers  compensation program.  This resulted in an increase to working capital. 

Medical plan funding     Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates   90   days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter.  Therefore, changes in the participation level of the United plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows.  In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are solely determined by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows.  As of   September 30, 2016  , premiums owed and cash funded to United have exceeded the costs of the United plan, resulting in a   $15.7 million   surplus,   $6.7 million   of which is reflected as a current asset, and   $9.0 million   of which is reflected as a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The premiums, including additional quarterly premium, owed to United at   September 30, 2016  , were   $16.9 million  , which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Funding rates, as determined by United, resulted in   $14.1 million   of additional quarterly premium at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $6.2 million   of additional quarterly premium at   September 30, 2015  . 

Operating results     Our adjusted net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows.  Our adjusted net income   increased     38.4%   to   $64.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $46.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to higher gross profit.  Please read  Results of Operations       Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  .  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows   used in   investing activities were   $13.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to property and equipment purchases of   $21.3 million  , offset by   $8.0 million   of marketable securities maturities and dispositions, net of purchases. The increase in property and equipment purchases related to the construction of a new facility located on our corporate campus for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately $10.5 million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows   used in   financing activities were   $67.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the $144.3 million used to repurchase common stock associated with the modified Dutch auction tender offer, which was funded in part with borrowings of $104.4 million under our Facility.  Please read   Note 5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Long-Term Debt  ,  and   Note 6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,    Stockholders' Equity  ,        for additional information.  In addition, we repurchased   $13.9 million   in stock and paid   $15.3 million   in dividends during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
    
  We are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash equivalent short-term investments, our available-for-sale marketable securities and our borrowings under our Facility, which bears interest at a variable market rate.  
    
   The cash equivalent short-term investments consist primarily of overnight investments, which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk, except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments.  The available-for-sale marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate.  As a result, the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an outstanding letter of credit and borrowings totaling   $105.4 million   under the Facility.  Please read   Note 5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements,      Long-Term Debt  ,  for additional information.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. 
    
  Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  The statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act).  You can identify such forward-looking statements by the words  expects,   intends,   plans,   projects,   believes,   estimates,   likely,   possibly,   probably,   goal,   opportunity,   objective,   target,   assume,   outlook,   guidance,   predicts,   appears,   indicator  and similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  In the normal course of business, Insperity, Inc., in an effort to help keep our stockholders and the public informed about our operations, may from time to time issue such forward-looking statements, either orally or in writing.  Generally, these statements relate to business plans or strategies, projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies, or projections involving anticipated revenues, earnings, unit growth, profit per worksite employee, pricing, operating expenses or other aspects of operating results.  We base the forward-looking statements on our expectations, estimates and projections at the time such statements are made.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that we cannot predict.  In addition, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate.  Therefore, the actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements.  Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: (i) adverse economic conditions; (ii) regulatory and tax developments and possible adverse application of various federal, state and local regulations; (iii) the ability to secure competitive replacement contracts for health insurance and workers  compensation insurance at expiration of current contracts; (iv) cancellation of client contracts on short notice, or the inability to renew client contracts or attract new clients; (v) vulnerability to regional economic factors because of our geographic market concentration; (vi) increases in health insurance costs and workers  compensation rates and underlying claims trends, health care reform, financial solvency of workers  compensation carriers, other insurers or financial institutions, state unemployment tax rates, liabilities for employee and client actions or payroll-related claims; (vii) failure to manage growth of our operations and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; (viii) the impact of the competitive environment in the PEO industry on our growth and/or profitability; (ix) our liability for worksite employee payroll, payroll taxes and benefits costs; (x) our liability for disclosure of sensitive or private information; (xi) our ability to integrate or realize expected returns on our acquisitions; (xii) failure of our information technology systems; (xiii) an adverse final judgment or settlement of claims against Insperity; and (xiv) disruptions to our business resulting from the actions of certain stockholders.  These factors are discussed in further detail in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in Part I and  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Part II, and elsewhere in this report.  Any of these factors, or a combination of such factors, could materially affect the results of our operations and whether forward-looking statements we make ultimately prove to be accurate.   
    
  Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities law, we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
    
  The following table provides information about purchases by Insperity during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , of equity securities that are registered by Insperity pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act: 

____________________________________ 
    
            (1)   
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   136   shares of restricted stock were withheld to satisfy tax-withholding obligations arising in conjunction with the vesting of restricted stock.  The required withholding is calculated using the closing sales price reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the date prior to the applicable vesting date.  These shares are not subject to the repurchase program described above. 
       
            (2)   
    Our Board of Directors (the  Board ) has approved a program to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock, including an additional one million shares authorized for repurchase in May 2016.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   135,521   shares were repurchased under the program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were authorized to repurchase an additional   1,388,811   shares under the program.  Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Board, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program.
