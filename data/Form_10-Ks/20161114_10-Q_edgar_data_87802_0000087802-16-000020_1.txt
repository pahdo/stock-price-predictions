The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Scientific Industries, Inc., Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc.,
an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, Inc.
("Altamira"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and
Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. ("SBI"), a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary, (all collectively referred to as the
"Company"). All material intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.

2.	New Accounting Pronouncements:

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock
Compensation(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting" (ASU 2016-09). Areas for simplification in this update involve
several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU
2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the timing, impact and method of applying this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires
lessees to  account for most leases on their balance sheets with the
liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments. The right-
of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs
such as direct costs. Lease expense will be recognized similar to current
accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line
expense and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to
the current accounting for capital leases. This guidance becomes effective
for the Company's fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted.
This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the

6

earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for
certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the timing,
impact and method of applying this guidance on its consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance simplifying the balance sheet
classification of deferred taxes.  The new guidance requires that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and
presented as a single amount is not affected by the new guidance. The
guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted as
of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The new guidance
may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and
assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not
expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial condition,
results of operations 	or cash flows.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Inventory: Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory", that requires inventory not measured using either
the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation. The new standard
will be effective for 	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied
prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the
adoption to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers amending revenue recognition requirements for multiple-
deliverable revenue arrangements. This update provides guidance on how
revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. This
determination is made in five steps: (i) identify the contract with the
customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue
when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In July 2015,
the FASB deferred the effective date to fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not
before the original effective date of December 15, 2017.  The Company is
evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.

3. 	Segment Information and Concentrations:

The Company views its operations as three segments:  the manufacture and
marketing of standard benchtop laboratory equipment including the balances
and scales by its Torbal Scales Division for research in university,
hospital and industrial laboratories sold primarily through laboratory
equipment distributors and on a direct basis ("Benchtop Laboratory
Equipment"), the manufacture and marketing of custom-made catalyst research

                                7

instruments for universities, government laboratories, and chemical and
petrochemical companies sold on a direct basis ("Catalyst Research
Instruments") and the design and marketing of bioprocessing systems for
laboratory research in the biotechnology industry sold directly to
customers and through distributors and related royalty income
("Bioprocessing Systems").

Approximately 49% and 47% of net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment
for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were derived from the Company's main product, the Vortex-Genie 2(R) mixer,
excluding accessories.

Approximately 26% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales were
derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

8

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, two
customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately  16% and 13% of net
sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 11% of the
Company's total revenues).  Sales of catalyst research instruments generally
comprise a few very large orders averaging at least $100,000 per order to a
limited number of customers, who differ from order to order.  Sales to one
customer (who differed from period-to-period) during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, accounted respectively, for approximately 57%
and 76% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations' revenues and 3% and
8% of the Company's total revenues, respectively.

4.	Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs.

The accounting guidance also expands the disclosure requirements around
fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs.
The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent
to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.
Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which
is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety.  These levels are described below:

	Level 1	Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for
identical instruments traded in active markets.

	Level 2	Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be
active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are
observable, either directly or indirectly.

       Level 3  Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy
the Company's financial assets that were accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 according to the
valuation techniques the Company used to determine their fair values:

Approximately 43,500 and 38,500 shares of the Company's Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the
calculation of diluted loss per common share, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, because the effect would be anti-dilutive due
to the loss for each period.

7.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company's acquisition of
Altamira and SBI's acquisition of assets.  Goodwill amounted to $705,300
as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, all of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes.

 The components of other intangible assets are as follows:

			  Useful                Accumulated
			  Lives        Cost     Amortization     Net

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations

Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts,
but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions
about future conditions.  Actual events in the future could differ materially
from those described in the forward-looking information.  Numerous unknown
factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not
limited to, product demand, market acceptance, impact of competition, the
ability to reach final agreements, the ability to finance and produce to
customers' specifications for catalyst research instruments, and to develop
marketable bioprocessing systems, adverse economic conditions, and other
factors affecting the Company's business that are beyond the Company's control.
Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $279,000 to $966,000 as of September 30,
2016 from $1,245,000 as of June 30, 2016.

Net cash used in operating activities was $151,700 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $44,400 for the comparable three month period
in 2015, reflecting lower accounts receivable balances, increased prepayments
to vendors, decreased accrued expense items, partially offset by increased
advances from customers for catalyst research instrument orders.  Cash used in
investing activities was $8,400 for the three month period ended September 30,
2016 compared to $6,500 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.
Cash used in financing activities was $118,900 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided of $99,100 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 because of the proceeds received under the line of
credit in the prior year.

The Company's working capital decreased by $102,700 to $3,929,200 at September
30, 2016 from $4,031,900 at June 30, 2016.

The Company has two lines of credit through June 2017 with First National Bank
of Pennsylvania - an Export-Related Revolving Line of Credit which is
guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States which provides for
export-related borrowings of up to $200,000, bearing interest at prime plus 1%
and an annual fee of 1.75% and a second one-year Demand Line of Credit
which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital
needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 3.50%.  Advances on both lines are
secured by a pledge of the Company's assets including inventory, accounts,
chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company.  As of
September 30, 2016 no borrowings were outstanding under either line.

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs
during the next 12 months from its available financial resources which include
its cash and investment securities, lines of credit, and operations.

Results of Operations

Financial Overview

The Company incurred a loss of $69,600 before income tax benefit for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $77,900 before income tax
benefit for the comparable period last year, the improvement is primarily due
to higher sales and margins generated by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment
Operations.  The result included non-cash amounts for depreciation and
amortization of $95,700 and $105,200 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2015

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $114,600
(7.9%) to $1,559,100 from $1,444,500 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, primarily as a result of a $193,800 increase in benchtop laboratory
equipment sales.  Sales of catalyst research instruments, and bioprocessing
revenues decreased by $75,500 and $3,700 respectively. Catalyst research
instruments are sold pursuant to a small number of larger orders, typically
averaging over $100,000 each, resulting in significant swings in revenues, and
the Bioprocessing Systems Operations' revenues consist primarily of earned
royalties.  The backlog of orders for catalyst research instruments was
$1,167,000 as of September 30, 2016, substantially all of which is expected to
be delivered by fiscal year end, as compared to the backlog as of September 30,
2015 of $2,944,000.

The gross profit percentage for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased to 42.9% compared to 41.2% for the three months ended September 30,
2015, primarily due to higher sales for the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment
Operations.

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 amounted to $412,400 compared to $408,200 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.

Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$49,800 (29.8%) to $216,800 from $167,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, primarily the result of increased advertising expenses for benchtop
laboratory equipment and trade show expense for the Catalyst Research
Instruments Operations.

Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased by $30,000 (35.1%) to $115,400 from $85,400 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to increased new product development
activity by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations.

Total other income was $5,400 for the three month period ended September 30,
2016 compared to $12,400 expense for the three month period ended September 30,
2015 due to miscellaneous income items in the current year and reduced interest
expense.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the income tax benefit was
$20,800 compared to income tax benefit of $17,800 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.

                               14

As a result, the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was
$48,800 compared to a net loss of $60,100 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.
