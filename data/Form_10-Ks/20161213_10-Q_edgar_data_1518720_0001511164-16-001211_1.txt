FORCE PROTECTION VIDEO EQUIPMENT CORP.  
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  
  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 AND 2015  

NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND GOING CONCERN   
   
  Organization  
   
 Force Protection Video Equipment Corp., (the Company), was incorporated on March 11, 2011, under the laws of the State of Florida as M Street Gallery, Inc.  On September 25, 2013, we changed our name to Enhance-Your-Reputation.com, Inc. and changed our business to providing reputation management and enhancement services. On February 2, 2015 the Company changed its name to Force Protection Video Corp. to focus on the sale of mini body video cameras and accessories to consumers and law enforcement.   
   
  Going Concern  
   
 The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
   
 During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company recognized revenue of $33,176 and a net operating loss of $402,112. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had net working capital of $11,014 and an accumulated deficit of $2,314,263. 
   
 In view of these conditions, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations. Historically, the Company has relied upon funds from the sale of shares of stock, issuance of promissory notes and loans from its shareholders and private investors to finance its operations and growth. Management is planning to raise necessary additional funds for working capital through loans and/or additional sales of its common stock. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Should the Company be unable to raise this amount of capital its operating plans will be limited to the amount of capital that it can access. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which will be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
   
   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The unaudited financial statements of Force Protection Video Equipment Corp. (the  Company ) as of October 31, 2016, and for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the Company s Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial information have been included. The Company did not record an income tax provision during the periods presented due to net taxable losses. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year. 

7 

Estimates   
   
 The preparation of the Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
   
   Inventory   
   
 Our inventory is comprised of finished goods, cameras and recording equipment. The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company also makes prepayments against the future delivery of inventory classified as prepaid inventory. 
   
   Accounts Receivable   
   
 Accounts receivable are reported at the customers' outstanding balances.  The Company does not have a history of significant bad debt and has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts.  Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable.  The Company evaluates receivables on a regular basis for potential reserve. 
   
   Property and Equipment   
   
 Fixed assets are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized, while repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. 
   
 For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. Depreciation for financial statement purposes is computed on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are: 

Estimated 

Useful Lives 
  
    Vehicles 
     
        5 years 
  
   Office Equipment 
      
   3 - 5 years 
  
   Furniture   equipment 
      
   5 - 7 years 

8 

Income Taxes   
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.   The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain income tax positions, if any, taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. Estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense or other expense, respectively. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue when (a) pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists (b) products are delivered or services have been rendered (c) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (d) collection is reasonably assured.  
   
   Marketing and Advertising Costs   
   
  Marketing and advertising costs are anticipated to be expensed as incurred. The Company recognized $22,513 and $68,874 in marketing and advertising costs during the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, respectively. The Company recognized $3,929 and $18,226 in marketing and advertising costs during the three and six months ended October 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
   Stock Based Compensation   
   
 The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50. 
   
   Fair Value Measurements   
   
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:  
   
 Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
   
 Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 

9 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
   
 As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis or on a non-recurring basis.   
   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
   
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect those estimates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we utilize derivative instruments. 
   
   Net Income (Loss) Per Share   
   
 The computation of basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is based on the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period, including shares of common stock that are issuable at the end of the reporting period. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the number of basic weighted-average shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. The computation of diluted net income per share does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent issuance of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share. Therefore, when calculating EPS, if the Company experienced a loss, there is no inclusion of dilutive securities as their inclusion in the EPS calculation is antidilutive. Furthermore, options and warrants will have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants (they are in the money).  
   
 Following is the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015:

Concentrations of risk  
   
 During the three months ended October 31, 2016, three customers accounted for 50.2% (19.8%, 17.2% and 13.2%) of sales. During the three months ended October 31, 2015, two customers accounted for 26.1% (16.0% and 10.1%) of sales.  
   
 During the six months ended October 31, 2016, one customer accounted for 10.4% of sales. During the six months ended October 31, 2015, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales.  
   
 The Company relies on third parties for   the supply and manufacture of its capture devices, some of which are sole-source suppliers.  The Company believes that outsourcing manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility. As demand and product lines change, the Company periodically evaluates the need and advisability of adding manufacturers to support its operations.  In instances where a supply and manufacture agreement does not exist or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, the Company may be unable to find alternative suppliers or satisfactorily deliver its products to its customers on time, if at all.  During the three months ended October 31, 2016, one supplier accounted for 62.5% of our inventory purchases. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, two suppliers accounted for 88.0% (76.2% and 11.8%) of our inventory purchases. During the three months ended October 31, 2015, one supplier accounted for 96.4% of our inventory purchases. During the six months ended October 31, 2015, one supplier accounted for 95.0% of our inventory purchases. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02 amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the statements of operations and statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this accounting update to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
   
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805). This ASU eliminates the requirement for retrospective application of measurement period adjustments relating to provisional amounts recorded in a business combination as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this accounting update to have a material effect on its financial statements in future periods, although that could change.  
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). This ASU provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. For public business entities, the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. 

11 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU requires retrospective adoption and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 to further clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this accounting update to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
   
 We review new accounting standards as issued. Although some of these accounting standards issued or effective after the end of our previous fiscal year may be applicable to us, we have not identified any standards that we believe merit further discussion. We believe that none of the new standards will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
   
   NOTE 3 - FIXED ASSETS   
   
 Fixed assets consisted of the following: 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $1,288 and $0, respectively, in depreciation expense. During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $2,224 and $0, respectively, in depreciation expense.

NOTE 4   CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES   
   
 Following is a summary of our outstanding convertible promissory notes as of October 31, 2016: 

Following is a summary of our outstanding convertible promissory notes as of April 30, 2016: 

13 

The company determined that each convertible promissory notes conversion feature is indexed to the Company s stock, which is an input to a fair value measurement of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. Thus, the conversion feature of the notes meets the scope exception under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815-40-15-7 and treatment under ASC 470-20    Debt with Conversion and Other Options  is appropriate.  
   
   LG Capital Funding, LLC   
   
 On September 11, 2015 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with LG Capital Funding, LLC ( LG ) for the sale of an 8% convertible note in the principal amount of $81,000 and proceeds of $75,000 net of legal expenses (the  LG Note ).  
   
 The LG Note was convertible into common stock at a price equal to 60% of the lowest trading price during the 20 trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion.   
   
 The LG Note principle was discounted for the value of the legal fees of $6,000 and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of $68,000. The resulting $74,000 discount was fully accreted through July 31, 2016 due to full repayment of the LG Note on May 2, 2016. 
   
 During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company recognized no interest expense and debt discount accretion of $7,741. On May 2, 2016, LG converted the remaining $13,034 of principal and interest into 775,844 shares of common stock. 
   
   Black Forest Capital, LLC   
   
 On October 8, 2015 the Company sold and Black Forest Capital, LLC ( Black Forest ) purchased a 10% convertible note in the principal amount of $53,000 (the  Black Forest Note ) of which the Company received $50,000 after payment of legal fees. The Black Forest Note matured in 12 months on October 8, 2016.   The Black Forest Note was convertible into common stock, at Black Forest s option anytime following the issuance date, at a price for each share of common stock equal to 40% of the lowest trading price during the 20 trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion.  
   
 The Black Forrest Note principle was discounted for the value of legal fees of $3,000 and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of $50,000. The calculated intrinsic value was $127,199. As this amount resulted in a total debt discount that exceeded the Black Forest Note principal, the discount recorded for the beneficial conversion feature was limited to the principal amount of the Black Forest Note. The resulting $53,000 discount was accreted through July 31, 2016 due to repayment of the Black Forest Note. 
   
 During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company recognized no interest expense and debt discount accretion of $9,992. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, Black Forrest converted the remaining $22,499 of principal and interest into 11,076,775 shares of common stock.

RDW Capital, LLC   
   
 On November 12, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( RDW SPA 1 ) with RDW Capital, LLC ( RDW ), a Florida limited liability company. On November 12, 2015, the Company and RDW entered into the First Amended Securities Purchase Agreement. On November 12, 2015, the Company and RDW entered into the Second Amended Securities Purchase Agreement. On February 17, 2016, the Company and RDW entered into the Third Amended Securities Purchase Agreement. On February 17, 2016, the Company and RDW entered into the Fourth Amended Securities Purchase Agreement. On May 9, 2016, the Company and RDW entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( RDW SPA 2 ). On August 22, 2016, the Company and RDW entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( RDW SPA 3 ). On September 1, 2016, the Company and RDW entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( RDW SPA 4 ). RDW SPA 1, amendments thereto, RDW SPA 2, RDW SPA 3 and RDW SPA 4 may hereinafter be referred to collectively as, the   RDW SPAs  .  
   
  RDW Note 1  - In connection with RDW SPA 1 and amendments thereto, on November 12, 2016, the Company issued to RDW a convertible note ( RWD Note 1 ) due on April 10, 2016 in the principal amount of $157,500 of which the Company received proceeds of $130,000 after payment of a $7,500 original issue discount (  OID  ) and legal and due diligence fees totaling $20,000.  
   
 RDW Note 1 principle was discounted for the value of the OID, due diligence fees and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature. The calculated intrinsic value was $121,406. As this amount resulted in a total debt discount that was less than RDW Note 1 principal, the full $121,406 discount was recognized. The resulting $148,906 discount was accreted over the 5 month term of RDW Note 1 through April 10, 2016. 
   
  RDW Note 2  - In connection with RDW SPA 1 and amendments thereto, on December 31, 2015, the Company issued to RDW a convertible note ( RDW Note 2 ) due on June 30, 2016 in the principal amount of $105,000 of which the Company received proceeds of $90,000 after payment of a $5,000 OID and due diligence fees totaling $10,000.

   Forward Looking Statements   
     
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed  financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our April 30, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words  believe,   may,   will,   estimate,   continue,   anticipate,   intend,   expect  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our estimates of our financial results and our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  
     
  You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.  
     
  You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.  
     
  As used herein, the  Company,   our,   we,  or  us  and similar terms refers to Enhance-Your-Reputation.com, Inc. unless the context indicates otherwise.  
   
  Overview  
   
  The Company is in the business of selling video and audio capture devices initially targeted to law enforcement agencies. The Company has established a web site at www.forceprovideo.com whereby customers can view the Company s products and place orders. We believe that given recent current events between law enforcement agencies and the public, which has been widely reported by the media, there is a significant market opportunity for the Company s products.    

20 

Products  
   
 Our video and audio capture devices are compact, ergonomic, tamperproof and designed to capture HD video and/or audio on demand enabling our customers to capture content while engaged in a wide range of activity. We also sell accessories that enhance the functionality and versatility of our products, including mounts, such as the helmet, handlebar, roll bar and tripod mounts, as well as mounts that enable users to wear the camera on their bodies, such as the wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Other accessories include spare batteries, charging accessories and memory drives. Our products are marketed primarily to law enforcement due to their unique need to capture important events in the course of their duties. 
   
 Our primary hardware products consist of the LE10 Law Enforcement Video Recorder, LE50 HD Body Cam, SC1 Sunglass Camera and Citadel 3G Solar Security Camera  
   
  Distribution

  Results of Operations   
   
 As of  October  31, 2016, we had total assets of $360,566 and total liabilities of $327,111.  Since our inception to  October  31, 2016, we have accumulated a deficit of $2,314,263. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities. 
   
  Three and six months ended  October  31, 2016 compared with the three and six months ended October 31, 2015  
   
  Revenue  
   
 Revenue is generated from the sale of our video and audio capture devices and related accessories. For the three months ended  October  31, 2016, the Company recognized $17,464 of revenue compared to $19,614 during the three ended October 31, 2015. For the six months ended  October  31, 2016, the Company recognized $33,176 of revenue compared to $35,548 during the six ended October 31, 2015. Sales were down $2,150 and $2,372 for the three and six months, respectively compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales is due to a slight decrease in product demand. To increase future sales volume, the Company has begun to actively seek out and submit competitive product quotes in response to police department requests for quotes ( RFQ ) domestically and internationally. The Company expects sales subject to RFQ to close between 3 to 12 months from submission.  

21 

Gross profit  
   
 Gross profit was $5,091 and $7,198 during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross profit was $9,400 and $13,431 during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Gross margin for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was 29.2% and 36.7%, respectively. Our Gross margin for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was 28.3% and 37.8%, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was due to increased volumes of lower margin product. The Company anticipates fluctuations in the mix of product sales and cannot meaningfully determine at this early stage if our gross margin will increase or decrease with any degree of accuracy. 
   
  Operating Expenses  
   
 General and administrative costs include costs related to personnel, professional fees, travel and entertainment, public company costs, insurance and other office related costs. General and administrative costs increased to $154,957 during the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $102,925 during the three months ended October 31, 2015. General and administrative costs increased to $322,306 during the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $147,640 during the six months ended October 31, 2015. General and administrative costs increased due to the Company beginning meaningful operations to promote and sell our products and administer the Company.  
   
 Sales and marketing costs include costs to promote and sell our products. Sales and marketing costs increased to $30,579 during the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $6,345 the three months ended October 31, 2015. Sales and marketing costs increased to $89,205 during the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $20,905 the six months ended October 31, 2015. Sales and marketing costs increased due to increased marketing activities to brand and promote our products. 
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 All the elements of other expense relate to our convertible promissory notes. During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, other expense totaled $169,482 and $47,275, respectively. During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, other expense totaled $437,026 and $47,275, respectively. 
   
  Liquidity and Working Capital  
   
 Our principal source of liquidity is cash in the bank and salable inventory. As of October 31, 2016, our current assets totaled $337,254 and were comprised primarily of $158,603 in cash and $147,930 of inventory. We expect to incur losses as we introduce our products and services. These conditions raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements, and continue to operate, additional financing will be necessary. We expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of business operations. We will try to raise additional funds through private or public equity but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
 For the six months ended October 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $439,690, compared to $197,881 for the six months ended October 31, 2015.  
   
 For the six months ended October 31, 2016, net cash flows used in investing activities was $16,480, compared to $671 for the six months ended October 31, 2015.  
   
 For the six months ended October 31, 2016, we generated cash flows from financing activities of $387,500 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes compared to $45,000 from the sale of common stock and $288,004 of convertible promissory notes for the six months ended October 31, 2015. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of debt and equity. 

22 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 See Note 2 to our Financial Statements for more information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact to our results of operations and financial position. 

ITEM 4.          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 As of October 31, 2016, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a   15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures have been found to be ineffective. 
   
 The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 Management s assessment of ineffectiveness is due to the following: 
   
 (1)      Lack of segregation of duties .  Management has found it necessary to limit the Company s administrative staffing in order to conserve cash, until the Company s level of business activity increases. As a result, there is limited segregation of duties amongst the employees, and the Company has identified this as a material weakness in the Company s internal controls. The Company intends to remedy this material weakness by hiring additional employees and reallocating duties, including responsibilities for financial reporting, among the employees as soon as there are sufficient resources available. However, until such time, this material weakness will continue to exist. Despite the limited number of employees and limited segregation of duties, management believes that the Company is capable of following its disclosure controls and procedures effectively. 
   
 (2)      Lack of in-house US GAAP Expertise.   Our current accounting personnel perform adequately in the basic accounting and recordkeeping function.  However, our operations and business practices include complex technical accounting issues that are outside the routine basic functions.  These technical accounting issues are complex and require significant expertise to ensure that the accounting and reporting are accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
   
  Changes in internal controls  
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
