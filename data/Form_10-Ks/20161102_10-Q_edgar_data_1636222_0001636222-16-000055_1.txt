(1)    Basis of Presentation  
  Basis of Presentation 
  Wingstop Inc. ( Wingstop  or the  Company ) is in the business of franchising and operating Wingstop restaurants. As of   September 24, 2016  ,   862   franchised restaurants were in operation domestically and   67   international franchised restaurants were in operation across   five   countries. As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company owned and operated   20   restaurants.   
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. Consequently, financial information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared annually in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. Balance sheet amounts are as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015   and operating results are for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  .  
  In the Company s opinion, all necessary adjustments have been made for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 26, 2015  . 
  The Company uses a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 have 53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No 2014-08,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  . The amendments in ASU 2014-08 change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in GAAP. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization s operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The Company adopted the amendment as of the first day of fiscal year 2016, and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This update permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and has not yet selected a transition method.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . This update changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt obligation to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than being presented as an asset. Amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  . This ASU clarified guidance in ASC 2015-03 stating that the SEC staff would not object to a company presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement on the balance sheet as a deferred asset, regardless of whether there were any outstanding borrowings at period-end. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this pronouncement during the first quarter of 2016 and applied the update on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each period presented was adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new  
  
   6 

    WINGSTOP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

guidance. The Company reclassed deferred financing costs of   $492,000   for the period ended   December 26, 2015   from other non-current assets to long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of its issuance is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . This update requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, including recognition of excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Currently, GAAP requires excess tax benefits to be recognized in additional paid-in capital; tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or in the income statement, and excess tax benefits are not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes payable. ASU 2016-09 further requires that excess tax benefits be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity on the Statement of Cash Flows. Currently, they are classified as financing activities. The update also allows entities to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and has not yet selected a transition method.  
   
  (2)    Earnings per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted net income per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted share awards, determined using the treasury stock method. For the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   we had approximately   5,000   stock options outstanding which were excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the   thirteen weeks ended     September 26, 2015   all stock options had a dilutive effect; therefore   none   were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, we had approximately   5,000   and   8,000   stock options outstanding which were excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
  Basic weighted average shares outstanding is reconciled to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows (in thousands): 

(3)    Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows:  
  Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.  
  Level 2   Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs corroborated by market data.  
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs reflecting management s estimates and assumptions.

  (Unaudited) 

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Fair value of debt is determined on a non-recurring basis, which results are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

(1)    The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using available market information. 
  The Company also measures certain non-financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, in connection with our periodic evaluations of such assets for potential impairment. 
   
  (4)        Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense and the effective tax rate were   $1.7 million   and   38.5%  , respectively, for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , and   $1.8 million   and   36.0%  , respectively, for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 26, 2015  . Income tax expense and the effective tax rate were   $6.7 million   and   37.6%  , respectively, for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , and   $3.8 million   and   37.3%  , respectively, for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 26, 2015  . 
   
  (5)        Debt Obligations 
  On June 30, 2016, the Company entered into a   $180.0 million   new senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ), which replaced the Company s second amended and restated credit facility dated March 18, 2015. The Credit Facility includes a term loan facility in an aggregate amount of   $70.0 million   and a revolving credit facility up to an aggregate amount of   $110.0 million  . The Company used the proceeds from the Credit Facility and cash on hand to refinance   $85.5 million   of indebtedness under the Company s   March 2015   debt facility and to pay a dividend of   $83.3 million   to its shareholders. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest, payable quarterly, at our option, at the base rate plus a margin (  1.00%   to   2.00%  , dependent on the Company s reported leverage ratio) or LIBOR plus a margin (  2.00%   to   3.00%  , dependent on the Company s reported leverage ratio). The Credit Facility matures in   June 2021  . As of September 24, 2016, the term loan facility had an outstanding balance of   $70.0 million   that bears interest at   3.38%  . 
  The revolving credit facility bears interest, payable quarterly, at our option, at the base rate plus a margin or LIBOR plus a margin, with all unpaid amounts due at maturity in   June 2021  . Any unused portion of the revolving credit facility bears a commitment fee (  0.375%   to   0.50%  , dependent on the Company s reported leverage ratio). As of   September 24, 2016  , the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of   $88.0 million  , which bears interest at   3.41%  .  
  In conjunction with the Credit Facility, the Company evaluated the refinancing of the   March 2015   second amended and restated credit facility and determined   $90.0 million   was accounted for as a debt modification and   $90.0 million   was new debt issuance. The Company incurred   $1.3 million   in financing costs of which   $0.1 million   was expensed and   $1.2 million   was capitalized and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method. Previously capitalized financing costs of   $0.2 million   were expensed as a result of the refinancing during the current period. 
  The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and requires compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. 
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the scheduled principal payments on debt were as follows (in thousands):

(6)    Commitments and Contingencies 
  Wingstop Restaurants, Inc. ( WRI ) leases certain office and retail space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with terms expiring at various dates through   July 2031  . 
  A schedule of future minimum rental payments required under our operating leases, excluding contingent rent, that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year, as of   September 24, 2016  , is as follows (in thousands): 

Rent expense under cancelable and non-cancelable leases was   $479,000   and   $531,000   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and   $1.4 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities, such as employment-related claims and premises-liability cases, which arise in the ordinary course of business and are generally covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to those actions should not have a material adverse impact on financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Many of the food products the Company purchases are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including chicken. The Company works with its suppliers and uses a mix of forward pricing protocols for certain items under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. 
  The Company s use of any forward pricing arrangements varies substantially from time to time and these arrangements tend to cover relatively short periods (i.e., typically twelve months or less). Such contracts are used in the normal purchases of our food products and not for speculative purposes, and as such are not required to be evaluated as derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into futures contracts or other derivative instruments. 
   
  (7)        Stock-Based Compensation 
  The following table summarizes stock option activity (in thousands, except per share data): 

The total grant-date fair value of stock options vested during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   was   $774,000  . The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   was   $3.3 million  .  
  The Company granted   11,724   shares of restricted stock awards during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $25.59  . The fair value of the non-vested restricted stock awards is based on the closing  
  
   9 

    WINGSTOP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

price on the date of grant. All of the outstanding restricted stock awards are non-vested and will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   3.2 years  . 
  Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite employee service period (generally the vesting period of the grant). The Company recognized   $392,000   in stock compensation expense for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital. As of   September 24, 2016  , there was   $2.9 million   of total unrecognized stock compensation expense related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock awards, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.2 years  . Stock compensation expense is included in SG A in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
   
  (8)        Business Segments

As of   September 24, 2016  , the franchise operations segment consisted of   929   restaurants operated by Wingstop franchisees in the United States and   five   countries outside of the United States as compared to   788   franchised restaurants in operation as of   September 26, 2015  .

Company restaurant expenses are operating expenses at company-owned restaurants and include food, beverage, labor, benefits, utilities, rent and other operating costs.  
  Information on segments and a reconciliation to income before taxes are as follows (in thousands):

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  below and  Risk Factors  on page 15 of our annual report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.  
  We operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of each calendar year. Our fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of a 53 week year, which contains 14 weeks. Fiscal years   2016   and   2015   contain 53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. 
  Overview  
  Wingstop is a high-growth franchisor and operator of restaurants that offer cooked-to-order, hand-sauced and tossed chicken wings.  
    
  We believe we pioneered the concept of wings as a  center-of-the-plate  item for all of our meal occasions. While other concepts include wings as add-on menu items or focus on wings in a bar or sports-centric setting, we are singularly focused on wings, fries and sides, which generate approximately   90%   of our system-wide sales.  
    
  We offer 11 bold, distinctive and craveable flavors on our bone-in and boneless chicken wings paired with hand-cut, seasoned fries and sides made fresh daily. Our menu is highly-customizable for different dining occasions, and we believe it delivers a compelling value proposition for groups, families, and individuals. We have broad and growing consumer appeal anchored by a sought after core demographic of 18-34 year old Millennials, which we believe is a loyal consumer group that dines at fast casual restaurants more frequently. 
    
  Founded in 1994 in Garland, Texas, we have sold approximately 4 billion wings since our inception. Today, Wingstop is the largest fast casual chicken wings-focused restaurant chain in the world and has demonstrated strong, consistent growth. As of   September 24, 2016  , we had a total   949   restaurants across   40   states and   six   countries in our system. Our restaurant base is   98%   franchised, with   929   franchised locations (including   67   international locations) and   20   company-owned restaurants.

Key Performance Indicators  
  Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following:  
  Number of restaurants.   Management reviews the number of new restaurants, the number of closed restaurants, and the number of acquisitions and divestitures of restaurants to assess net new restaurant growth, system-wide sales, royalty and franchise fee revenue and company-owned restaurant sales.    

System-wide sales.   System-wide sales represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants, as reported by franchisees. While we do not record franchised restaurant sales as revenue, our royalty revenue is calculated based on a percentage of franchised restaurant sales, which generally range from 5.0% to 6.0% of gross sales net of discounts. This measure allows management to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall store performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by new restaurant openings as well as increases in same store sales.    
  Average unit volume (AUV).   AUV consists of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all restaurants being measured by the number of restaurants being measured. Domestic AUV includes revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants. AUV allows management to assess our company-owned and franchised restaurant economics. Changes in AUV are primarily driven by increases in same store sales and are also influenced by opening new restaurants.    
  Same store sales.   Same store sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the same store base. We define the same store base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the     performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and closures. We review     same store sales for company-owned restaurants as well as system-wide restaurants. Same store sales are     driven by changes in transactions and average transaction size. Transaction size changes are driven by price changes or mix shifts from either a change in the number of items purchased or shifts into higher/lower priced categories of items.    
    
  Adjusted EBITDA.   We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for management fees and expense reimbursement,     transaction costs, gains and losses  
  
   12 

on the disposal of assets, stock-based compensation expense and management agreement termination fees. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see the table below. For further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures and how we utilize them see footnote 2 below. 
  The following table sets forth our key performance indicators as well as our total revenue and net income for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (dollars in thousands):  

(1) The percentage of system-wide sales attributable to company-owned restaurants was   3.4%   and   3.7%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and was   3.5%   and   3.9%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. The remainder was generated by franchised restaurants, as reported by our franchisees. 
  (2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  
  We define  EBITDA  as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. We define  Adjusted EBITDA  as EBITDA further adjusted for management fees and expense reimbursement, management agreement termination fees, transaction costs, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, and stock-based compensation expense. There were no gains and losses on disposal of assets during the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  . We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors  understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations period over period and would ordinarily add back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business.  
  Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:  
             
    as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our restaurants on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;  
                
    for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections;  
                
    to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies;  
                
    to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business; and  
                
    to calculate incentive compensation payments for our employees, including assessing performance under our annual incentive compensation plan and determining the vesting of performance shares.  
     By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors  understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors  
  
   13 

in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. Items excluded from these non-GAAP measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness use EBITDA (with additional adjustments) to measure our compliance with covenants such as fixed charge coverage, lease adjusted leverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations are:  
             
    such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  
                
    such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
                
    such measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;  
                
    such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;  
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and  
                
    other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.  
     Due to these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures only supplementally. As noted in the table below, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for transaction costs, gains and losses on disposal of assets and stock-based compensation, among other items. It is reasonable to expect that these items will occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our restaurants and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other restaurant companies over time. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for other items that we do not expect to regularly record, such as management fees and expense reimbursement. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation table below help management with a measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations.  
  The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (in thousands):  

(a) Represents a one-time fee of   $3.3 million   that was paid in consideration for the termination of our management agreement with Roark Capital Management, LLC during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 26, 2015  . 
  (b) Includes management fees and other out-of-pocket expenses paid to Roark Capital Management, LLC.  
  (c) Represents costs and expenses related to refinancings of our credit agreement and our public offerings; all transaction costs are included in SG A with the exception of   $215,000   that is included in Other expense, net during the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   $172,000   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 26, 2015  . 
  (d) Includes non-cash, stock-based compensation.

  The following table sets forth our results of operations for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1)    Exclusive of depreciation and amortization, shown separately. 
  Total revenue.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , total revenue was   $21.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.7 million  , or   14.0%  , compared to   $19.1 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Royalty revenue and franchise fees.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , royalty revenue and franchise fees were   $13.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.1 million  , or   17.9%  , compared to   $11.6 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . Royalty revenue   increased     $1.9 million   primarily due to   an increase   in the number of franchised restaurants from   788   at   September 26, 2015   to   929   at   September 24, 2016   and domestic same store sales growth of   4.1%  . Franchise fees   increased     $0.2 million   driven by   35   franchised restaurant openings during the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   27   franchise restaurant openings during the   thirteen weeks ended     September 26, 2015  .  
  Company-owned restaurant sales.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company-owned restaurant sales were   $8.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.6 million  , compared to   $7.5 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .   The increase   is the result of company-owned domestic same store sales growth of   4.8%   during the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and the addition of one company-owned restaurant opened during the second fiscal quarter of   2016  .   
  Cost of sales.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , cost of sales was   $6.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.8 million  , or   14.3%  , compared to   $5.3 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . Cost of sales as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales was   74.7%   in the quarter ended   September 24, 2016   compared to   70.7%   in the prior year.   

15 

The table below presents the major components of cost of sales (dollars in thousands):  

Food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   36.0%   in the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   35.8%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales is primarily due to a shift in product mix during the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  . This was partially offset by a   1.9%     decrease   in commodities rates for bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior year period. 
  Labor costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   23.7%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   20.7%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales is primarily due to investments in roster sizes and staffing to support the continued sales growth in our company-owned restaurants, as well as the ramp up of one company-owned restaurant that opened during the second fiscal quarter of   2016   as it gets to normal efficiency.  
  Other restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   17.6%   for the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   16.5%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales is primarily due to increased rent and repairs and maintenance expenses over the prior year associated with remodels as we continue to make investments for future growth.  
  For the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016   vendor rebates were   $0.2 million  , comparable to prior year. 
     Selling, general and administrative.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , SG A expense was   $8.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.6 million   compared to   $7.3 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase in SG A expense is primarily due to nonrecurring costs of   $1.4 million   related to the refinancing of our credit agreement and subsequent dividend payout completed during the current fiscal quarter, compared to no nonrecurring expenses in the prior year period.  
  Depreciation and amortization.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , depreciation expense was   $0.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.1 million  , or   17.3%  , compared to   $0.6 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . 
  Interest expense, net.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , interest expense was   $1.4 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.6 million  , or   73.8%  , compared to   $0.8 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase is primarily due to an increase in the principal amount of indebtedness and applicable interest rate related to the refinancing of our credit agreement in June 2016. 
  Other expense, net.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , other expense, net   increased     $0.1 million  , primarily attributable to   $215,000   of previously capitalized financing costs which were expensed in the current period as a result of the refinancing of our credit agreement in June 2016. The increase was offset by a change in the fair value of the interest rate cap in the prior year period, which was terminated in June 2016. 
  Income tax expense.   Income tax expense was   $1.7 million   in the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , yielding an annual effective tax rate of   37.6%  , comparable to an annual effective tax rate of   37.3%   in the prior year.

Segment results.   The following table sets forth our revenue and operating profit for each of our segments for the period presented (dollars in thousands):    

Franchise segment.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , franchise segment revenue was   $13.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.1 million  , or   17.9%  , compared to   $11.6 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   was due to   141   net franchise restaurant openings since   September 26, 2015   and domestic same store sales growth of   4.1%  . 
  During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , franchise segment profit was   $6.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.8 million  , or   39.4%  , compared to   $4.4 million   in the comparable period in   2015   primarily due to the growth in revenue.  
  Company segment.   During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company-owned restaurant sales were   $8.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.6 million  , compared to   $7.5 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   is primarily due to company-owned domestic same store sales growth of   4.8%   and the opening of one company-owned restaurant during the second fiscal quarter of   2016  . 
  During the   thirteen weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company segment profit was   $1.2 million  ,   a decrease   of   $0.2 million  , or   12.2%  , compared to   $1.4 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to investments in roster sizes and staffing to support the continued sales growth in our company-owned restaurants, and increases in rent and repairs and maintenance expenses as compared to the prior year period associated with remodels as we continue to make investments for future growth, offset by a   1.9%     decrease   in the commodities rates for bone-in chicken wings.

  The following table sets forth our results of operations for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1)    Exclusive of depreciation and amortization, shown separately. 
  Total revenue.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , total revenue was   $66.6 million  ,   an increase   of   $9.2 million  , or   16.1%  , compared to   $57.4 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Royalty revenue and franchise fees.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , royalty revenue and franchise fees were   $41.5 million  ,   an increase   of   $7.3 million  , or   21.4%  , compared to   $34.1 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . Royalty revenue   increased     $5.7 million   primarily due to   an increase   in the number of franchised restaurants from   788   at   September 26, 2015   to   929   at   September 24, 2016   and domestic same store sales growth of   3.9%  . Franchise fees   increased     $0.5 million   primarily due to fees recognized from the termination of franchise agreements, as well as an increase in store openings as compared to the prior year period. Other revenue   increased     $1.1 million   due to vendor contributions received for the franchisee convention. The convention is held every 18 months, and there was no convention in 2015. 
  Company-owned restaurant sales.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company-owned restaurant sales were   $25.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.9 million  , compared to   $23.2 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .   The increase   is the result of company-owned domestic same store sales growth of   6.9%   and the opening of   one   company-owned restaurant during the second fiscal quarter of   2016  . 
  Cost of sales.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , cost of sales was   $18.4 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.8 million  , or   10.7%  , compared to   $16.6 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . Cost of sales as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales was   73.0%   in the quarter ended   September 24, 2016   compared to   71.3%   in the prior year.   

18 

The table below presents the major components of cost of sales (dollars in thousands):  

Food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   37.2%   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   37.1%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   is primarily due to a   1.4%     increase   in commodities rates for bone-in chicken wings. 
  Labor costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   22.0%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   20.7%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales is primarily due to investments in roster sizes and staffing to support the continued sales growth in our company-owned restaurants, as well as the ramp up of one company-owned restaurant that opened during the second fiscal quarter of   2016   as it gets to normal efficiency.  
  Other restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were   16.7%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   compared to   15.8%   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales is primarily due to increased rent expense over the prior year, as well as pre-opening expenses associated with the opening of a new company-owned restaurant during the second fiscal quarter of   2016  .  
  Vendor rebates   increased     $0.2 million   primarily due to a vendor rebate received during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   related to the franchisee convention. 
     Selling, general and administrative.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , SG A expense was   $25.1 million  , a decrease of   $0.5 million   compared to   $25.7 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . SG A expense in the current period included nonrecurring costs of   $2.1 million   related to the refinancing of our credit agreement and the follow-on offerings, compared to nonrecurring expenses of   $5.5 million   in the prior year period, which included a one-time fee of   $3.3 million  , paid in consideration for the termination of our management agreement with Roark Capital Management,   $2.0 million   of nonrecurring costs associated with our preparation to become a public company, and   $0.2 million   of management fees paid to Roark Capital Management. The decrease in non-recurring costs in the current period was partially offset by   $1.1 million   of expenses related to the 2016 franchisee convention and increases related to headcount additions and other recurring costs associated with being a public company incurred in the current fiscal year. 
  Depreciation and amortization.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , depreciation expense was   $2.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.2 million  , or   12.5%  , compared to   $1.9 million   in the comparable period in   2015 
  Interest expense, net.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , interest expense was   $2.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.1 million  , or   3.4%  , compared to   $2.8 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The increase is primarily due to an increase in the principal amount of indebtedness and an increase in the applicable interest rate related to the refinancing of our credit agreement in June 2016. 
  Other expense, net.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , other expense, net   decreased     $0.1 million  , primarily attributable to a change in the fair value of the interest rate cap, which was terminated in June 2016. The decrease was partially offset by   $215,000   of previously capitalized financing costs which were expensed in the current period, compared to only   $172,000   in the prior period. 
  Income tax expense.   Income tax expense was   $6.7 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , yielding an annual effective tax rate of   37.6%  , comparable to an annual effective tax rate of   37.3%   in the prior year.

Segment results.   The following table sets forth our revenue and operating profit for each of our segments for the period presented (dollars in thousands):    

Franchise segment.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , franchise segment revenue was   $41.5 million  ,   an increase   of   $7.3 million  , or   21.4%  , compared to   $34.1 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   was due to   141   net franchise restaurant openings since   September 26, 2015  , domestic same store sales growth of   3.9%  , and vendor contributions of $0.9 million received for the franchisee convention.  
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , franchise segment profit was   $18.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $4.3 million  , or   29.4%  , compared to   $14.5 million   in the comparable period in   2015   primarily due to the growth in revenue.  
  Company segment.   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company-owned restaurant sales were   $25.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.9 million  , compared to   $23.2 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . The   increase   is primarily due to company-owned domestic same store sales growth of   6.9%   and the opening of   one   company-owned restaurant during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  .   
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , company segment profit was   $4.2 million  , comparable to prior year. An increase in company-owned same store sales of   6.9%   was primarily offset by a   1.4%     increase   in commodities rates for bone-in chicken wings and investments in roster sizes and staffing to support the continued sales growth in our company-owned restaurants, as well as the ramp up of one company-owned restaurant that opened during the second fiscal quarter of   2016   as it gets to normal efficiency.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  General.   Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and proceeds from the incurrence of debt. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital and general corporate needs. Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy. 
  The following table shows summary cash flows information for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   (in thousands):  

Operating activities  . Our cash flows from operating activities are principally driven by sales at both franchise restaurants and company-owned restaurants, as well as franchise and development fees. We collect franchise royalties from our franchise owners  
  
   20 

on a weekly basis. Restaurant-level operating costs at our company-owned restaurants, unearned franchise and development fees and corporate overhead costs also impact our cash flows from operating activities.  
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $15.1 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $7.2 million  , from   $7.9 million   in   2015   primarily due to an increase in net income from the prior period and working capital changes. 
  Investing activities  . Our net cash   used in   investing activities was   $1.5 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.1 million  , from   $1.3 million     used in   investing activities in   2015  . The   increase   was due to an increase in capital expenditures over the comparable period.   
  Financing activities  . Our net cash   used in   financing activities was   $20.5 million   in the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $9.9 million  , from cash   used in   financing activities of   $10.6 million   in   2015  . The increase was due to a dividend payout of   $83.3 million   to stockholders, compared to a dividend payout of   $48.0 million   in the prior period. This was partially offset by   $35.0 million   in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our IPO in the prior period. Additionally, cash proceeds from net borrowings were   $62.5 million   in the thirty-nine weeks ended   September 24, 2016  , compared to net borrowings of   $1.8 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . 
  Senior secured credit facility  . In   June 2016  , the Company entered into a   $180.0 million   new senior secured credit facility, which replaced the Company s second amended and restated credit facility dated March 18, 2015. In connection with the new senior secured credit facility, the facility size was increased to   $180.0 million   and is comprised of a   $70.0 million   term loan and a   $110.0 million   revolving credit facility. The previous credit facility included a term loan of   $85.5 million   and a revolving credit facility of   $5.0 million  . We used the proceeds from the new senior secured credit facility and cash on hand to refinance   $85.5 million   of indebtedness under the Company s   March 2015   credit facility and to pay a dividend of   $83.3 million   to our stockholders. Borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility bear interest, payable quarterly, at the base rate plus a margin (  1.00%   to   2.00%  , dependent on our reported leverage ratio) or LIBOR plus a margin (  2.00%   to   3.00%  , dependent on our reported leverage ratio), at the Company s discretion. The new senior secured credit facility also extended the maturity date from   March 2020   to   June 2021  . Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the ability to increase the size of the new senior secured credit facility by an additional   $30.0 million  .  
  We made principal prepayments of   $10.0 million   on our March 2015 credit facility and   $7.0 million   on our new senior secured credit facility in February 2016 and September 2016, respectively. As a result of the debt refinancing, principal installments for the new senior secured credit facility of   $875,000   are due quarterly with all unpaid amounts due at maturity in   June 2021  . 
  The new senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and requires compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage and leverage. We were in compliance with these covenants as of   September 24, 2016  . Failure to comply with these covenants in the future could cause an acceleration of outstanding amounts under the term loan and restrict us from borrowing under the revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity requirements.   
  Contractual Obligations 
  In connection with our new senior secured credit facility, principal payments of   $875,000   are due quarterly with all unpaid amounts due at maturity in   June 2021  . 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations as of   September 24, 2016  . 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are identified and described in our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Form 10-K, and there have been no material changes since the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K. 
  
   21 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  JOBS Act.   We qualify as an  emerging growth company  pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an  emerging growth company,  we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies,  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, reduced disclosure obligations relating to the presentation of financial statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory  say-on-pay  votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We have availed ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations and executive compensation disclosure in the Registration Statement, and expect to continue to avail ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations available to emerging growth companies in future filings. 
  In addition, an emerging growth company can delay its adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to  opt out  of this extended transition period, and as a result, we plan to comply with any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which non-emerging growth companies must adopt the standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 
  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This document contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future financial and operating performance and growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us.

    fluctuations in exchange rates on our revenue; 
                
    future impairment charges; 
                
    the concentration of ownership by our principal stockholder; and

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Impact of Inflation.     The primary inflationary factors affecting our and our franchisees  operations are food and beverage costs, labor costs, energy costs and the costs and materials used in the construction of new restaurants. Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits. Significant numbers of our and our franchisees  restaurant personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and/or state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage increase our and our franchisees  labor costs. To the extent permitted by competition and the economy, we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed through to our customers. Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  Commodity Price Risk.   We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. Many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather, production, availability and other factors outside our control. Although we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients, there are no established fixed price markets for bone-in chicken wings, so we are subject to prevailing market conditions. Bone-in chicken wings accounted for approximately   28.8%   and   29.2%   of our company-owned restaurant cost of sales during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, with an average price per pound of   $1.85   and   $1.83  , respectively. A hypothetical   10%   increase in the bone-in chicken wing costs would have increased costs of sales by approximately   $0.5 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 24, 2016  . We do not engage in speculative financial transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled, and are accounted for as normal purchases. 
  Interest Rate Risk.   We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, which bears interest at variable rates. As of   September 24, 2016  , we had   $158.0 million   outstanding under our credit facility. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from our variable rate debt obligations that are expected to remain outstanding. Interest rate changes do not affect the market value of such debt, but could impact the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. A hypothetical   1.0%   percentage point increase or decrease in the interest rate associated with our credit facilities would have resulted in a   $1.6 million   impact on interest expense on an annualized basis.  
  
   24 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 24, 2016  , pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  
  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There have been no other significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

25 

PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
   
  Item 1A.     Risk Factors 
  A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in the  Risk Factors  section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 26, 2015  . There have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as previously reported.
