NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.   Nature of Business  

GreeneStone Healthcare
Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Colorado, USA, on April 1, 1993. Effective
May 2012, the Company changed its corporate name to GreeneStone Healthcare Corporation from Nova Natural Resources Corporation.
As at September 30, 2016, the Company owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Greenstone Clinic Muskoka Inc., which was incorporated
in 2010 under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Greenstone Clinic Muskoka Inc. provides medical services to various
patients in clinics located in the regional municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. 

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim consolidated financial information and Rule 803 of Regulation SX. Accordingly, these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. 

All adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in these unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the three and nine month period presented are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015
has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

a)      Use
                                         of Estimates     

The preparation of unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

b)    Principals
                                         of consolidation and foreign currency translation    

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 

The Company s subsidiary s
functional currency is the Canadian dollar, while the Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. All transactions
initiated in Canadian dollars are translated into US dollars in accordance with ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Translation 
as follows: 

Monetary assets and liabilities
                                         at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.    

Equity at historical rates.    

Revenue and expense items
                                         at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period.    

Adjustments arising
from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders  deficit
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining
net income (loss) but reported as other comprehensive income (loss).

GREENESTONE HEALTHCARE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

For
foreign currency transactions, the Company translates these amounts to the Company s functional currency at the exchange
rate effective on the invoice date. If the exchange rate changes between the time of purchase and the time actual payment is made,
a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss results which is included in determining net income for the period.  

The relevant translation
rates are as follows: For the nine months ended September 30, 2016  a closing rate of CAD$1.0000 equals US$0.7624 and an
average exchange rate of CAD$1.0000 equals US$0.7663. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (continued)  

c)      Revenue
                                         Recognition     

The Company recognizes
revenue from the rendering of services when they are earned  specifically, when all of the following conditions are met: 

the
                                         significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to customers and the Company
                                         retains neither continuing involvement nor effective control     

there is clear evidence that
                                         an arrangement exists     

the amount of revenue and
                                         related costs can be measured reliably  and    

it is probable that the economic
                                         benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company.    

In particular, the Company recognizes: 

Fees
                                         for outpatient counselling, coaching, intervention, psychological assessments and other
                                         related services when patients receive the service  and    

Fees
                                         for inpatient addiction treatments proportionately over the term of the patient s
                                         treatment.    

Deferred revenue represents
monies deposited by the patients for future services to be provided by the Company. Such monies will be recognized into revenue
as the patient progresses through their treatment term. 

Other income includes proceed received on the sale of
mineral rights which are owned by the company in terms of the Company s  previous operations.  

d)    Cash
                                         and cash equivalents    

The Company's policy is
to disclose bank balances under cash, including bank overdrafts with balances that fluctuate frequently from being positive to
overdrawn and term deposits with a maturity period of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 

The Company has $76,240
(CAD$100,000) in restricted cash held by their bank to cover against the possibility of credit card charge backs, for services
not performed.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (continued)  

e)      Recent
                                         accounting pronouncements     

In June 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 will replace the current incurred
loss approach with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances
for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount under the current other-than-temporary impairment
model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, FASB issued
ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the effect ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 

In October 2016, Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany
asset transfers, other than inventory transfers.  Existing GAAP prohibits recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany
asset transfers whereby the seller defers any net tax effect and the buyer is prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset
on the difference between the newly created tax basis of the asset in its tax jurisdiction and its financial statement carrying
amount as reported in the consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2016-16 specifically excludes from its scope intercompany
inventory transfers whereby the recognition of tax consequences will take place when the inventory is sold to third parties. ASU
2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or
made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Any new accounting standards,
not disclosed above, that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. 

f)    Financial
                                         instruments    

The Company is exposed
to various risks through its financial instruments. The following analysis provides a measure of the Company s risk exposure
and concentrations at the balance sheet date, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

i.        Credit risk      

Credit risk is the risk
that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. 

Credit risk associated
with accounts receivable of GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. is mitigated due to balances from many customers, as well as through
credit checks and frequent reviews of receivables to ensure timely collection. In addition, there is no concentration risk with
the GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. accounts receivable balance since balances are due from many customers. 

In the opinion of management, credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable is assessed as low, not material and remains  unchanged from the prior year.

f)      Financial
                                         instruments (continued)     

ii.        Liquidity
                                         risk      

Liquidity risk is the
risk the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company is exposed to liquidity risk
through its working capital deficiency of $(3,080,400) and accumulated deficit of $(20,371,819). As disclosed in note 3, the Company
will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital in order to implement its business plan. There is no assurance that the
Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse
effect on the Company s financial condition. In the opinion of management, liquidity risk is assessed as high, material
and remains unchanged from the prior year. 

iii.        Market
                                         risk      

 Market risk is the risk
that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market
risk comprises of three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, and other price risk. The Company is exposed to interest
rate risk and currency risk. 

iv.     Interest rate risk    

Interest rate risk is
the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
rates. The Company is exposed to minimal interest rate risk on its bank indebtedness as there is a balance of $7,144 as of September
30, 2016. This liability is based on floating rates of interest that have been stable during the current reporting period. In
the opinion of management, interest rate risk is assessed as low, not material and remains unchanged from the prior year. 

v.     Currency risk    

Currency risk is the risk
that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Company is subject to currency risk as its subsidiaries operate in Canada and are subject to fluctuations in the Canadian
dollar. Most of the Company s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars. Based on the net exposures
at September 30, 2016, a 5% depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would result in an approximate
$17,469 increase or decrease in the Company s after tax net income from operations. The Company has not entered into any
hedging agreements to mediate this risk. In the opinion of management, currency risk is assessed as low, material and remains
unchanged from the prior year. 

vi.     Other price risk    

Other price risk is the
risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other
than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual
financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. In the opinion
of management, the Company is not exposed to this risk and remains unchanged from the prior year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

3.   Going Concern  

The Company s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP applicable to a going concern, which
assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations in the normal course of business. As
at September 30, 2016 the Company has a working capital deficiency of $(3,080,400) and accumulated deficit of $(20,371,819). Management
believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company s planned expenditures, including past
due payroll and sales tax payments, as well as estimated penalties and interest, over the next 12 months. Accordingly, the Company
will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of common shares, and, or debt financing in order to
implement its business plan, and, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. If the Company raises additional capital
through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes.
If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt
covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic
partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain geographical areas, or techniques that it might otherwise
seek to retain. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to
secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue operations. 

The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock or obtaining debt
financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management's plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt
financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations  however, there can be no assurance the Company will be
successful in these efforts. 

4.      Due from sale of subsidiary  

A net amount of CAD$617,960 is due to the Company on the sale
of the Endoscopy Clinic in December 2014. This debt is in the form of an interest bearing note with a coupon of 5% per annum.

Contingency
related to outstanding tax liabilities:   

  The
Company is delinquent in filing previous payroll tax returns resulting in taxes, interest and penalties payable at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 as part of Taxes Payable, the Company has tax liabilities
of approximately $2,530,946 and $2,490,506, respectively due to various taxing authorities on the consolidated balance sheets.
If the Company does not satisfy these liabilities, the taxing authorities may place liens on its bank accounts which would have
a negative impact on its ability to operate. Further, the actual liability may be higher due to interest or penalties assessed
by the taxing authorities.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table summarizes working capital at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company borrowed $200,000 in short term loans to fund working capital requirements as revenue continues to grow over prior
periods. This loan is repayable in 5 months, therefore over the next twelve months we estimate that the company will require
approximately $3.15 million to cover the working capital deficit and properly market and promote the company. The company will
have to raise equity or secure debt. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing
ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
condition. In the opinion of management, the Company s liquidity risk is assessed as high and remains unchanged from
the prior year.

                                         and
