Note 1. Overview and   Basis of Presentation   
 Description of Business and Separation 
   
 Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. ( Donnelley Financial,   the Company  and  we ) is a financial communications services company that supports global capital markets compliance and transaction needs for its corporate clients and their advisors (such as law firms and investment bankers) and global investment markets compliance and analytics needs for mutual fund companies, variable annuity providers and broker/dealers. With proprietary technology such as data storage and workflow collaboration tools, deep subject matter expertise and a global footprint, Donnelley Financial produces, manages, stores, distributes and translates documents and electronic communications in order to deliver timely financial communications to investors and documents in a manner that complies with regulatory commissions. 
 Donnelley Financial s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended ( Form 10), was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on September 20, 2016. On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by R.R. Donnelley   Sons Company ( RRD ) of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders (the  Separation ). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock, or a 19.25% interest in Donnelley Financial, as part of the Separation, but expects to dispose of the common stock that it retained in the 12-month period following the Separation. Donnelley Financial s common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol  DFIN  on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. ( LSC ), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. 
 The Company and LSC entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with RRD to effect the distribution of the Company s and LSC s common stock to R.R. Donnelley s common stockholders. This agreement governs the Company s relationship with RRD and LSC with respect to pre-Separation matters and provides for the allocation of employee benefit, litigation and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Separation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also includes an agreement that the Company, RRD and LSC will provide each other with appropriate indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the businesses being distributed and retained by RRD in the Separation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also addresses employee compensation and benefit matters. 
 In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into transition services agreements separately with RRD and LSC, under which, in exchange for the fees specified in the arrangements, RRD and LSC agree to provide certain services to the Company and the Company agrees to provide certain services to RRD, respectively, for up to 24 months following the Separation. These services include, but are not limited to, information technology, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll and other financial and administrative services and functions.  These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing the Company to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office systems across its organization.    
 The Company entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with RRD and its subsidiaries. These include, among other things, arrangements for the provision of services, including global outsourcing and logistics services, printing and binding, digital printing, composition and access to technology. The Company also entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with LSC and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which LSC will print and bind products for the Company. The terms of the arrangements with RRD and LSC do not exceed 24 months. Subsequent to the Separation, RRD and LSC are clients of the Company and expect to utilize financial communication software and services that the Company provides to all of its clients. 
 Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from RRD s consolidated financial statements and accounting records.  The unaudited condensed combined financial statements include the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.

 Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. 
 Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Financial Statements 
  (in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated) 

The financial data presented herein is unaudited and should be read i  n conjunction with the audited combined finan  cial   statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Form 10. In the opinion of management, the financial data presented includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations a  nd cash flows for the interim periods presented.  Results of interim periods should not be considered indicative of the results of the full year.   These unaudited condensed combined interim financial statements include estimates and assumptions of managemen  t that affect the amounts reported in the   unaudited   condensed combined financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
   The unaudited condensed combined financial statements include the allocation of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the RRD corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or attributable to the Company.  Cash and cash equivalents held by RRD were not allocated to Donnelley Financial unless they were held in a legal entity that was transferred to Donnelley Financial. All intercompany transactions and accounts within Donnelley Financial have been eliminated. All intracompany transactions between RRD and Donnelley Financial are considered to be effectively settled in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements at the time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intracompany transactions is reflected in the unaudited condensed combined statements of cash flows as a financing activity and in the unaudited condensed combined balance sheets as net parent company investment. Net parent company investment is primarily impacted by contributions from RRD which are the result of treasury activities and net funding provided by or distributed to RRD.    
 The unaudited condensed combined financial statements include certain expenses of RRD which were allocated to Donnelley Financial for certain functions, including general corporate expenses related to information technology, finance, legal, human resources, internal audit, treasury, tax, investor relations and executive oversight.  These expenses have been allocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage, when available, with the remainder allocated on the pro rata basis of revenue, employee headcount, or other measures. We consider the expense methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented.  However these allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred as an independent public company or the costs that may be incurred in the future. 
 The income tax amounts in these unaudited condensed combined financial statements have been calculated based on a separate income tax return methodology and presented as if the Company s operations were separate taxpayers in the respective jurisdictions.  
 RRD maintains various benefit and share-based compensation plans at a corporate level.  Donnelley Financial employees participated in those programs and a portion of the cost of those plans is included in Donnelley Financial s unaudited condensed combined financial statements.  However, Donnelley Financial s unaudited condensed combined balance sheets do not include any equity related to share-based compensation plans.  On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. Refer to Note 5,  Retirement Plans , for further details regarding the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Refer to Note 6,  Share Based Compensation , for further details regarding the Company s share-based compensation plans. 
   
 Donnelley Financial generates a portion of net revenue from sales to RRD s subsidiaries. Included in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements are net revenues from intercompany sales of $1.1 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and $3.6 million and $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Donnelley Financial utilizes RRD for freight and logistics, production of certain printed products and outsourced business services functions. Included in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements are cost of sales to RRD and affiliates of $20.2 million and $22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and $78.0 million and $89.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  Intercompany receivables and payables with RRD are reflected within net parent company investment in the accompanying unaudited condensed combined financial statements. See Note   13,  Related Parties,  for a further description of related party transactions.

The following table outlines the estimated annual amortization expense related to other intangible assets as of September 30, 2016:  

Note 5. Retirement Plans  
 Donnelley Financial s Pension Plans    
 RRD maintained a defined benefit plan (the  plan ) for certain current and former U.S. employees of RRD. Effective December 31, 2013, RRD merged the plan into a separate defined benefit pension plan for Donnelley Financial to create a combined defined benefit pension plan (the  combined plan ). During 2015, the sponsorship of the combined plan was transferred to RRD, which became the legal obligor of the combined plan. Accordingly, the obligations of the combined plan are not reflected in the condensed combined balance sheet of Donnelley Financial as of December 31, 2015.  
 The components of the estimated net pension plan expense (income) for Donnelley Financial s pension plans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:     

On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. The Company s primary defined benefit plan is frozen. No new employees will be permitted to enter the Company s frozen plan and participants will earn no additional benefits. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation. These defined benefit retirement income plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations. The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all funded plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations. 
 Donnelley Financial s Participation in RRD s Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 
 RRD provided pension and other postretirement healthcare benefits to certain current and former employees of Donnelley Financial.  Prior to the Separation, RRD was responsible for the net benefit plan obligations associated with these plans, and as such, these liabilities are not reflected in Donnelley Financial s condensed combined balance sheets.

 Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. 
 Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Financial Statements 
  (in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated) 

Donnelley Financial s   condensed   combined statements of operations include expense allocations for these benefits.   These allocations w  ere funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within net parent company investment in Donnelley Financial.   Total RRD pension and postretirement benefit plan net income allocated to Donnelley Financial, related to pension cost an  d postretirement benefits, was $  1.3   million and $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 201  6 and 2015, respectively, and $  4.2   million and $  3.0   million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in these is an   allocation for other postretirement benefit plans for $  0.3   million and $0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $  1.0   million and $1.  5   million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    These allocations are reflected in the Company s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.    

Note 6. Share Based Compensation  
 RRD maintained an incentive stock program for the benefit of its officers, directors and certain employees, including certain Donnelley Financial employees.  The following disclosures represent the portion of RRD s program in which Donnelley Financial s employees and directors participated.  RRD s share-based compensation programs in which Donnelley Financial employees participated included restricted stock units ( RSUs ).   
 Share-based compensation expense includes expense attributable to the Company based on the award terms previously granted to the Company s employees and an allocation of compensation expense for RRD s corporate and shared functional employees.  As the share-based compensation plans are RRD s plans, the amounts have been recognized through net parent company investment on the condensed combined balance sheets.  Total compensation expense related to all share based compensation plans was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 In connection with the Separation, as of October 1, 2016 employee stock options and restricted stock units were adjusted and converted into new equity awards using a 10-day volume weighted average share price of Donnelley Financial, RRD and  LSC, as described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Upon the Separation on October 1, 2016, holders of certain RRD stock options and RSUs received awards in Donnelley Financial, RRD and LSC pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Converted awards retained the same vesting schedule and expiration date of the original awards. 
 On October 1, 2016, the Company awarded 156,169 shares of restricted stock and 60,748 RSUs to certain employees under the Donnelley Financial Solutions Performance Incentive Plan. 50% of each of the awards of restricted stock and RSUs will vest two years from the grant date and 50% will vest three years from the grant date. Vesting of the restricted stock awards is also subject to performance metrics. Both the restricted stock and RSU awards are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment prior to vesting, subject in some cases to early vesting upon specified events, including death or permanent disability of the grantee, termination of the grantee s employment under certain circumstances or a change in control of the Company. On October 1, 2016, the Company also granted 16,620 restricted stock units to members of the Board of Directors, as a pro-rata portion of their annual equity retainer. 

Note 7. Equity  
 The Company s equity as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as follows:

Refer to Note 11,   Debt  , for further details regarding these transactions.   
 The Company s equity as of December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were as follows:  

Note 8. Earnings per Share  
 On October 1, 2016, RRD distributed approximately 26.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders in connection with the spin-off of Donnelley Financial, with RRD retaining approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock. Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per common share and the average number of common shares outstanding were retrospectively restated for the number of Donnelley Financial shares outstanding immediately following this transaction. The same number of shares was used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share since there were no Donnelley Financial equity awards outstanding prior to the spin-off.  

Note 9. Comprehensive Income

Note 11. Debt  
 On September 30, 2016, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a $350.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the  Term Loan Credit Facility ) and a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Facility,  and, together with the Term Loan Credit Facility, the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $15.0 million in aggregate. As of September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. 
 On September 30, 2016, also in connection with the Separation, the Company issued $300.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024 (the  Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2017. The issuance of the Notes was part of a debt exchange that resulted in the settlement of certain of RRD's bonds.   Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Facility were used to provide $340.2 million of cash to RRD, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, as of September 30, 2016. The remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. 
 In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes which will have terms identical in all material respects to the Notes except that the registered notes will not contain terms that provide for restrictions on transfer, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC by June 27, 2017. In certain circumstances, the Company may be required to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the resale of the Notes by the holders thereof, in lieu of an exchange offer to such holders. The Company will be required to pay specified additional interest on the Notes if it fails to comply with its registration obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company settled an intercompany note payable with RRD. Refer to Note 13,  Related Parties  for further details.

The Company s debt as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

The fair value of the senior notes, which was determined using the market approach based upon interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar terms and maturities, were determined to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the Company s debt was equivalent to its book value. 

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies  
 Litigation  
 From time to time, the Company s customers and others file voluntary petitions for reorganization under United States bankruptcy laws. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company from these parties could be considered preference items and subject to return. In addition, the Company may be party to certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the final resolution of these preference items and litigation will not have a material effect on the Company s combined results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

Note 13.  Related Parties  
 Transition Services Agreements 
 In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into transition services agreements separately with RRD and LSC, under which, in exchange for the fees specified in the arrangements, RRD and LSC agree to provide certain services to the Company and the Company agrees to provide certain services to RRD, respectively, for up to 24 months following the Separation. These services include, but are not limited to, information technology, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll and other financial and administrative services and functions.  These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing the Company to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office systems across its organization.    
 Commercial Arrangements 
 The Company entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with RRD and its subsidiaries. These include, among other things, arrangements for the provision of services, including global outsourcing and logistics services, printing and binding, digital printing, composition and access to technology. The Company also entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with LSC and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which LSC will print and bind products for the Company. The terms of the arrangements with RRD and LSC do not exceed 24 months. Subsequent to the Separation, RRD and LSC are clients of the Company and expect to utilize financial communication software and services that the Company provides to all of its clients.

Stockholder and Registrati  on Rights Agreement  
 The Company and RRD entered into a Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Company s common stock retained by RRD pursuant to which the Company agrees that, upon the request of RRD, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of the shares of the Company s common stock retained by RRD after the Separation. In addition, RRD granted the Company a proxy to vote the shares of the Company s common stock that RRD retained immediately after the Separation in proportion to the votes cast by the Company s other stockholders. This proxy, however, will be automatically revoked as to a particular share upon any sale or transfer of such share from RRD to a person other than RRD, and neither the voting agreement nor the proxy will limit or prohibit any such sale or transfer. 
 Allocations from RRD 
 RRD provided Donnelley Financial with certain services, which include, but are not limited to information technology, finance, legal, human resources, internal audit, treasury, tax, investor relations and executive oversight. The financial information in these condensed combined financial statements does not necessarily include all the expenses that would have been incurred had Donnelley Financial been a separate, standalone entity for all periods presented. RRD charges Donnelley Financial for these services based on direct usage when possible. When specific identification is not practicable, the pro rata basis of revenue or employee headcount, or some other measure is used. These allocations were reflected as follows in the condensed combined financial statements:  

The Company considers the expense methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented.  However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that the Company would have incurred as an independent public company or the costs it may incur in the future.

Share-Based Compensation  
 Certain Donnelley Financial employees participate in RRD s share-based compensation plans, the costs  of which have been allocated to Donnelley Financial and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the  condensed  combined statements of operations. Share-based compensation costs allocated to the Company were  $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and  $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended  September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Retirement Plans  
 Donnelley Financial employees participated in pension and other postretirement plans sponsored by RRD.  These costs are reflected in the Company s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed combined statements of operations.  These costs were funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within the net parent company investment.     
 On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. Refer to Note 5 , Retirement Plans , for further details regarding the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 RRD uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations.  The majority of the Company s foreign subsidiaries were party to RRD s international cash pooling arrangements to maximize the availability of cash for general operating and investing purposes.  As part of RRD s centralized cash management process, cash balances were swept regularly from the Company s accounts.  Cash transfers to and from RRD s cash concentration accounts and the resulting balances at the end of each reporting period are reflected in net parent company investment in the  condensed  combined balance sheets.   
 In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, there will be a cash adjustment payable to or receivable from RRD for the September 30, 2016 cash balance greater or less than an agreed-upon target cash balance of $50.0 million as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The Separation and Distribution  A greement also includes a provision for RRD to make a future cash payment of $68.0 million to Donnelley Financial no later than April 1, 2017.  The $68.0 million receivable was recorded as of October 1, 2016. 
 Debt 
   
 RRD s third party debt and related interest expense have not been allocated to the Company for any of the periods presented as the Company was not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings were not directly related to the Company s business. An intercompany note payable with RRD at December 31, 2015 is presented in the accompanying condensed combined balance sheets. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a $29.6 million non-cash settlement related to this intercompany note payable. 

Note 14. New Accounting Pronouncements   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )  issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to put most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expense on the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, ASU 2016-02 also modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective in the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted; however the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which o  utlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue using a five-step process that supersedes virtually all existing revenue guidance. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. In August 2  015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to January 1, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2014-  09 is permitted in the first quarter of 2017.  However, the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The standard allows the option of either a full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented,   or a modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and currently anticipates applying the modified retrospective approach when adoptin  g the standard.   
 The following standards were effective for and adopted by the Company in 2016. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 Company Overview 
   
 Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. ( Donnelley Financial,  the  Company ) is an industry leading financial communications and data services company that supports global capital markets compliance and transaction needs for its corporate clients and their advisors (such as law firms and investment bankers) and global investment management compliance and analytics needs for mutual fund companies, variable annuity providers and broker/dealers. The Company provides content management, multi-channel content distribution, data management and analytics services, collaborative workflow and business reporting tools, and translations and other language services in support of its clients  communications requirements. The Company operates in two business segments:  

United States  . The United States segment is comprised of three reporting units: capital markets, investment markets, and language solutions and other. The Company services capital market and investment market clients in the United States by delivering products and services to help create, manage and deliver financial communications to investors and regulators. The Company provides capital market and investment market clients with communication tools and services to allow them to comply with their ongoing regulatory filings. In addition, the U.S. segment provides clients with communications services to create, manage and deliver registration statements, prospectuses, proxies and other communications to regulators and investors. The U.S. segment also includes language solutions and commercial printing capabilities.      

International  . The International segment includes operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Canada. The international business is primarily focused on working with international capital markets clients on capital markets offerings and regulatory compliance related activities within the United States. In addition, the International segment provides services to international investment market clients to allow them to comply with applicable SEC regulations, as well as language solutions to international clients.     

Corporate.   The Company reports certain unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses within Corporate, including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications and certain facility costs. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and are not allocated to the reportable segments. Prior to the Separation, many of these costs were based on allocations from RR Donnelley   Sons Company ( RRD  however, beginning October 1, 2016, the Company will incur such costs directly.      

 Products and Services 
 The Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its products and services offerings. The Company s services offerings consist of all non-print offerings, including document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, data and analytics, content storage services and language solutions. The Company s product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.  
 Spin-off Transaction 
 On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders (the  Separation ). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock, or a 19.25% interest in Donnelley Financial, as part of the Separation, but expects to dispose of the common stock that it retained in the 12-month period following the Separation. Donnelley Financial s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended ( Form 10), was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on September 20, 2016. Donnelley Financial s common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol  DFIN  on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. ( LSC ), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. 
 Executive Overview 
 Third Quarter Overview 
 Net sales decreased by $7.2 million, or 3.1%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. There was a $1.1 million, or 0.5%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, the decrease in net sales was due to lower capital markets transactions and compliance volume, partially offset by an increase in virtual data room and translation services. 
 20 

On September   30, 2016,   in connection with the Separation,   the Company entered into a $350.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the  Term Loan Credit Facility ) and a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility     (the    Revolving Facility,      and, toget  her with the Term Loan Credit Facility, the  Credit Agreement   )  .     On September 30, 2016, also in connection with the Separation, the Company issued $300.0 million of   8.25%   senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024.   The issuance of the notes was part of a   debt exchange that resulted in the settlement of certain of RRD's bonds.     Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Facility were used to provide $  340.  2   million of cash to RRD, pursuant to the Separation agreement, as of September 30, 2016.  
 On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. Refer to Note 5,  Retirement Plans , to the Condensed Combined Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 
 Non-GAAP Measures  
 The Company believes that certain Non-GAAP measures, such as Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, provide useful information about the Company s operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company s financial performance.  The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business.  Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company s core business operating results over different periods of time.  The Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales, the Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring, impairment and other charges-net.  A reconciliation of GAAP net earnings to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for these adjustments is presented in the following table: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 
 2016 Restructuring, impairment and other charges net .   The three months ended September 30, 2016 included $1.3 million for employee termination costs and $0.4 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs.  
   
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 2015 Restructuring, impairment and other charges net .   The three months ended September 30, 2015 included $0.9 million for employee termination costs and $0.5 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs.  
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
 2016 Restructuring, impairment and other charges net .   The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $2.3 million for employee termination costs, $1.2 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.1 million for other charges associated with the Company s decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.  
 21 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 2015 Restructuring, impairment and other charges net .   The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $1.7 million for employee termination costs, $1.5 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.1 million for other charges associated with the Company s decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.  
 OUTLOOK 
 Competition  
 Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data hosting of media content and advances in technology, continue to impact the market for our products and services. One of the Company s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products, compliance services and technologies, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients.  
 The financial communications services industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation.   Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation.  
 The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products, most acutely in the Company s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings.  Historically, the Company has been a high-touch, service oriented business. Technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves through collaborative document management solutions.  For years, the Company has invested in its own applications, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc and Venue to serve clients and increase retention and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including acquisitions of EDGAR Online and MultiCorpora and investments in Mediant, Peloton and eBrevia that further solidify the Company s position as a technology service leader in the industry.   
 The Company s competitors for SEC filing services for capital markets clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company s competitors for SEC filing services for investment markets clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.    Language solutions competes with global and local language service providers and language/globalization software vendors.  
 Market Volatility/Cyclicality  
 The Company is subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional offering is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and additional miscellaneous transactions. The Company mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, like document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process, and also moving upstream from the filing process with products like Venue, the Company s data room solution. The Company also attempts to balance this volatility through supporting the quarterly/annual public company reporting process through its EDGAR filing services and ActiveDisclosure product, its investment markets regulatory and shareholder communications offering and continues to expand into adjacent growth businesses like language solutions and data and analytics, which have recurring revenues and are not as susceptible to market volatility and cycles. This quarterly/annual public company reporting process work also subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year that have operational implications. Such operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring additional full-time and temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff, and outsourcing production for a number of services. The International segment is particularly susceptible to capital market volatility as most of the International business is capital markets transaction focused. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and FundSuiteArc solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients  ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company continues to remain focused on driving recurring revenue in order to mitigate market volatility.

Raw Materials   
 The primary raw materials used in the Company s printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink supply is sourced from a small set of select suppliers in order to ensure quality consistency that meets the Company s performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the business.  
 Financial Review 
 In the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its condensed combined results of operations, cash flows and certain other information. The Company has not previously operated as an independent, stand-alone company, but rather as a part of RRD. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company s business was previously part of a larger organization. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed combined financial statements and the related notes.

Depreciation and amortization included $3.6 million and $3.9 million of amortization of other intangible assets related to customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $10.2 million, or 36.2%, to $18.0 million versus the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to lower capital markets transactions, capital markets compliance and mutual funds print volume and an increase in selling expenses and costs related to the Separation, partially offset by an increase in virtual data room and translation services.  

Net interest expense decreased $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily due to the settlement of an intercompany note payable during the third quarter of 2016. 

The effective income tax rate was 43.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 39.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The September 30, 2016 effective income tax rate reflected additional tax reserves and accrual of interest.

 Products cost of sales decreased $7.4 million, or 3.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus the same period in the prior year. Products cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower print volumes and cost control initiatives, partially offset by wage and other inflationary increases.

 26 

Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   $  5.6   million, or   3.7%  , to   $  156.8   million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in selling expenses and   consulting,   information technology and employee costs   related   to the Separation.

 U.S. segment income from operations decreased $28.6 million, or 22.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to decreases in capital markets volumes, price pressures in investment markets and wage and other inflation, partially offset by an increase in virtual data room, translation and mutual fund content management services and cost control initiatives. 
 Operating margins decreased from 18.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 15.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to unfavorable mix driven by lower capital markets transactions, partially offset by cost control initiatives.      
   
 International  

Net sales for the International segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $100.1 million, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 7.9%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 including a $3.4 million, or 3.1%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

 International segment income from operations decreased $2.8 million, or 28.0%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the decline in capital markets transactions and compliance volumes and wage and other inflation increases, partially offset by cost control initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense. 
 Operating margins decreased from 9.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 7.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower capital markets transactions, partially offset by cost control initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense.  
 28 

Corporate   
 The following table summarizes unallocated operating expenses and certain items impacting comparability within the activities presented as Corporate:  

Corporate operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.7 million versus the same period in 2015 due to an increase in costs related to the Separation and an increase in bad debt expense. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 Prior to the Separation, RRD provided financing, cash management and other treasury services to Donnelley Financial. The Company s cash balances were swept by RRD and the Company received funding from RRD for operating and investing needs. Cash transferred to and from RRD has been recorded as intercompany payables and receivables which are reflected in the net parent company investment in the condensed combined financial statements. Subsequent to the Separation, the Company no longer participates in cash management and funding arrangements with RRD. 
   
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its shareholders. Cash on hand, operating cash flows and the Company s $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Facility ) are the primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company s debt obligations, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth, acquisitions, completion of restructuring programs and distributions to shareholders. 
 The following describes the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Cash Flows From Operating Activities  
 Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company s services and products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for labor, rent, raw materials and other operating activities. Allocations of operating expenses from RRD are also reflected as operating cash inflows or outflows, including those for pension costs and current income taxes payable.  
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $56.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $59.0 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected a decrease in pension plan income allocations and timing of payments for employee-related liabilities and suppliers, partially offset by timing of cash collections. 
 Cash Flows Used For Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was $17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.9 million for the same period in 2015.  Capital expenditures were $14.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2.9 million as compared to the same period of 2015. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included $3.5 million used for the purchase of investments. 
 Cash Flows Used For Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.1 million compared to $54.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities reflected $348.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, offset by a $315.3 million increase in net transfers to RRD and its affiliates in connection with the Separation.  
 29 

Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies  
 In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into transition services agreements with RRD, covering certain support and back office services that the Company has historically received from RRD. Under the terms of the agreements, RRD will provide various services, including information technology, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll and other financial and administrative services and functions. The Company also entered into a transition services agreement with LSC, pursuant to which LSC will provide certain services to the Company. The services under the transition services agreements generally extend for up to 24 months following the Separation. 
 The Company entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with RRD and its subsidiaries. These include, among other things, arrangements for the provision of services, including global outsourcing and logistics services, printing and binding, digital printing, composition and access to technology. The Company also entered into a number of commercial and other arrangements with LSC and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which LSC will print and bind products for the Company. The terms of the arrangements with RRD and LSC do not exceed 24 months.  
 In connection with the Separation, the Company assumed an operating lease through 2024 for the Company s headquarters, with a total commitment of $14.1 million at October 1, 2016.  There is a related non-cancelable sublease rental to RRD of approximately $6.2 million for the same period.  The Company remains secondarily liable under this lease in the event that the sub-lessee defaults under the sublease terms. The Company does not believe that material payments will be required as a result of the secondary liability provisions of the primary lease agreement. 
 See discussion in Liquidity related to the Company's debt obligations. 
 Liquidity 
 On September 30, 2016, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a $350.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the  Term Loan Credit Facility ) and the Revolving Facility.   
 On September 30, 2016, also in connection with the Separation, the Company issued $300.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024 (the  Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2017. The issuance of the Notes was part of a debt exchange that resulted in the settlement of certain of RRD's bonds.   Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Facility were used to provide $340.2 million of cash to RRD, pursuant to the Separation agreement, as of September 30, 2016. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ). The Company will be required to pay specified additional interest on the Notes if it fails to comply with its registration obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. 
 In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, there will be a cash adjustment payable to or receivable from RRD for the September 30, 2016 cash balance greater or less than an agreed-upon target cash balance of $50.0 million as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The Separation and Distribution  A greement also includes a provision for RRD to make a future cash payment of $68.0 million to Donnelley Financial no later than April 1, 2017.   
 The Company s debt maturities as of September 30, 2016 are shown in the table below: 

(a)   
 
 Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.0 million and a discount of $1.8 million which do not represent contractual commitments with a fixed amount or maturity date.     

(b)   
 
 Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.7 million which do not represent contractual commitments with a fixed amount or maturity date.     

 The Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $15.0 million in aggregate.  
 30 

The Notes are also subject to a number of covena  nts   that restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, make dividend payments and other distributions, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. In addition,   many of the restrictive covenants will not apply to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard   Poor s Ratings Services   (   S P ) and Moody s Investor Services, Inc. ( Moody s ),   or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by the Company, provided at such time no default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, $300.0 million of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement. 
 The failure of a financial institution supporting the Revolving Facility would reduce the size of the Company s committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. Currently, the Revolving Facility is supported by seventeen U.S. and international financial institutions.  
   
 The Company s liquidity may be affected by its credit ratings. The Company s S P and Moody s credit ratings as of September 30, 2016 are shown in the table below:

Cash and cash equivalents of $53.0 million at September 30, 2016 included $27.4 million in the U.S. and $25.6 million at international locations. The Company has not recognized deferred tax liabilities related to taxes on foreign earnings as foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Certain cash balances of foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. or local country taxes if repatriated to the U.S. In addition, repatriation of some foreign cash balances is further restricted by local laws. Management regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws, or the Company s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati  ve Disclosures About Market Risk  
 Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The Company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions concerning liquidity and capital resources. 
 Credit Risk 
 The Company is exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable balances. This risk is mitigated due to the Company s large, diverse customer base, dispersed over various geographic regions and industrial sectors. No single customer comprised more than 10% of the Company s combined net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company maintains provisions for potential credit losses and such losses to date have normally been within the Company s expectations. The Company evaluates the solvency of its customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable need to be recorded. Significant economic disruptions or a slowdown in the economy could result in significant additional charges. 
 Commodities 
 The primary raw materials used by the Company are paper and ink. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, the Company has incorporated price adjustment clauses in certain sales contracts. Management believes a hypothetical 10% change in the price of paper and other raw materials would not have a significant effect on the Company s combined annual results of operations or cash flows as these costs are generally passed through to its customers. However, such an increase could have an impact on our customers  demand for printed products, and we are not able to quantify the impact of such potential change in demand on our combined annual results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a)   
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures.     

 Management, together with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

(b)   
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting.     

 Under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Donnelley Financial is not required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017. In its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017, management and the Company s independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an assessment as to the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company completed preparations and implementations for a series of changes to its information technology environment, which includes financial reporting systems, to support its separate financial reporting requirements. There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that had materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 THIS AGREEMENT  (this  Agreement ) is entered into, effective as of _________________, 2016, between Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and ___________ ( Indemnitee ).  
 WHEREAS,  it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors the most capable persons available;  
 WHEREAS,  Indemnitee is a director of the Company;  
 WHEREAS,  both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims currently being asserted against directors of corporations; and  
 WHEREAS,  in recognition of Indemnitee s need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee s continued and effective service to the Company, and in order to induce Indemnitee to provide continued services to the Company as a director, the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement and for the coverage of Indemnitee under the Company s directors  and officers  liability insurance policies.  
 NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the above premises and of Indemnitee s continuing to serve as a director of the Company and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
 1.   Certain Definitions  :  
 (a)   Board  :  The Board of Directors of the Company.    
 (b)   Change in Control  :    
   (i)   any  person,  as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), as modified and used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) thereof (but not including (a) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (c) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (d) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company) (hereinafter a  Person ) is or becomes the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its affiliates, excluding an acquisition resulting from the exercise of a conversion or exchange privilege in respect of   

outstanding convertible or exchangeable securities) representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding securities; or   
 (ii)   during any period of two consecutive years beginning on the date hereof, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director designated by a Person who has entered into any agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Clause (i), (iii) or (iv) of this Section) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (each such director, a  Continuing Director ), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or  
 (iii)   the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than (a) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or acquiring entity), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, at least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving or acquiring entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (b) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person acquires more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or  
 (iv)   the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company s assets.  
 (c)   Disinterested Director  :  A director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee.  
 (d)   Expenses  :  Any reasonable expense, including without limitation, attorneys  fees, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees and expenses of experts, including accountants and other advisors, travel expenses, duplicating costs, postage, delivery service fees, filing fees, and all other disbursements or expenses of the types typically paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing, in any Proceeding (including Indemnitee s counterclaims that directly respond to and negate the affirmative claim made against Indemnitee ( Permitted Counterclaims ) in such Proceeding), but shall exclude the costs of (a) any of Indemnitee s counterclaims, other than Permitted Counterclaims, (b) the costs of acquiring and maintaining an appeal or supersedeas bond or similar instrument or (c) the fees and costs of enforcing a right to indemnification or advance payment or reimbursement under any of Sections 2, 4 or 5 of this Agreement, in each case, to the extent reasonable.  
 2 

(e)    Indemnifiable Costs  : Any and all Expenses, liability or loss, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and any interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes imposed as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement.  
 (f)   Indemnifiable Event  :  Any event or occurrence that takes place either prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company, or while a director is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or related to anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity, whether or not the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director of the Company, or in any other capacity, as described above.  
 (g)   Independent Counsel  :  Means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) the Indemnitee or (iii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification or Expense Advances hereunder, in any matter (other than with respect to matters relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses).  No law firm or lawyer shall qualify to serve as Independent Counsel if that person would, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement.  The Company shall select a law firm or lawyer to serve as Independent Counsel, subject to the consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
 (h)   Proceeding  :  Any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, internal, administrative or investigative that relates to an Indemnifiable Event.  
 (i)   Reviewing Party  :  Reviewing Party shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 3.  
 2.   Agreement to Indemnify  .  
 (a)   General Agreement regarding Indemnification  .  In the event Indemnitee was, is, or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee from and against Indemnifiable Costs, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto); provided that the Company s commitment set forth in this Section 2(a) to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be subject to the limitations and procedural requirements set forth in this Agreement.    
   (b)   Partial Indemnification  .  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Indemnifiable Costs,   
 3 

but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.  
 (c)   Advancement of Expenses  .  If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee (an  Expense Advance  or an  Advance ) within 21 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a request from Indemnitee for an Advance, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding; provided that the Company shall not advance any expenses to Indemnitee unless and until it shall have received a request and  undertaking substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A  .  Any request for an Expense Advance shall be accompanied by an itemization, in reasonable detail, of the Expenses for which advancement is sought; provided however that Indemnitee need not submit to the Company any information that counsel for Indemnitee deems is privileged and exempt from compulsory disclosure in any proceeding.  Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses.  If Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in Section 4, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed). Indemnitee s obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.    
 (d)   Exception to Obligation to Indemnify and Advance Expenses  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless (i) the Company has joined in or the Board has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding; or (ii) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 5.  
 3.   Reviewing Party  .  
 (a)   Definition of Reviewing Party  . Other than as contemplated by Section 3(b), the person, persons or entity  who shall determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in the first instance ( the Reviewing Party ) shall be (i) the Board of Directors of the Company acting by a majority vote of a quorum of Disinterested Directors or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written determination to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.  
   (b)   Reviewing Party Following Change in Control  . After a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors), the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Counsel.  With respect to all matters arising from such a Change in Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or   
 4 

hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from the Independent Counsel.    Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys  fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of Independent Counsel pursuant hereto.  
 4.   Indemnification Process and Appeal.  
 (a)   Indemnification Payment  .     
 (i)   The determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall, to the extent practicable, be made by the Reviewing Party not later than 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written demand on the Company for indemnification (which written demand shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification).  The Reviewing Party making the determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall notify Indemnitee of such written determination no later than two business days thereafter.    
 (ii)   Unless the Reviewing Party has provided a written determination to the Company that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs, and shall receive payment thereof, from the Company in accordance with this Agreement within 10 business days after the Reviewing Party has made its determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification.   
 (b)   Suit to Enforce Rights  .  If (i) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made within the time limitation for such a determination set forth in Section 4(a)(i), (ii) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) is not made within the period permitted for such payment by such section, (iii) the Reviewing Party determines pursuant to Section 4(a) that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) Indemnitee has not received advancement of Expenses within the time period permitted for such advancement by Section 2(c), then Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the indemnification and advancement rights granted under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof.  The Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding.  Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by the Indemnitee within six months of the date of the Reviewing Party s determination shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.  The remedy provided for in this Section 4 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee in law or equity.  
 (c)   Defense to Indemnification, Burden of Proof, and Presumptions  .  
 5 

(i)    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification (or payment of Expense Advances) hereunder, the Reviewing Party shall presume that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (or payment of Expense Advances) under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Reviewing Party of any determination contrary to that presumption.  
 (ii)   It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.  
 (iii)   For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval and whether with or without an admission of liability on the part of the Indemnitee), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  
 (iv)     For purposes of any determination under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Company. The provisions of this Section 4(c)(iv) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.  
 (v)   The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  
 5.   Indemnification for Expenses Incurred in Enforcing Rights  .    The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law and, if requested by Indemnitee pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2(c), shall advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by Indemnitee for:  
 (i)   enforcement of this Agreement;  
   (ii)   indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs or Expense Advances by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the   
 6 

Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events; and/or  
 (iii)   recovery under directors  and officers  liability insurance policies maintained by the Company.  
 6.   Notification and Defense of Proceeding.  
 (a)   Notice  .  Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement thereof.  The failure to notify or promptly notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement, and shall not relieve the Company from liability hereunder except to the extent the Company has been prejudiced or as further provided in Section 6(c).  
 (b)   Defense  .  With respect to any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense and except as otherwise provided below, to the extent the Company so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Company.  After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any Proceeding, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such Proceeding, but all Expenses related thereto incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense shall be at Indemnitee s expense unless: (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of the Proceeding, (iii) after a Change in Control, the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been approved by the Independent Counsel, or (iv) the Company shall not within 60 calendar days in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which case all Expenses of the Proceeding shall be borne by the Company.  If the Company has selected counsel to represent Indemnitee and other current and former directors, officers or employees of the Company in the defense of a Proceeding, and a majority of such persons, including Indemnitee, reasonably object to such counsel selected by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this   Section 6(b)  , then such persons, including Indemnitee, shall be permitted to employ one additional counsel of their choice and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , that such counsel shall be chosen from amongst the list of counsel, if any, approved by any company with which the Company obtains or maintains insurance.  In the event separate counsel is retained by a group of persons including Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 6(b), the Company shall cooperate with such counsel with respect to the defense of the Proceeding, including making documents, witnesses and other reasonable information related to the defense available to such separate counsel pursuant to joint-defense agreements or confidentiality agreements, as appropriate.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Indemnitee shall have made the determination provided for in (ii) above.  
 7 

(c)    Settlement of Claims  .    The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Company s written consent.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee s written consent.  Neither the Company nor the Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.  The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement with regard to any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action; the Company s liability hereunder shall not be excused if participation in the Proceeding by the Company was barred by this Agreement.  
 7.   Non-Exclusivity  .    The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the laws of the State of Delaware, the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  
 8.   Liability Insurance  .    To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors  or officers  liability insurance, Indemnitee, if a director of the Company, shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms.  
 9.   Amendment of this Agreement  .    No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  Except as specifically provided herein, no failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver thereof.  
 10.   Subrogation  .    In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  
 11.   No Duplication of Payments  .    The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (whether under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s Amended and Restated By-laws, any insurance policy, by law, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.  
   12.   Binding Effect  .    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and   
 8 

legal representatives.  The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company s request.  
 13.   Severability  .    If any provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, void, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, void, or unenforceable.  
 14.   Governing Law  .    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.  
 15.   Entire Agreement.    Subject to Section 7 hereof, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written, and implied, including the Prior Agreement, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.
