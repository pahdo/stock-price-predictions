1. 
    The Company and Basis of Presentation 
     AZZ Inc. ( AZZ , the  Company , "our" or  we ) was established in 1956 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. We are a global provider of galvanizing services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the power generation, transmission, distribution, refining and industrial markets.  We have two distinct operating segments: the Energy Segment and Galvanizing Segment.  AZZ Galvanizing is a leading provider of metal finishing solutions for corrosion protection, including hot dip galvanizing to the North American steel fabrication industry.  AZZ Energy is dedicated to delivering safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers, and automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation to critical infrastructure in the energy markets worldwide. 
    
  Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   February 29, 2016  , which was derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended   February 29, 2016  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K covering such period.  
  Our fiscal year ends on the last day of February and is identified as the fiscal year for the calendar year in which it ends. For example, the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 is referred to as fiscal 2017. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of   August 31, 2016  , the results of its operations for the three and six months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows for the six months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  .  These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 
    
  Accounting Standards Recently Adopted 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The amendment in this ASU affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to employees and is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for these awards, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and allowing an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.  As permitted by ASU 2016-09, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the quarter ended August 31, 2016 with an effective date of March 1, 2016.  As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $1.3 million was recorded in the current quarter.  The tax benefit was driven primarily by the exercise, during the first six months of fiscal 2017, of share-based awards issued prior to FY2014.  The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Currently, debt issuance costs are recognized as deferred charges and recorded as other assets. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements."  ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted and is to be implemented retrospectively.  
  Effective March 1, 2016, we adopted these standards which required the retroactive application and represented a change in accounting principle.  The unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $1.4 million associated with a portion of

     Table of Contents  

our outstanding debt , which were previously presented as a component of intangibles and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, are reflected as a reduction to the carrying liability of our outstanding debt.  Debt issuance costs associated with our revolving line of credit remain classified in intangibles and other assets and continue to be charged to interest expense over the term of the agreement.  As a result of this change in accounting principal, the consolidated balance sheet  as of February 29, 2016 was adjusted as follows: 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." The standard requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing a right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", issued as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 ("ASU 2014-09"). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the guidance is that a Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 can be adopted by the Company either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  On April 1, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  As a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements or decided upon the method of adoption.

    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock awards.  
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

3. 
    Share-based Compensation 
     The Company has   one   share-based compensation plan, the 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). The purpose of the Plan is to promote the growth and prosperity of the Company by permitting the Company to grant to its employees, directors and advisors various types of restricted stock unit awards, performance share units, stock options, and stock appreciation rights to purchase common stock of the Company. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is   1,500,000   shares. As of   August 31, 2016   the Company has approximately   1,283,882   shares available for future issuance under the Plan.  
    
  Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
  Restricted stock unit awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date. Awards issued prior to fiscal 2015 generally have a   three   year cliff vesting schedule and award issued subsequent to fiscal 2015 generally vest ratably over a period of three years but these awards may vest early in accordance with the Plan s accelerated vesting provisions. 
  The activity of our non-vested restricted stock unit awards for the   six month period ended     August 31, 2016   is as follows: 

Performance Share Unit Awards 
  Performance share unit awards are valued at the market price of our common stock on the grant date.  These awards have a three year performance cycle and will vest and become payable, if at all, on the third anniversary of the award date.  The awards are subject to the Company s degree of achievement of a target annual average adjusted return on assets during these three year periods.  In addition, a multiplier may be applied to the total awards granted which is based on the Company s total shareholder return during such   three   year period in comparison to a defined specific industry peer group as set forth in the plan.      The activity of our non-vested performance share unit awards for the   six month period ended     August 31, 2016   is as follows: 
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

Stock Appreciation Rights 
  Stock appreciation rights are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These awards generally have a contractual term of   7   years and vest ratably over a period of   three   years although some may vest immediately on issuance. These awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
  A summary of the Company s stock appreciation rights activity for the   six month period ended     August 31, 2016   is as follows: 

The average remaining contractual term for those stock appreciation rights outstanding at   August 31, 2016   is   3.76   years, with an aggregate intrinsic value of   $4.8 million  . The average remaining contractual terms for those stock appreciation rights that are exercisable as of   August 31, 2016   is   3.53   years, with an aggregate intrinsic value of   $3.7 million  . 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan, which allows employees of the Company to purchase common stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. Offerings under this plan have a duration of   24 months   (the "offering period"). On the first day of an offering period (the  enrollment date ) the participant is granted the option to purchase shares on each exercise date at the lower of   85%   of the market value of a share of our common stock on the enrollment date or the exercise date. The participant s right to purchase common stock under the plan is restricted to no more than   $25,000   per calendar year and the participant may not purchase more than   5,000   shares during any offering period. Participants may terminate their interest in a given offering or a given exercise period by withdrawing all of their accumulated payroll deductions at any time prior to the end of the offering period. The fair value of the estimated number of shares to be issued under each offering is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  For the   six month period ended     August 31, 2016  , the Company issued   30,137   shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  
  Share-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits related to all the plans listed above were as follows: 

Unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units, performance share unit awards, stock appreciation rights,  and the employee stock purchase plan at   August 31, 2016   totals   $7.0 million  . 
  The Company s policy is to issue shares required under these plans from the Company s treasury shares or from the Company s authorized but unissued shares. As of   August 31, 2016  , no shares have been repurchased under the Company's share repurchase program (see Part II, Item 2) to satisfy these requirements.  The Company will periodically consider whether to utilize this program to repurchase shares in the future.

    Warranty Reserves 
     A reserve has been established to provide for the estimated future cost of warranties on a portion of the Company s delivered products and is classified within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Management periodically reviews the reserves and makes adjustments accordingly. Warranties cover such factors as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and workmanship. The following table shows changes in the warranty reserves since the end of fiscal 2016:

    Realignment Costs 
       
  As part of its ongoing efforts to optimize cost and effectiveness, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company undertook a review of its operations in order to optimize financial performance of its operating assets.  As a result, the Company recognized $8.0 million of realignment charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  A total of   $6.7 million   was  included in Cost of Sales for the disposition and write off of certain fixed assets within the Galvanizing Segment, including the cost of closing two plants, the write off of certain assets related to the conversion of a third plant from a standard galvanizing plant to a galvanized rebar plant, and the cost of writing off certain other functionally obsolete assets across other galvanizing plants.  We also reserved   $1.3 million   in Selling, General and Administrative Expense for realignment costs related to one-time employee severance associated with changes needed to improve management efficiency in the Energy and Galvanizing Segments. 
  The following table shows changes in the realignment accrual for the six months ended August 31, 2016: 

8. 
    Acquisitions 
       
  On March 1, 2016, we completed an acquisition of the equity securities of Power Electronics, Inc. ("PEI"), a Millington, Maryland-based manufacturer and integrator of electrical enclosure systems.  The acquisition of PEI will enhance our capacity to serve existing and new customers in a diverse set of industries along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. 
    
  Unaudited pro forma results of operations assuming the PEI acquisition had taken place at the beginning of each period are not provided because the historical operating results of PEI were not significant and pro forma results would not be significantly different from reported results for the periods presented.

    Subsequent Events 
       
  On October 3, 2016, AZZ entered into an agreement to divest its indirectly held subsidiary, Nuclear Logistics LLC ( NL ) to Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC ( Westinghouse ) in exchange for cash. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, and are subject to customary terms and conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the fall of 2016.  Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, due to the timing until closing and various other factors included in the contract, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable.

AZZ has provided additional information regarding risks associated with the business in AZZ s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 29, 2016   and other filings with the SEC, available for viewing on AZZ s website at www.azz.com and on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 
  You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements herein and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. These statements are based on information as of the date hereof and AZZ assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 29, 2016  , and with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  We have two distinct operating segments, the Energy Segment and the Galvanizing Segment, as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 29, 2016  . Management believes that the most meaningful analysis of our results of operations is to analyze our performance by segment. We use revenue and operating income by segment to evaluate our segments. Segment operating income consists of net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses that are specifically identifiable to a segment. For a reconciliation of segment operating income to pretax income, see Note 4 to our quarterly consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
  Orders and Backlog 
  Our entire backlog relates to our Energy Segment and was   $352.8 million   as of   August 31, 2016  , an increase of   $18.4 million  , or   5.5%  , as compared to   $334.5 million   as of   February 29, 2016  .  Our backlog increased   $14.7 million  , or   4.3%  , as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.  Both of these increases were primarily the result of the acquisition of PEI on March 1, 2016.  For the three months ended August 31, 2016, our book-to-ship ratio decreased from   1.09   to 1 to   0.99   to 1 when compared to same period of Fiscal 2016 due to the decrease in incoming orders of   $39.8 million  , or   17.1%  .  The table below includes the progression of the backlog:

Segment Revenues 
  For the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016  , consolidated revenues decreased   $19.2 million  , or   9.0%  , and   $5.4 million  , or   1.2%  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016. 
  The following table reflects the breakdown of revenue by segment: 

Revenues for the Energy Segment decreased   11.9%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , to   $97.6 million   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  The decrease in revenue during the second quarter was caused by several factors including reduced turnarounds in the U.S. refinery market, continued softness in the petrochemical market, and delays in the release of several large projects in the U.S. and overseas.  Revenues decreased   4.9%   for the six months ended   August 31, 2016   to   $235.7 million   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily on softness in the second quarter described above. 
  Revenues for the Galvanizing Segment decreased   5.8%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , to   $97.4 million   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  The decline was a result of a volume decrease in steel processed caused by softness in the solar, petrochemical, and the oil and gas markets which offset higher pricing during the period.  Revenues increased   3.4%  , for the six months ended   August 31, 2016  , to   $202.0 million   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of US Galvanizing, LLC and Alpha Galvanizing Inc. which occurred on June 5, 2015 and February 1, 2016, respectively.  
  Segment Operating Income 
  Operating income for the Energy Segment decreased by   $0.8 million  , or   9.0%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  This decrease is attributable to the same factors discussed previously in the Energy Segment revenue analysis in addition to the $0.7 million of realignment costs recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  Operating income for the six months ended   August 31, 2016   was relatively flat in comparison to the same period in fiscal 2016, and was affected by the results in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.    
  Operating income for the Galvanizing Segment decreased by   $10.3 million  , or   40.7%  , for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  This decrease was driven not only by lower revenues, but also by the recording  of a $7.3 million realignment charge related to the shutdown of two galvanizing plants, the repurposing of a third plant, and the disposal of obsolete assets.  Operating income decreased   $8.1 million  , or   17.1%  , for the six months ended   August 31, 2016   as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the realignment charges taken in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Corporate Expenses 
  Corporate expenses increased by   $0.4 million  , or   5.3%  , and   $1.8 million  , or   12.0%   for the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016   as compared to the same respective periods in fiscal 2016.  This increase is attributable to higher employee costs in fiscal 2017. 
    
  Interest 
  Interest expense for the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016   was   $3.6 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively.    The decrease in interest expense for the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016   in comparison to the same respective periods in the prior year was the result of a lower average outstanding debt balance.  As of   August 31, 2016  , our gross outstanding debt was   $302.5 million  , compared to   $360.2 million   outstanding as of   August 31, 2015  . Our gross debt to equity ratio was   0.59   to 1 as of   August 31, 2016  , compared to   0.80   to 1 as of   August 31, 2015  .   
  Net Gain On Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment and Insurance Proceeds 
  For the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and 2015, the Company recorded an insignificant net loss and net gain, respectively,  due to sales from miscellaneous equipment.  For the six months ended   August 31, 2016  , the Company recorded an insignificant net loss due to sales from miscellaneous equipment and for the six months ended   August 31, 2015  , the Company recorded a net gain of $0.4 million as a result of insurance proceeds received along with a gain on the sale of our St. Catharines property located in Ontario, Canada. 
  Other (Income) Expense 
  For the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016   and 2015, the amounts recorded to other (income) expense were insignificant and primarily attributable to foreign exchange (gains) and losses. 
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 10.4% and 26.0% for the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016  , respectively, as compared to 21.2% and 27.2% for the same respective periods in fiscal 2015.  The decrease in the rate for the three and six month periods ended   August 31, 2016   is primarily attributable to certain state tax benefits from realignment costs incurred and the adoption of ASU 2016-09. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities along with bank and bond market debt. Our cash requirements are generally for operating activities, cash dividend payments, capital improvements, debt repayment and acquisitions. We believe that our cash position, cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.  
  For the   six month period ended     August 31, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $50.0 million  , net cash used in investing activities was   $42.1 million  , and net cash used in financing activities was   $32.3 million  , resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of   $24.3 million  .  In comparison to fiscal 2016, the results in the statement of cash flows for the six month period ended   August 31, 2016  , are attributable to a decrease in net income, higher charges due to additional realignment  recorded during the year, and by a less favorable impact of  changes in working capital.  The Company use of cash was lower for capital improvements year over year and fewer acquisitions were completed during the first six months of fiscal 2016.  Repayments under our Credit Agreement were also higher during the first six months of fiscal 2017 when compared to the prior year. 
    
  Our working capital was   $159.2 million   as of   August 31, 2016  , as compared to $157.8 million at   August 31, 2015  .  
  On March 27, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America and other lenders.  The Credit Agreement provides for a $75.0 million term facility and a $225.0 million revolving credit facility that includes a $75.0 million  accordion  feature. The Credit Agreement is used to provide for working capital needs, capital improvements, dividends, future acquisitions and letter of credit needs. 
  Interest rates for borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on either a Eurodollar Rate or a Base Rate plus a margin  ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Eurodollar Rate is defined as LIBOR for a term equivalent to the borrowing term (or other similar interbank rates if LIBOR is unavailable).  The Base Rate is defined as the highest of the applicable Fed Funds rate plus 0.50%, the Prime rate, or the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0% at the time

of borrowing.  The Credit Agreement also carries a Commitment Fee for the unfunded portion ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% per annum, depending on our Leverage Ratio.     
  The $75.0 million term facility under the Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal and interest payments, which commenced on June 30, 2013 and are required to be made through March 27, 2018, the maturity date. 
  The Credit Agreement provides various financial covenants requiring us, among other things, to a) maintain on a consolidated basis net worth equal to at least the sum of $230.0 million, plus 50.0% of future net income, b) maintain on a consolidated basis a Leverage Ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.0, c) maintain on a consolidated basis a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least 1.75:1.0 and d) not to make Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on a consolidated basis in an amount in excess of $60.0 million during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014 and $50.0 million during any subsequent year. 
  On August 8, 2016 we executed the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement.  The changes included, among other things, amendments to covenants including removing the cap on Capital Expenditures, raising the limits on asset disposition and other secured debt, and establishing a basket for investments specifically in joint ventures.  The amendment also removed limitations on dividends and on redemption of equity interest as long as the Company s Leverage Ratio remained below 2.75:1.0. 
  As of   August 31, 2016  , we had $95.0 million of outstanding debt against the revolving credit facility provided and letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $21.4 million, which left approximately $108.6 million of additional credit available under the  Credit Agreement.   
  On March 31, 2008, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.24% unsecured Senior Notes (the  2008 Notes ) due March 31, 2018 through a private placement (the  2008 Note Offering ). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company s payment obligations with respect to the 2008 Notes may be accelerated upon any Event of Default, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement.  
  The Company entered into an additional Note Purchase Agreement on January 21, 2011 (the  2011 Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.42% unsecured Senior Notes (the  2011 Notes ), due in January of 2021, through a private placement (the  2011 Note Offering ). Pursuant to the 2011 Agreement, the Company's payment obligations with respect to the 2011 Notes may be accelerated under certain circumstances. 
  The 2008 Notes and the 2011 Notes each provide for various financial covenants requiring us, among other things, to a) maintain on a consolidated basis net worth (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) equal to at least the sum of $116.9 million plus 50.0% of future net income; b) maintain a ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA (as defined in Note Purchase Agreement) not to exceed 3.25:1.00; c) maintain on a consolidated basis a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of at least 2.0:1.0; d) not at any time permit the aggregate amount of all Priority Indebtedness (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to exceed 10.0% of Consolidated Net Worth. 
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 
  Historically, we have not experienced a significant impact on our operations from increases in general inflation other than for specific commodities. We have exposure to commodity price increases in both segments of our business, primarily copper, aluminum, steel and nickel based alloys in the Energy Segment and zinc and natural gas in the Galvanizing Segment. We attempt to minimize these increases through escalation clauses in customer contracts for copper, aluminum, steel and nickel based alloys, when market conditions allow and through fixed cost contract purchases on zinc. In addition to these measures, we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing process, supply chain management, and through increases in prices where competitively feasible. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED MATTERS 
  Other than operating leases discussed below, there are no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources of the Company.

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS 
  Leases 
  We lease various facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.   
  Commodity pricing 
  The Company manages its exposure to commodity prices through the use of the following: 
  In the Energy Segment, we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper, aluminum, steel, and nickel based alloys. Because the Energy Segment does not commit contractually to minimum volumes, increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in customer contracts, although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be obtainable. In addition, we attempt to enter into firm pricing contracts with our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers to minimize risk. 
  In the Galvanizing Segment, we utilize contracts with our zinc suppliers that include protective caps and fixed cost contracts to guard against rising zinc prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. Management believes these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings. 
  We have no contracted commitments for any commodities including steel, aluminum, natural gas, nickel based alloys, copper, zinc or any other commodity, except for those entered into under the normal course of business. 
    
  Other 
  At   August 31, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $21.4 million. These letters of credit are issued, in lieu of performance and bid bonds, to some of our customers to cover any potential warranty costs that the customer might incur.  
  The following summarizes our operating leases, debt principal payments, and interest payments for the next five years and beyond. 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Market risk affecting our operations results primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices. We have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. 
  In the Energy Segment, we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper, aluminum, steel and nickel based alloys. Increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses in our customers' contracts, although during difficult market conditions customers' may resist these escalation clauses. In addition, we attempt to enter into firm pricing contracts with our vendors on material at the time we receive orders from our customers to minimize risk. We manage our exposures to commodity prices, primarily zinc used in our Galvanizing Services Segment, by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps and fixed contracts to guard against escalating commodity prices. We also secure firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible. We believe these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price escalation. 
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company had exposure to foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in Canada, China, Brazil, Poland, and the Netherlands.

We do not believe that a hypothetical change of 10% of the interest rate or currency exchange rate that are currently in effect or a change of 10% of commodity prices would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows as long as we are able to pass along the increases in commodity prices to our customers. However, there can be no assurance that either interest rates, exchange rates or commodity prices will not change in excess of the 10% hypothetical amount or that we would be able to pass along rising costs of commodity prices to our customers, and such hypothetical change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  The Company and its subsidiaries are named defendants in various routine lawsuits incidental to our business.  These proceedings include labor and employment claims, use of the Company s intellectual property, worker s compensation and various environmental  matters, all arising in the normal course of business.  Although the outcome of these lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and the amount of any potential liability that could arise with respect to such lawsuits or other matters cannot be predicted at this time, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not expect liabilities, if any, from these claims or proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 29, 2016  . 
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  In January of 2012, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to ten percent of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock.
