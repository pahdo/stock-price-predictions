  1.    The Company and Significant Accounting
Policies  

Organizational Background:  E-Qure Corp. f/k/a ADB
International Group, Inc., ("EQURE" or the "Company") is a Delaware
corporation with offices in Israel. E-QURE CORP. ("EQURE") owns IP of innovate technology of wound healing device (BST). 
	  Basis of Presentation:   
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
	which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The
	Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating
	costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since inception.  
	  Significant Accounting Policies  

Use of Estimates: 
	  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from the estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: 
	  For financial statement presentation purposes,
the Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Property and Equipment : 
	 New property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Property and equipment included in the bankruptcy proceedings and transferred to the
Trustee had been valued at liquidation value. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 5 years.
Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Expenditures for minor items,
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Gain or loss upon sale or
retirement due to obsolescence is reflected in the operating results in the period the
event takes place. 

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  
	 We review the recoverability of our
long-lived assets including equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, when events
or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the
difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Our primary measure of fair
value is based on discounted cash flows. The measurement of impairment requires management
to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets, as well as other fair
value determinations. 

Stock Based Compensation : 
	 Stock-based awards are accounted for using the
fair value method in accordance with ASC 718,  Share-Based Payments . Our
primary type of share-based compensation consists of stock options. We use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model in valuing options. The inputs for the valuation
analysis of the options include the market value of the Company s common stock, the
estimated volatility of the Company s common stock, the exercise price of the
warrants and the risk free interest rate. 

Accounting For Obligations And Instruments Potentially To Be Settled In The
Company s Own Stock : 
	 We account for obligations and instruments potentially
to be settled in the Company s stock in accordance with FASB ASC 815,  Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments.  This issue addresses the initial balance
sheet classification and measurement of contracts that are indexed to, and potentially
settled in, the Company s own stock. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  
	 FASB ASC 825,  Financial
Instruments,  requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments,
both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which
it is practicable to estimate fair value. FASB ASC 825 defines fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
carrying value of certain financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts
payable and accrued expenses.) approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the
instruments or interest rates, which are comparable with current rates.  

  Fair Value Measurements:  
	 The Company measures fair value under a framework
that utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of
inputs which prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value are:  

 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the
measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to Level 1 inputs. 

 Level 2: Other inputs that are observable, directly or indirectly, such as quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities or market corroborated inputs. 

 Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available, which
requires the Company to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would
value the assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to
Level 3 inputs. 

 In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques in its assessment
that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are
carried at fair value, classified according to the three categories described above:

When the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring financial
assets and liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current market conditions
or other factors, it may need to transfer those assets or liabilities to another level in
the hierarchy based on the new inputs used. The Company recognizes these transfers at the
end of the reporting period that the transfers occur. For the periods ended
September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no significant transfers of financial assets or
financial liabilities between the hierarchy levels.  

Earnings per Common Share:   
	  We compute net income (loss) per
share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earning per Share . ASC 260 requires
presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock
price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive
potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

Income Taxes:   
	  We have adopted ASC 740,  Accounting
for Income Taxes.  Pursuant to ASC 740, we are required to compute tax asset
benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating
losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot
be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried
forward in future years.  

  We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax
expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the
calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the
timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.  

  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using
the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. ASC 740
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more
likely than not to occur. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our
generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to
realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss, or
NOL, carryforwards. We have determined it more likely than not that these timing
differences will not materialize and have provided a valuation allowance against
substantially all of our net deferred tax asset. Management will continue to evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax asset and its related valuation allowance. If our
assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to
change, we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we
make the determination. Our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of
income or loss in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  

  In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities
for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our
estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we
ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we will reverse the
liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the
liability is no longer necessary. We will record an additional charge in our provision for
taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we
expect the ultimate assessment to be.  

  ASC 740 which requires recognition of estimated income taxes payable or
refundable on income tax returns for the current year and for the estimated future tax
effect attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards. Measurement of deferred
income tax is based on enacted tax laws including tax rates, with the measurement of
deferred income tax assets being reduced by available tax benefits not expected to be
realized.  

   Uncertain Tax Positions:   

  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48,
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes  ( FIN No. 48 ) which was
effective for the Company on January 1, 2007.  FIN No. 48 addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under FIN No. 48, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such position should be measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement.  FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements.  

  Our federal and state income tax returns are open for fiscal years
ending on or after December 31, 2008. We are not under examination by any jurisdiction for
any tax year. At September 30, 2016, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and
no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required under FIN 48.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations
	(Topic 805) ( ASU 2015-16 ). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer
	retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business
	combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for
	adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update
	require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that
	are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
	which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also
	record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of
	changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a
	result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the
	accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity
	is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or
	disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount
	recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been
	recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional
	amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is
	effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU
	2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
	consolidated financial statements.  In August, 2015, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral
	of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ). The amendment in this ASU defers the
	effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public
	business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee
	benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting
	periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
	within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of
	annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including
	interim reporting periods with that reporting period.  In April 2015,
	the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
	Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest
	(Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which changes the presentation of debt
	issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to
	present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
	related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs
	will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
	permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior
	period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
	impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.  
	  In the opinion of management, the information furnished in these interim
financial statements reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of and for the three
	and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. The Financial Statements do not include some information and notes necessary to
conform to annual reporting requirements.  
	  
	  2. Stockholders' Equity  
	  Common Stock  
	 We are currently authorized to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of $0.00001
	par value common stock. All issued shares of common stock are entitled to
	vote per share basis. On May 12, 2014 the Board approved a 1 for 100 reverse
	split of the common stock. In conjunction with the reverse split the Company
	redomiclied from New Jersey to Delaware.  
	  Recent Issuances of Common Stock During the Period ended September 30,
	2016:    
	 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not issue any
	shares nor receive any stock receivable.  
	  Recent Issuances of Common Stock in 2015:    
	 During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we received $70,000 in
	stock receivable. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we received
	$100,000 in stock receivable. 
	  Stock Options  
	 On January 1, 2015, the board of director approved the 2015 Employee
	Incentive Plan. The total number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
	issuance by the Company either directly as Stock Awards or underlying
	Options granted under this Plan is 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock. On
	January 1, 2015, the Company granted options as follows under its 2015
	Employee Incentive Plan: (i) Professor Ohry was granted options to purchase
	250,000 shares of the Registrant's common stock ( Option Shares ) at an
	exercise price equal to one dollar ($1.00) per Option Share. The Option
	Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms of a Scientific Advisory Board
	Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Ohry SAB Agreement ). Provided the
	Ohry SAB Agreement remains in effect, 75,000 shares shall vest July 1, 2015,
	and the remaining 175,000 Option Shares shall vest at the rate of 25,000
	Option Shares per quarter on the first day of each consecutive quarter; (ii)
	Dr. Ben Zion Weiner was granted options to purchase 350,000 Option Shares at
	an exercise price equal to one dollar ($1.00) per Option Share. The Option
	Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms of a Scientific Advisory Board
	Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Weiner SAB Agreement ). Provided the
	Weiner SAB Agreement remains in effect, 105,000 Option Shares shall vest
	July 1, 2015 and the remaining 245,000 Option Shares shall vest at the rate
	of 35,000 Option Shares per quarter on the first day of each consecutive
	quarter; and (iii) Michel Sessler was granted options to purchase 150,000
	Option Shares at an exercise price equal to one dollar ($1.00) per Option
	Share. The Option Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms of a Scientific
	Advisory Board Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Sessler SAB
	Agreement ). Provided the Sessler SAB Agreement remains in effect, 45,000
	Option Shares shall vest July 1, 2015 and the remaining 105,000 Option
	Shares shall vest at the rate of 15,000 Option Shares per quarter on the
	first day of each consecutive quarter.  
	 Following is a table summarizing options still outstanding and
	exercisable along with exercise price and range of remaining term. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
	December 31, 2015, we expensed $345,107 and $458,463, respectively, in
	relation to options granted.  
	  Preferred Stock  
	  We are currently authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares
	of $0.00001 par
	value preferred stock.
	There are no preferred shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
	2015.  
	  3. Related Party Transactions Not Disclosed Elsewhere  
	 During the three and nine months ended September
	30, 2016, there were no related party transactions.  
	 On January 1, 2015, the board of director
	approved the 2015 Employee Incentive Plan. The total number of shares of
	Common Stock reserved for issuance by the Company either directly as Stock
	Awards or underlying Options granted under this Plan is 5,000,000 shares of
	Common Stock. On January 1, 2015, the Company granted options as follows
	under its 2015 Employee Incentive Plan: (i) Professor Ohry was granted
	options to purchase 250,000 shares of the Registrant's common stock ( Option
	Shares ) at an exercise price equal to one dollar ($1.00) per Option Share.
	The Option Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms of a Scientific Advisory
	Board Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Ohry SAB Agreement ). Provided
	the Ohry SAB Agreement remains in effect, 75,000 shares shall vest July 1,
	2015, and the remaining 175,000 Option Shares shall vest at the rate of
	25,000 Option Shares per quarter on the first day of each consecutive
	quarter; (ii) Dr. Ben Zion Weiner was granted options to purchase 350,000
	Option Shares at an exercise price equal to one dollar ($1.00) per Option
	Share. The Option Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms of a Scientific
	Advisory Board Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Weiner SAB Agreement ).
	Provided the Weiner SAB Agreement remains in effect, 105,000 Option Shares
	shall vest July 1, 2015 and the remaining 245,000 Option Shares shall vest
	at the rate of 35,000 Option Shares per quarter on the first day of each
	consecutive quarter; and (iii) Michel Sessler was granted options to
	purchase 150,000 Option Shares at an exercise price equal to one dollar
	($1.00) per Option Share. The Option Shares shall vest pursuant to the terms
	of a Scientific Advisory Board Agreement dated January 1, 2015 (the  Sessler
	SAB Agreement ). Provided the Sessler SAB Agreement remains in effect,
	45,000 Option Shares shall vest July 1, 2015 and the remaining 105,000
	Option Shares shall vest at the rate of 15,000 Option Shares per quarter on
	the first day of each consecutive quarter. See also footnote two above.  
	  4. Going Concern  
	 The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
	which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The
	Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating
	costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since inception. These and other factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
	assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
	the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

5. Subsequent Events  

The Company has approximately $400,000, representing subscription proceeds
from investors, which funds are being held by the Company's SEC attorney in
a trust account for the benefit of the Company. The funds have been restricted in a favor
of a third party related to personal debt in the amount of $200,000. The SEC
attorney has retained counsel to secure the release of the entire $400,000, and
is
waiting on the final Referee's ruling about releasing the funds in favor of the
Company. However, there is some uncertainty about the timing and amount of funds
that will be released to the Company. 
	 During October 2016, the Company signed a settlement agreement with ABIA
	for
	the amount of $300,000,after the Company commenced legal action against
	Austen Bioinnovation Institute of Akron ( ABIA ) in the Supreme Court of the
	State of New York, New York County (the  Lawsuit ).  
	 On October 14, 2016, the Registrant received notification from FDA that
	it has granted conditional approval to the IDE application, authorizing us
	to commence a clinical investigation of our BST Device for wound healing.
	The main condition set forth is that the trial will begin initially with 10
	patients, after which we will file a safety report with the FDA before
	proceeding with the trial, which contemplates testing the BST Device with 90
	patients altogether.

2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   Back to Table of Contents    

The following plan of operation provides information
	which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of
	our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be
	read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section
	includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current
	views with respect to future events and financial performance.
	Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe,
	expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or
	words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place
	undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
	statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
	actual results to differ materially from our predictions.  
	  Plan of Operations   
	 In January 2014, Mr. Weissberg negotiated with Lifewave
	Ltd., a public company organized under the laws of the State of Israel, for
	the purpose of acquiring certain of Lifewave's IP assets pertaining to a
	wound healing device. The Registrant signed a patent purchase agreement with
	Lifewave on January 6, 2014 (the  Agreement ), the closing of which was
	subject to several material conditions, including our ability of raising
	equity capital sufficient to develop and commercially exploit the
	technology.  
	 On June 4, 2014, we completed the purchase of all right,
	title and interest to certain IP assets, including rights to a wound
	treatment device. The IP assets, including the wound healing device,
	acquired by the Registrant are designed for wound treatment incorporating
	Bioelectrical Signal Therapy ( BST Device ). The BST Device implements
	patented and proprietary electrical stimulation technologies to treat
	hard-to-cure wounds and ulcers up to complete closure and/or cure.  
	 Pursuant to the Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to
	pay Lifewave a royalty of from 10% to 20% of the profits (as defined in the
	Agreement) generated from the BST Device.  
	  In June 2014, the Registrant entered into an agreement
	with the Austen BioInnovation Institute in Akron ( ABIA  or the
	 Institute ), for the purpose of bringing our BST Device to the U.S. market.  
	 The Company's management selected ABIA's Product
	Innovation and Commercialization Division, which has significant expertise
	in wound healing, clinical trial development, and regulatory operations, to
	spearhead its pre-market clinical trial program, which is necessary to apply
	for regulatory approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration
	( FDA ) to distribute the BST Device in the United States. As part of the
	Institute's fully integrated regulatory and device development service
	Offerings, ABIA will prepare on behalf of the Company an application to
	obtain FDA approval. The initial trial will include 70 patients in a
	double-arm, randomized, multi-center study to assess the safety and efficacy
	of the BST Device in patients with Stage II and III pressure and venous
	stasis ulcers; and submit data to the FDA to obtain approval.  
	 On December 18, 2015, the Registrant confirmed certain
	information that it had received from ABIA that, while ABIA still
	anticipated that it would be able to provide the Registrant with a final
	draft of the IDE application, ABIA had sustained financial difficulties and
	key personnel losses that would likely adversely effect its ability to
	perform under the Agreement on a timely basis, if at all. As a result, the
	Registrant requested that ABIA fully refund the monies paid to ABIA under
	the Agreement. In addition, the Registrant agreed to engage a professional
	regulatory consultant, who was a former member of ABIA's regulatory staff,
	to serve as the Registrant's FDA regulatory consultant on an interim basis,
	subject to the execution of a separate services agreement. The Registrant is
	also evaluating the advisability of engaging another firm to replace ABIA,
	which process may be expected to delay the IDE approval process for the BST
	Device.  
	 The Company's success is dependent upon the successful
	FDA clinical trial of its BST Device. The Device may need additional
	development and may never achieve safety or efficacy. The Company believes
	that its design and procedure show promise, but the path to commercial
	success, even if development milestones are met, may take more time and
	might be costlier. 
	 There are a number of potential obstacles the Company might face,
including the following:  
 
 &#159   We may not be able to raise additional funds
we may need to complete the clinical trials.  
 &#159  Competitors may develop alternatives that render
BST Device redundant or unnecessary.  
 &#159  We may not have a sufficient and sustainable
intellectual property position.  
 &#159  Our device may be shown to have harmful side
effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be safe and effective.  
 &#159  Our device may not receive regulatory approval.  
 &#159  Even if our device receives regulatory approval, it
may not be accepted by patients, the medical community or third-party payers.  

 During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the
Registrant raised $2.395 million in equity capital to fund its plans to obtain
FDA approval, developing marketing and sales capacities and actively engage in
the medical device industry, generally, and in wound treatment, specifically.  
	 Effective October 15, 2014, through our wholly-owned
	Israeli subsidiary, ESQURE, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with
	Michael Cohen. We purchased all of Mr. Cohan's assets (the  Seller's
	Assets ) related to our BST Device for 875,000 restricted shares of common
	stock valued at $350,000. The Seller's Assets settled a subscription
	receivable under a previous subscription agreement for the same number of
	shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we purchased
	all of Seller's Assets related to our BST Device.  
	 On December 28, 2014, the Registrant entered into a
	preliminary distribution agreement with Rubifarm S.A., an entity organized
	under the laws of Argentina ( Rubifarm ), which agreement is subject to
	approval by the regulatory authorities of Argentina. At the date of
	regulatory approval, which is anticipated during the 4th quarter of 2015, a
	definitive agreement will be executed and filed with the SEC. The agreement
	contemplates that Rubifarm will be granted exclusive distribution rights for
	the BST Device&#153 in Argentina for an initial term of 5 years subject to Rubifarm meeting a minimum purchase quota of $1.5 million during the initial
	5-year term in order to retain its exclusivity.  
	 On July 30, 2015, the Company reported that it entered
	into an exclusive distribution agreement (the  Distribution Agreement ) with
	Chemipal Ltd, a closely-held Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange listed company
	organized under the laws of the State of Israel ( Chemipal ). Chemipal has
	been actively engaged in the distribution of medical products in Israel
	since 1941. Under the Distribution Agreement, the Registrant has granted
	Chemipal exclusive distribution rights to the Registrant's medical device
	for the treatment of chronic wounds (the  BST Device&#153) and the accompanying
	disposable electrodes (sometimes collectively, the  Products ) in Israel for
	an initial 5 year term, subject to Chemipal satisfying a minimum purchase
	quota of $3 million during the term.  
	 On December 18, 2015, the Registrant confirmed certain
	information that it had received from ABIA that, while ABIA still
	anticipated that it would be able to provide the Registrant with a final
	draft of the IDE application, ABIA had sustained financial difficulties and
	key personnel losses that would likely adversely effect its ability to
	perform under the Agreement on a timely basis, if at all. As a result, the
	Registrant requested that ABIA fully refund the monies paid to ABIA under
	the Agreement. In addition, the Registrant agreed to engage a professional
	regulatory consultant, who was a former member of ABIA's regulatory staff,
	to serve as the Registrant's FDA regulatory consultant on an interim basis,
	subject to the execution of a separate services agreement. The Registrant is
	also evaluating the advisability of engaging another firm to replace ABIA,
	which process may be expected to delay the IDE approval process for the BST
	Device.  
	 In May 2016, the Company commenced legal action against Austen
	Bioinnovation Institute of Akron ( ABIA ) in the Supreme Court of the State
	of New York, New York County (the  Lawsuit ). The Lawsuit alleges the breach
	of contract against ABIA to a Clinical Trial Agreement between the Company
	and ABIA dated June 5, 2014 (the  CTA ) based upon, among other reasons: (i)
	the failure of ABIA to commit sufficient personnel to the Company's BST
	device project; (ii) misrepresenting the ability of its staff to perform its
	obligations under the CTA; (iii) failing to provide the FDA with adequate
	evidence to support the IDE applications and providing incorrect responses
	to the FDA; and (v) misappropriating the Company's funds for use on other
	ABIA projects and expenses rather than in fulfillment of its contract
	obligations. The Lawsuit seeks approximately $475,000 in actual damages,
	representing the fees paid by the Company to ABIA, loss of profits in an
	amount not less than $3 million and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and
	expenses. During October 2016, the Company signed settlement agreement with ABIA on the amount of $300,000. 
	 On July 18, 2016, the Company, through
	its wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Esqure Advanced Medical Devices Ltd
	(the  Subsidiary ), received: (i) the CE Certificate of Conformity and the
	ISO 13485 Certification. The CE Certification for the Registrant's BST Wound
	Healing Device is a declaration that it complies with the requirements of
	the EU related to health, safety and environmental protections and
	acknowledges that the BST Device may be legally marketed in the EU. As a
	result, the Registrant's Subsidiary is prepared to commence manufacturing
	and marketing its BST Device in Europe as well as other non-European
	countries that accept the CE Certification. The ISO is the International
	Organization for Standardization, and represents that the company's quality
	systems and procedures satisfies the requirements for a comprehensive
	quality management for the design and manufacture of medical devices.  
	  Results of Operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
	compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   
	 We have not
	generated any revenues during the three month ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015. We had operating expenses mainly related to general and administrative
	expenses and research and development expenses. During the three months ended
	September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $339,402 due
	to general and administrative expenses of $206,069 and research and
	development expenses of $133,333 as compared to a net loss from operation of
	$135,989 due to general and administrative expenses of $81,679 and research
	and development expenses of $54,310 in the same period in the prior year.  
	 Our R D expenses increased by $79,023 or 240% during the three months
	ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year mainly due to
	expenses related to FDA approval for our BST device. 
	 
	  Results of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
	compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   
	 We have not
	generated any revenues during the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015. We had operating expenses mainly related to general and administrative
	expenses and research and development expenses. During the nine months ended
	September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $834,546 due
	to general and administrative expenses of $655,456 and research and
	development expenses of $179,090 as compared to a net loss from operation of
	$541,109 due to general and administrative expenses of $379,336 and research
	and development expenses of $161,773 in the same period in the prior year.  
	 Our R D expenses increased by $17,317 or 11% during the
	nine months
	ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year mainly due to
	expenses related to FDA approval for our BST device. 
	 
	  Liquidity, Capital
	Resources and Strategy   
	 On September 30, 2016, we had total assets of
	$436,560 consisting of cash. On December 31, 2015, we had total assets of
	$880,639 consisting of cash. We had total current liabilities of $46,924 as
	of September 30, 2016 consisting of $1,564 in accounts payable and $45,360
	in accrued management fees. On December 31, 2015, we had total current
	liabilities of $1,564 consisting of
	accounts payable. We had no long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2016
	and December 31, 2015.  
	 We used $444,079 in our operating activities
	during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was due to a net loss
	of $834,546 offset by option expenses of $345,107 and an increase in
	accounts payable and accrued expenses of $45,360. We used $544,609 in our
	operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to
	a net loss of $541,109 and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
	expenses of $3,500.  
	 We financed our negative cash flow from operations
	during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 through cash on hand and
	during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 through the issuance of
	common stock of $170,000.  
	 We had no
	investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
	 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	with an auditor's going concern opinion for the years 2015 and 2014. This
	means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going
	business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to
	pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we
	have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated.  
	 The
	Company has reported a total accumulated deficit of $30,626,236 as of
	September 30, 2016 and $29,791,690 as of December 31, 2015.  
	 As of
	September 30, 2016, the Company had $436,560 cash on hand and had positive
	working capital of $389,636.  
	 We believe that our current cash on hand of
	$436,560, as of September 30, 2016, our ability to meet our operating
	requirements throughout the ensuing fiscal year, depends greatly on our
	ability to use the funds that are held buy our SEC attorney and are restricted in a
	favor of his personal debt. Although the Company has signed a settlement
	agreement with its formal supplier on the amount $300,000, those funds can
	bridge the gap until the restricted funds will be released. If we are unable to manage our working capital requirements
	with funding received from our most recent equity capital raise, we may
	require additional financing at satisfactory terms and conditions, of which
	there can be no assurance, in order to satisfy its ongoing capital
	requirements for the next twelve months in order to execute our plan of
	operation as presently constituted.  
	 We do not expect to generate cash
	flow from operations unless we receive FDA approval for our BST Device.  
	 Our management believes that our operations will generate revenues in the US
	beginning in 2017. We expect that FDA approval for our BST Device will
	improve our ability to generate revenues from sales in other geographic
	areas. Our future ability to generate cash flows from operations will depend
	on the demand for our BST Device, as well as general economic, financial,
	competitive and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  
	 If
	and when we receive FDA approval of our BST Device, of which there can be no
	assurance, our business might not generate sufficient future cash flow in an
	amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including
	working capital, capital expenditures, investments and other general
	corporate requirements.  
	  Availability of Additional Capital   
	 We have
	no commitments or arrangements, formal or otherwise, from any person or
	entity to provide us with any additional capital. The Company may be unable
	to implement its present plan of operation and this could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results
	of operations.  
	 Our future financing transactions may include the
	issuance of equity and/or debt securities. In the event that we seek to
	raise funds through additional private placements of equity or convertible
	debt, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely effected.
	Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may
	experience dilution or the new equity securities may have rights,
	preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common
	stock. We are not aware of any material trend, event or capital commitment,
	which would or could potentially adversely affect our liquidity. We do not
	have any arrangements with potential investors or lenders to provide us with
	any additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such
	additional financing will be available when required in order to proceed
	with the business plan.
