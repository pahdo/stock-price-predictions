1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Organization and Operations 
  NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS) is a publicly held Delaware limited partnership engaged in the transportation of petroleum products and anhydrous ammonia, the terminalling and storage of petroleum products and the marketing of petroleum products. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms  NuStar Energy,   NS,   the Partnership,   we,   our  and  us  are used in this report to refer to NuStar Energy L.P., to one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NuStar GP Holdings or NSH) (NYSE: NSH) owns our general partner, Riverwalk Logistics, L.P., and owns an approximate   15%   total interest in us as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, primarily NuStar Logistics, L.P. (NuStar Logistics) and NuStar Pipeline Operating Partnership L.P. (NuPOP). We have   three   business segments: pipeline, storage and fuels marketing.  
    
  Recent Developments 
  Employee Transfer from NuStar GP, LLC.   On March 1, 2016, NuStar GP, LLC, the general partner of our general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar GP Holdings, transferred and assigned to NuStar Services Company LLC (NuStar Services Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar Energy, all of NuStar GP, LLC s employees and related benefit plans, programs, contracts and policies (the Employee Transfer). As a result of the Employee Transfer, we pay employee costs directly and sponsor the long-term incentive plan and other employee benefit plans. Please refer to Note 7 for a discussion of this transfer and our related party agreements, Note 8 for a discussion of our employee benefit plans and Note 9 for a discussion of our long-term incentive plan. 
    
  Linden Acquisition.   On January 2, 2015, we acquired full ownership of ST Linden Terminal, LLC (Linden), which owns a refined products terminal in Linden, NJ with   4.3 million   barrels of storage capacity (the Linden Acquisition). Prior to the Linden Acquisition, Linden operated as a joint venture between us and Linden Holding Corp., with each party owning   50%  . On the acquisition date, we remeasured our existing   50%   equity investment in Linden to its fair value of   $128.0 million   and we recognized a gain of   $56.3 million   in  Other income (expense), net  in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and subsidiaries in which the Partnership has a controlling interest. Inter-partnership balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We account for investment in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. 
    
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, and all disclosures are adequate. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Financial information for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included in these Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Certain previously reported amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements and condensed notes have been reclassified to conform to 2016 presentation.

  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance that clarifies how entities should present certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows, including but not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and amendments should be applied retrospectively. We will adopt these provisions January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our statements of cash flows or disclosures. 
    
  Credit Losses 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires the use of a  current expected loss  model for financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses on such instruments based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This amended guidance also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand an entity s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and amendments should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance on our financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 
    
  Unit-Based Payments 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies certain aspects of accounting for unit-based payments to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after  December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. Prior to the Employee Transfer discussed in Note 1 above, we did not sponsor a unit-based compensation plan. Upon completion of the Employee Transfer, we adopted this amended guidance effective January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis, which did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. Please refer to Note 9 for a discussion of our long-term incentive plan. 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from most leases on the balance sheet. For lessors, this amended guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after      December 15, 2018, and amendments should be applied using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, with the option to use certain expedients. We are currently assessing the impact of this amended guidance on our financial position, results of operations and disclosures. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after                December 15, 2017, and amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt these provisions January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 
    
  Inventory 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. We will adopt these provisions January 1, 2017, and we do not expect the amended guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures.  
    
  Debt Issuance Costs 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance for the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the amended guidance, debt issuance costs will be presented on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that would allow debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements to continue to be presented as an asset on the balance sheet. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and retrospective application is required. On January 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted this  
  
    7 

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

guidance. As a result, we reclassified   $23.7 million   of deferred debt issuance costs from  Other long-term assets, net  to  Long-term debt  on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year. The standard is now effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective transition methods. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date. The FASB has subsequently issued several updates that amend and/or clarify the new revenue recognition standard. We are continuing to assess the impact of this new guidance on our financial position, results of operations and disclosures. However, based on our initial assessment, we do not believe the standard will significantly impact the amount or timing of revenues recognized under the vast majority of our revenue contracts.  

3. DEBT 
    
  Revolving Credit Agreement 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the balance under our   $1.5 billion     five  -year revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) increased by   $109.6 million  , which we used for general partnership purposes and to fund our capital expenditures. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on October 29, 2019 and bears interest, at our option, based on an alternative base rate, a LIBOR-based rate or a EURIBOR-based rate. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment if our debt rating is downgraded (or upgraded) by certain credit rating agencies. As of   September 30, 2016  , our weighted-average interest rate related to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement was   2.3%  , and we had   $992.2 million   outstanding. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   our consolidated debt coverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) could not exceed 5.00-to-1.00  . The requirement not to exceed a maximum consolidated debt coverage ratio may limit the amount we can borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement to an amount less than the total amount available for borrowing. As of   September 30, 2016  , letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement totaled   $15.8 million  , and we had   $491.9 million   available for borrowing. Our management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds 
  In 2008, 2010 and 2011, the Parish of St. James, Louisiana issued, pursuant to the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005, an aggregate   $365.4 million   of tax-exempt revenue bonds (the GoZone Bonds) associated with our St. James, Louisiana terminal expansions. The GoZone Bonds bear interest based on a weekly tax-exempt bond market interest rate, and interest is paid monthly. The weighted-average interest rate was   0.9%   as of   September 30, 2016  . Following the issuances, the proceeds were deposited with a trustee and are disbursed to us upon our request for reimbursement of expenditures related to our St. James terminal expansions. We include the amount remaining in trust in  Other long-term assets, net,  and we include the amount of bonds issued in  Long-term debt  on the consolidated balance sheets. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount received from the trustee totaled   $12.0 million   and   $13.6 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount remaining in trust totaled   $42.8 million  . 
    
  Receivables Financing Agreement 
  NuStar Energy and NuStar Finance LLC (NuStar Finance), a special purpose entity and wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar Energy, are parties to a   $125.0 million   receivables financing agreement with third-party lenders (the Receivables Financing Agreement) and agreements with certain of NuStar Energy s wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively with the Receivables Financing Agreement, the Securitization Program). NuStar Finance s sole business consists of purchasing receivables from certain of NuStar Energy s wholly owned subsidiaries and providing these receivables as collateral under the Securitization Program. NuStar Finance is a separate legal entity and the assets of NuStar Finance, including these accounts receivable, are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of NuStar Energy, its subsidiaries selling receivables under the Securitization Program or their affiliates.   The amount available for borrowing is based on the availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors and conditions.    
    
  Borrowings by NuStar Finance under the Receivables Financing Agreement bear interest at either the applicable commercial paper rate or the applicable bank rate, each as defined under the Receivables Financing Agreement.   The Securitization Program has an initial termination date of June 15, 2018, with the option to renew for additional 364-day periods thereafter.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $102.5 million   of our accounts receivable are included in the Securitization Program. The amount of  
  
    8 

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Financing Agreement totaled   $43.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is included in  Long-term debt  on the consolidated balance sheet. 

4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Contingencies  
  We have contingent liabilities resulting from various litigation, claims and commitments. We record accruals for loss contingencies when losses are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees associated with defending the Partnership in legal matters are expensed as incurred. We have accrued   $0.5 million   and   $4.8 million   for contingent losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The amount that will ultimately be paid may differ from the recorded accruals, and the timing of such payments is uncertain. In addition, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  We segregate the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists. We consider counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk in the determination of all estimated fair values. 
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The following assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

9 

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Product Imbalances.     Since we value our assets and liabilities related to product imbalances using quoted market prices in active markets as of the reporting date, we include these product imbalances in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives.     We base the fair value of certain of our commodity derivative instruments on quoted prices on an exchange; accordingly, we include these items in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. We also have derivative instruments for which we determine fair value using industry pricing services and other observable inputs, such as quoted prices on an exchange for similar derivative instruments, and we include these derivative instruments in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 for a discussion of our derivative instruments. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps.     Because     we estimate the fair value of our forward-starting interest rate swaps using discounted cash flows, which use observable inputs such as time to maturity and market interest rates, we include these interest rate swaps in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Guarantees.   In 2014, we sold our remaining   50%   ownership interest in NuStar Asphalt LLC, which then changed its name to Axeon Specialty Products LLC (Axeon). We provide credit support, such as guarantees, letters of credit and cash collateral, as applicable, of up to   $125.0 million   to Axeon. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have provided   $16.7 million   in letters of credit on behalf of Axeon. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we provided guarantees mainly for commodity purchases, lease obligations and certain utilities for Axeon with an aggregate maximum potential exposure of   $75.5 million   and   $71.9 million  , respectively, and   one   guarantee that does not specify a maximum amount as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , we provided   two   guarantees that did not specify a maximum amount. A majority of these guarantees have no expiration date. We estimated the fair value considering the probability of default by Axeon and an estimate of the amount we would be obligated to pay under the guarantees at the time of default based on the guarantees outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Our estimate of the fair value is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in our Level 3 liabilities:

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  We recognize cash equivalents, receivables, payables and debt in our consolidated balance sheets at their carrying amounts. The fair values of these financial instruments, except for a   $190.0 million   term loan to Axeon (the Axeon Term Loan) and long-term debt, approximate their carrying amounts.  
    
  The estimated fair values and carrying amounts of the long-term debt and the Axeon Term Loan were as follows: 

We estimated the fair value of our publicly traded senior notes based upon quoted prices in active markets; therefore, we determined that the fair value of our publicly traded senior notes falls in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For our other debt, for which a quoted market price is not available, we estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and determined that the fair value falls in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  We estimated the fair value of the Axeon Term Loan using discounted cash flows, which use observable inputs such as time to maturity and market interest rates, and determined that the fair value falls in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the Axeon Term Loan is   $170.4 million  , consisting of the following: (i) the outstanding principal amount from the Axeon Term Loan of   $190.0 million  ; (ii) plus the fair value of guarantees of   $1.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ; (iii) less equity losses from our investment in Axeon of   $21.3 million   incurred prior to the 2014 sale of our remaining ownership interest in Axeon and after the carrying value of our equity investment in Axeon was reduced to   zero  . The carrying value of the Axeon Term Loan is included in  Other long-term assets, net  on the consolidated balance sheets. We review the financial information of Axeon monthly for possible credit loss indicators. In 2015 and 2014, Axeon failed to make two scheduled principal payments, which, under the provisions of the Axeon Term Loan, increases the interest rate payable by Axeon until Axeon makes those outstanding payments.  

6. DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
    
  We utilize various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and commodity price risk. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor interest rates, futures and swap positions and over-the-counter positions, as well as physical commodity volumes, grades, locations and delivery schedules, to help ensure that our hedging activities address our market risks.  
  Interest Rate Risk  
  We are a party to certain interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, which include forward-starting interest rate swap agreements related to forecasted debt issuances in 2018 and 2020. We entered into these swaps in order to hedge the risk of changes in the interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate during the period from the effective date of the swap to the issuance of the forecasted debt. Under the terms of the swaps, we pay a fixed rate and   receive a rate based on three-month USD LIBOR  . These swaps qualified, and we designated them, as cash flow hedges. We record the effective portion of mark-to-market adjustments as a component of  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  (AOCI), and the amount in AOCI will be recognized in  Interest expense, net  as the forecasted interest payments occur or if the interest payments are probable not to occur. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate notional amount of forward-starting interest rate swaps totaled   $600.0 million  .  
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices. In order to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations with respect to our crude oil and finished product inventories and related firm commitments to purchase and/or sell such inventories, we utilize commodity futures and swap contracts, which qualify and we designate as fair value hedges. Derivatives that are intended to hedge our commodity price risk, but fail to qualify as fair value or cash flow hedges, are considered economic hedges, and we record associated gains and losses in net income. Our risk management committee oversees our trading controls and procedures and certain aspects of commodity and trading risk management. Our risk management committee also reviews all new commodity and trading risk management strategies in accordance with our risk management policy, as approved by our board of directors.

The volume of commodity contracts is based on open derivative positions and represents the combined volume of our long and short open positions on an absolute basis, which totaled   5.9 million     b  arrels and   8.0 million   barrels as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.5 million   of margin deposits; we had   no   margin deposits as of   December 31, 2015  . The fair values of our derivative instruments included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:  

Certain of our derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheets and subject to master netting arrangements. Under our master netting arrangements, there is a legally enforceable right to offset amounts, and we intend to settle such amounts on a net basis. The following are the net amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets: 

We recognize the impact of our commodity contracts on earnings in  Cost of product sales  on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and that impact was as follows:

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  GP Services Agreement.   Prior to the Employee Transfer, our operations were managed by NuStar GP, LLC under a services agreement effective January 1, 2008 pursuant to which employees of NuStar GP, LLC performed services for our U.S. operations. Employees of NuStar GP, LLC provided services to us and NuStar GP Holdings; therefore, we reimbursed NuStar GP, LLC for all employee costs incurred prior to the Employee Transfer, other than the expenses allocated to NuStar GP Holdings, as summarized below:  

In conjunction with the Employee Transfer, we entered into an Amended and Restated Services Agreement with NuStar GP, LLC, effective March 1, 2016 (the Amended GP Services Agreement).   The Amended GP Services Agreement provides that we will furnish administrative services necessary to conduct the business of NuStar GP Holdings. NuStar GP Holdings will compensate us for these services through an annual fee of $1.0 million, subject to adjustment based on the annual merit increase percentage applicable to our employees for the most recently completed fiscal year and for changes in level of service.  The Amended GP Services Agreement will terminate on March 1, 2020 and will automatically renew for successive two-year terms, unless terminated by either party.    
    
  Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   Also on March 1, 2016 and in connection with the Employee Transfer, we entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with NuStar GP, LLC (the Assignment Agreement). Under the Assignment Agreement, NuStar GP, LLC assigned all of its employee benefit plans, programs, contracts, policies, and various of its other agreements and contracts with certain employees, affiliates and third-party service providers (collectively, the Assigned Programs) to NuStar Services Co. In addition, NuStar Services Co agreed to assume the sponsorship of and all obligations relating to the ongoing maintenance and administration of each of the plans and agreements in the Assigned Programs.

The following table summarizes the related party transactions and changes to amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the Employee Transfer on March 1, 2016 (thousands of dollars): 

Balance Sheet Items.   We had a receivable from related party of   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , mainly comprised of service fees and expenses paid on behalf of NuStar GP Holdings. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a payable to related party of   $14.8 million  , mainly comprised of payroll, employee benefit plan expenses and unit-based compensation prior to the Employee Transfer, and   none   as of   September 30, 2016  . We also had a long-term payable to related party as of   December 31, 2015   of   $32.1 million  , representing long-term employee benefits prior to the Employee Transfer, and   none   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  Prior to the Employee Transfer, NuStar GP, LLC sponsored and maintained the defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans described below. Effective March 1, 2016, in connection with the Employee Transfer, we assumed sponsorship and responsibility for these defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, which include both qualified and nonqualified plans. The Employee Transfer did not have an impact on the benefits received by our employees.  
    
  Defined Benefit Plans 
  NuStar Pension Plan.     The NuStar Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) is a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that provides eligible U.S. employees with retirement income as calculated under a cash balance formula. Under the cash balance formula, benefits are based on age, service and interest credits, and employees become fully vested in their benefits upon attaining three years of vesting service.    
    
  NuStar Excess Pension Plan.   The NuStar Excess Pension Plan (the Excess Pension Plan) is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to a select group of management or other highly compensated employees. The Excess Pension Plan is not intended to constitute either a qualified plan under the provisions of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), or a funded plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).  
    
  The Pension Plan and Excess Pension Plan are collectively referred to as the Pension Plans. 
    
  Other Postretirement Benefits.   We also sponsor a contributory medical benefits plan for U.S. employees that retired prior to April 1, 2014. For employees that retire on or after April 1, 2014, we provide partial reimbursement for eligible third-party health care premiums. 
    
  We estimate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs from actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations require the use of certain assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and expected rates of compensation increase. The amortization of actuarial gains and losses reflects a corridor based on 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the pension plan assets.

The annual measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is December 31, and we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or a liability as of the balance sheet dates. We record changes in the funded status of our plans as a component of comprehensive income in the year the changes occur. The reconciliation of funded status for the Pension Plans and other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

On March 1, 2016, and in conjunction with the Employee Transfer, we assumed   $22.5 million   and   $10.2 million   in benefit obligations associated with the Pension Plans and other postretirement benefits, respectively. Prior to the Employee Transfer, we reimbursed all costs incurred by NuStar GP, LLC related to these employee benefit plans at cost. The following table summarizes the components of net periodic benefit costs for the Pension Plans and other postretirement benefits on a combined basis for periods prior to the Employee Transfer and after the Employee Transfer: 

In August 2016, we contributed   $15.6 million   to the Pension Plans. 
    
  Defined Contribution Plans    
  NuStar Thrift Plan.     The NuStar Thrift Plan (the Thrift Plan) is a qualified defined contribution plan and participation in the Thrift Plan is voluntary and open to substantially all our employees upon their date of hire. Thrift Plan participants can contribute from 1% up to 30% of their total annual compensation to the Thrift Plan in the form of pre-tax and/or after tax employee contributions. We make matching contributions in an amount equal to 100% of each participant s employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the participant s total annual compensation.    
    
  NuStar Excess Thrift Plan.   The NuStar Excess Thrift Plan (the Excess Thrift Plan) is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits to those employees whose compensation and/or annual contributions under the Thrift Plan are subject to the limitations applicable to qualified retirement plans under the Code. The Excess Thrift Plan is not intended to constitute either a qualified plan under the provisions of Section 401 of the Code or a funded plan subject to ERISA.

We also sponsor several other defined contribution plans for certain international employees located in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 

9. UNIT-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  Overview    
  On January 28, 2016, our unitholders approved the Fifth Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Amended 2000 LTIP) which, among other items, provides that we may use newly issued units from NuStar Energy to satisfy unit awards and extends the term of the Amended 2000 LTIP to January 28, 2026. Prior to the Employee Transfer, NuStar GP, LLC sponsored the Amended 2000 LTIP, and we reimbursed NuStar GP, LLC for awards under this plan. Upon the approval of the Amended 2000 LTIP, along with the Employee Transfer, most of our currently outstanding awards are now equity-classified awards.  
    
  Effective March 1, 2016, we assumed sponsorship of the Amended 2000 LTIP, which provides the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NuStar GP, LLC (the Compensation Committee) with the right to issue and award up to   3,250,000   of our common units to employees and non-employee directors. Awards available under the Amended 2000 LTIP include restricted units, performance units, unit options, unit awards and distribution equivalent rights (DER). The Compensation Committee may also include a tandem grant of a DER that will entitle the participant to receive cash equal to cash distributions made on any award prior to its vesting. As of March 1, 2016, common units that remained available to be awarded under the Amended 2000 LTIP totaled   1,200,261  .  
    
  On March 1, 2016, we assumed all outstanding awards under the Amended 2000 LTIP, which represented   688,647   units. The transfer of the outstanding awards qualifies as a plan modification. Therefore, we measured the fair value of the outstanding awards based on the unit price on the transfer date.  
    
  Our significant unit-based compensation awards are discussed below. 

Restricted Units 
  We account for restricted units expected to result in the issuance of our common units upon vesting as equity-classified awards. These restricted units are mainly granted to domestic employees and non-employee directors and represented   604,153   units on the Employee Transfer date. The outstanding restricted units granted to domestic employees generally vest over   five   years beginning one year after the grant date. The fair value of a restricted unit award for domestic employees is measured at the transfer date or grant date. Restricted units granted to non-employee directors generally vest over   three   years and the fair value of such award is measured at each reporting period. DERs paid with respect to outstanding, unvested restricted units reduce partners  equity, similar to cash distributions to unitholders. We record compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the fair value of the units at the grant date (for domestic employees) or the fair value of the units measured at each reporting period (for non-employee directors). 
    
  The outstanding restricted units granted to international employees are cash-settled and accounted for as liability-classified awards. These restricted units represented   49,121   units on the Employee Transfer date and vest over   three   to   five   years. We record compensation expense over the requisite service or vesting period based on the fair value of the award measured at each reporting period. The liability for restricted units granted to international employees is included in  Accrued liabilities  on our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Performance Units 
  Performance units are equity-classified awards issued to certain of our key employees and represent rights to receive our common units upon achieving an objective performance measure for the performance period.   The objective performance measure is determined each year by the NuStar GP, LLC Compensation Committee for the following year. Our achievement of the performance measure determines the rate at which the performance units convert into our common units, which can range from zero to 200%.    
    
  The performance units represented   35,373   units on the Employee Transfer date.   Performance units vest in three annual increments (tranches), based upon our achievement of the performance measure set by the Compensation Committee during the one-year performance periods that end on December 31 of each year following the date of grant.   Therefore, performance units are not considered granted until the Compensation Committee has set the performance measure for each tranche of awards. The fair value of our performance units is equal to the grant date fair value reduced by expected distributions over the vesting period as these awards do not receive DERs.  We record compensation expense ratably for each vesting tranche over its requisite

service period (one year) if it is probable that the specified performance measure will be achieved. Additionally, changes in the actual or estimated outcomes that affect the quantity of performance units expected to be converted are recognized as a cumulative adjustment.  
    
  We include compensation expense for the outstanding restricted units and performance units in  General and administrative expenses  on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

10. PARTNERS  EQUITY 
    
  Issuance of Common Units 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   595,050   common units representing limited partner interests at an average price of   $47.39   per unit for proceeds of   $28.3 million  , net of   $0.5 million   of issuance costs. We used these proceeds, which includes a contribution of   $0.6 million   from our general partner to maintain its   2%   general partner interest, for general partnership purposes, including repayments of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement. 
    
  Partners  Equity Activity

Allocations of Net Income 
  General Partner.   Our partnership agreement, as amended, sets forth the calculation to be used to determine the amount and priority of cash distributions that the limited partner unitholders and the general partner will receive. The partnership agreement also contains provisions for the allocation of net income and loss to the unitholders and the general partner. For purposes of maintaining partner capital accounts, the partnership agreement specifies that items of income and loss shall be allocated among the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests. Normal allocations according to percentage

interests are made after giving effect to priority income allocations, if any, in an amount equal to incentive cash distributions allocated   100%   to the general partner.  
    
  The following table details the calculation of net income applicable to the general partner: 

Cash Distributions 
  The following table reflects the allocation of total cash distributions to the general and limited partners applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned: 

The following table summarizes information related to our quarterly cash distributions: 

11. NET INCOME PER UNIT 
    
  Basic and diluted net income per unit is determined pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, all earnings are allocated to our limited partner unitholders and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive distributions earned during the period. Participating securities include our general partner interest, including incentive distribution rights, and restricted units awarded under our Amended 2000 LTIP.

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Basic net income per unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to our limited partner unitholders by the weighted-average number of limited partner units outstanding during the period. 
    
  Diluted net income per unit is computed by dividing net income attributable to our limited partner unitholders by the sum of (i) the weighted-average number of limited partner units outstanding during the period and (ii) the effect of dilutive potential limited partner units outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential limited partner units include contingently issuable performance units awarded under our Amended 2000 LTIP.

  Changes in current assets and current liabilities were as follows: 

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts reflected in the applicable consolidated balance sheets due to the change in the amount accrued for capital expenditures and the effect of foreign currency translation. In addition, see Note 7 for non-cash related party transactions associated with the Employee Transfer. 
    
  Cash flows related to interest and income taxes were as follows: 

13. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  Our reportable business segments consist of pipeline, storage and fuels marketing. Our segments represent strategic business units that offer different services and products. We evaluate the performance of each segment based on its respective operating income, before general and administrative expenses and certain non-segmental depreciation and amortization expense. General and administrative expenses are not allocated to the operating segments since those expenses relate primarily to the overall management at the entity level. Our principal operations include the transportation of petroleum products and anhydrous ammonia, the terminalling and storage of petroleum products and the marketing of petroleum products. Intersegment revenues result from storage agreements with wholly owned subsidiaries of NuStar Energy at rates consistent with the rates charged to third parties for storage.

  Recent Developments 
  Martin Terminal Acquisition.   On October 14, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Martin Operating Partnership L.P. to purchase crude oil and refined product storage assets in the Port of Corpus Christi for approximately   $93.0 million  , net (the Martin Terminal Acquisition). The assets to be acquired provide   900,000   barrels of crude oil storage capacity,   250,000   barrels of refined product storage capacity and exclusive use of the port s new crude oil dock. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.   
    
  Employee Transfer from NuStar GP, LLC.   On March 1, 2016, NuStar GP, LLC, the general partner of our general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar GP Holdings, transferred and assigned to NuStar Services Company LLC (NuStar Services Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar Energy, all of NuStar GP, LLC s employees and related benefit plans, programs, contracts and policies (the Employee Transfer). The Employee Transfer did not materially change our results of operations since we previously reimbursed NuStar GP, LLC for all employee costs attributable to us. However, as a result of the Employee Transfer, we pay employee costs directly and sponsor the long-term incentive plan and other employee benefit plans. Please refer to Note 7 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for further discussion on the Employee Transfer. 
    
  Linden Acquisition.   On January 2, 2015, we acquired full ownership of ST Linden Terminal, LLC (Linden), which owns a refined products terminal in Linden, NJ with 4.3 million barrels of storage capacity (the Linden Acquisition). Prior to the Linden Acquisition, Linden operated as a joint venture between us and Linden Holding Corp., with each party owning 50%. On

  Operations 
  We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, primarily NuStar Logistics, L.P. (NuStar Logistics) and NuStar Pipeline Operating Partnership L.P. (NuPOP). Our operations consist of three reportable business segments: pipeline, storage and fuels marketing. 
  Pipeline.   We own 3,140 miles of refined product pipelines and 1,230 miles of crude oil pipelines, as well as approximately 4.0 million barrels of storage capacity, which comprise our Central West System. In addition, we own 2,360 miles of refined product pipelines, consisting of the East and North Pipelines, and a 2,000 mile ammonia pipeline (the Ammonia Pipeline), which comprise our Central East System. The East and North Pipelines have storage capacity of approximately 6.7 million barrels. We charge tariffs on a per barrel basis for transporting refined products, crude oil and other feedstocks in our refined product and crude oil pipelines and on a per ton basis for transporting anhydrous ammonia in the Ammonia Pipeline. 
    
  Storage  . We own terminals and storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, including St. Eustatius in the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom (UK), with approximately 83.7 million barrels of storage capacity. Revenues for the storage segment include fees for tank storage agreements, whereby a customer agrees to pay for a certain amount of storage in a tank over a period of time (storage terminal revenues), and throughput agreements, whereby a customer pays a fee per barrel for volumes moving through our terminals (throughput terminal revenues). 
  Fuels Marketing  . Within our fuels marketing operations, we purchase crude oil and refined petroleum products for resale. The results of operations for the fuels marketing segment depend largely on the margin between our cost and the sales prices of the products we market. Therefore, the results of operations for this segment are more sensitive to changes in commodity prices compared to the operations of the pipeline and storage segments. We enter into derivative contracts to attempt to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations. 
    
  The following factors affect the results of our operations: 
             
    company-specific factors, such as facility integrity issues and maintenance requirements that impact the throughput rates of our assets; 
                
    seasonal factors that affect the demand for products transported by and/or stored in our assets and the demand for products we sell; 
                
    industry factors, such as changes in the prices of petroleum products that affect demand and operations of our competitors; 
                
    other factors, such as commodity price volatility that impact our fuels marketing segment; and 
                
    other factors that impact the operations served by our pipeline and storage assets, such as utilization rates and maintenance turnaround schedules of our refining company customers and drilling activity by our crude oil production customers. 
       
  Current Market Conditions 
  During 2015 and early 2016, the price of crude oil declined sharply, at times reaching lows not seen in over a decade. While the price has recovered modestly over the second half of the year, energy industry experts predict continued price volatility. 
    
  Increases or decreases in the price of crude oil affect various sectors of the energy industry, including our customers in crude oil production, refining and trading, in different ways. For example, the sustained period of low prices has forced some of our crude oil production customers to reduce their capital spending and drilling activity and narrow their focus to assets in the most cost-advantaged regions. However, while some of our refining company customers have benefitted from lower crude oil prices, particularly to the extent the lower feedstock price has been coupled with higher demand for certain refined products in some regional markets, recent increases in refined product inventory may cause some of our refining company customers to reduce their production levels. 
    
  Continued low crude oil prices seem to have been having a direct, negative impact on the unit price of many master limited partnerships, including our own, although recently that impact appears to be diminishing. Partly as a result of lower unit prices, earlier this year, we reduced our overall capital spending in order to minimize our need to access the public capital markets due to the prohibitively high costs of public debt and equity financing at the time; however, as financial markets have improved, costs have begun to drop. We will continue to evaluate our financing plans and access the markets as needed, if market conditions are favorable.

  Financial Highlights 
  (Unaudited, Thousands of Dollars, Except Unit and Per Unit Data) 

Overview 
  Net income decreased   $13.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to a reduction in operating income for our pipeline segment and an increase in general and administrative expenses.

Table of Contents  

Pipeline  
  Total revenues decreased   $8.9 million   and total throughputs decreased   87,703   barrels per day for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our Eagle Ford System contributed to a decrease in revenues of $10.0 million and a decrease in throughputs of 94,465 barrels per day due to reduced production resulting from a sustained low crude oil price environment. Revenues also decreased $5.3 million and throughputs decreased 15,210 barrels per day on our Ammonia Pipeline mostly due to a shipper s facility reconfiguration, resulting in fewer barrels available for transportation and maintenance downtime on a portion of the pipeline. 
    
  These decreases were partially offset by increases from our East Pipeline and our McKee System pipelines. Revenues increased $4.4 million and throughputs increased 20,290 barrels per day on our East Pipeline due to the completion of expansion projects in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as lower throughput in the third quarter of 2015 due to turnarounds at refineries served by the East Pipeline and maintenance downtime on a portion of the pipeline. Revenues increased $2.2 million and throughputs increased 8,243 barrels per day on our McKee System crude and refined products pipelines mainly due to increased production at the McKee refinery and increased volumes on pipelines with higher average tariffs.  
    
  Storage 
  Throughput terminal revenues decreased   $1.8 million   and throughputs decreased   62,407   barrels per day for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $2.8 million and a decrease in throughputs of 75,725 barrels per day at our Corpus Christi North Beach terminal. This is primarily due to reduced Eagle Ford Shale crude oil being shipped to Corpus Christi, consistent with the decrease in pipeline throughputs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues of $1.3 million and an increase in throughputs of 9,478 barrels per day at our McKee System terminals primarily due to increased production at the McKee refinery combined with increased demand in markets served by those terminals.  
    
  Storage terminal revenues decreased   $2.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenues at our UK terminals of $3.2 million mainly due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate.  In addition, revenues at our St. Eustatius terminal facility decreased $2.7 million mainly due to decreased throughput and related handling fees. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues of $2.2 million at our St. James, LA terminal mostly resulting from completed terminal expansion projects and increased product throughput and related handling fees.  Other domestic revenues also increased $1.5 million mainly due to rate escalations and new customer contracts at our Selby, CA and Piney Point, MD terminals.  
    
  Operating expenses decreased   $3.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease of $4.4 million in operating expenses at our St. Eustatius terminal facility, mainly associated with lower property taxes and employee related costs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million in maintenance and regulatory expenses, mainly at our central west terminals.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $1.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to the completion of storage projects. 
    
  Fuels Marketing  
  Segment operating loss declined   $1.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to decreased operating expenses, mainly resulting from lower railcar costs associated with our fuel oil operations.  
    
  Consolidation and Intersegment Eliminations  
  Revenue and operating expense eliminations primarily relate to storage fees charged to the fuels marketing segment by the storage segment. Cost of product sales eliminations represent expenses charged to the fuels marketing segment for costs associated with inventory that are expensed once the inventory is sold. 
    
  General 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $3.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower compensation expense associated with our long-term incentive plan in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Interest expense, net increased   $1.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to increased interest costs associated with higher borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Table of Contents  

Other income, net decreased   $1.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to gains associated with the sale of assets in 2015. 
    
  Income tax expense decreased   $2.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower margin tax in Texas, a decrease in the UK tax rate and a reduction in our St. Eustatius withholding tax. 
    
  Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Financial Highlights 
  (Unaudited, Thousands of Dollars, Except Unit and Per Unit Data) 

Overview 
  Net income decreased   $86.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to a $56.3 million gain in 2015 associated with the Linden Acquisition and a decrease of   $21.0 million   in segment operating income, resulting mainly from reductions in operating income for the pipeline and fuels marketing segments.

Pipeline  
  Total revenues decreased   $15.1 million   and total throughputs decreased   65,810   barrels per day for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $30.1 million and a decrease in throughputs of 86,059 barrels per day on our Eagle Ford System due to reduced production resulting from a sustained low crude oil price environment. Revenues also decreased $7.7 million and throughputs decreased 9,084 barrels per day on our Ammonia Pipeline partly due to a shipper s facility reconfiguration, resulting in fewer barrels available for transportation and maintenance downtime on a portion of the pipeline. 
    
  Those decreases in pipeline revenues and throughputs were partially offset by: 
             
    an increase in revenues of $9.9 million and an increase in throughputs of 17,283 barrels per day on our East Pipeline mainly due to the completion of expansion projects in the fourth quarter of 2015, higher average tariffs resulting from the annual index adjustment in July 2015, as well as lower throughput in 2015 due to maintenance downtime on a portion of the pipeline; 
                
    an increase in revenues of $9.4 million and an increase in throughputs of 10,172 barrels per day on our McKee System crude and refined products pipelines due to increased production at the McKee refinery, higher average tariffs from the annual index adjustment in July 2015 and increased volumes on pipelines with higher average tariffs; and 
                
    an increase in revenues of $4.3 million and an increase in throughputs of 2,034 barrels per day on our North Pipeline due to increased refinery production shipped via pipeline, higher average tariffs resulting from the annual index adjustment in July 2015 and increased long-haul deliveries. 
       
  Operating expenses decreased   $2.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower rental and power costs of $3.8 million mainly on our South Texas Crude System and lower environmental costs of $1.4 million mainly on our Three Rivers System. The decrease in pipeline operating expenses was partially offset by higher maintenance and regulatory expenses of $3.5 million, mainly on our Ammonia Pipeline. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $2.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to the completion of pipeline projects. 
    
  Storage  
  Total storage segment revenues decreased   $8.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to decreases in throughput terminal revenues of   $10.1 million  , partially offset by increases in storage terminal revenues of   $2.0 million  . 
    
  Throughput terminal revenues decreased   $10.1 million   and throughputs decreased   114,543   barrels per day for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease in revenues of $9.4 million and a decrease in throughputs of 87,204 barrels per day at our Corpus Christi North Beach terminal due to a decrease in Eagle Ford Shale crude oil being shipped to Corpus Christi, consistent with the decrease in pipeline throughputs; and 
                
    a decrease in revenues of $2.9 million and a decrease in throughputs of 39,245 barrels per day due to turnarounds at the refineries served by our Benicia and Corpus Christi crude oil storage tank facilities, as well as operational issues at a customer s Corpus Christi refinery in 2016. 
       
  The decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue of $2.2 million and an increase in throughputs of 6,296 barrels per day at our McKee and Three Rivers system terminals due to increased production at the McKee refinery combined with higher demand in those markets.  
    
  Storage terminal revenues increased   $2.0 million   primarily due to an increase of $11.8 million in domestic revenues, mainly from rate escalations, new customer contracts and higher throughput and related handling fees at our Selby, CA, St. James, LA, Linden, NJ, Blue Island, IL and Piney Point, MD terminals. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $4.5 million at our St. Eustatius terminal, mainly due to lower throughput and related handling fees and reimbursable revenues. In addition, revenues decreased $5.4 million at our UK and Amsterdam terminals mainly resulting from the negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 
    
  Operating expenses decreased   $13.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease of $11.3 million in operating expenses at our St. Eustatius terminal facility, mainly associated with higher property taxes in 2015, and lower regulatory, maintenance and reimbursable expenses in 2016; and 
                
    a decrease of $2.4 million at our Linden terminals mainly due to a property tax valuation adjustment.

Fuels Marketing  
  Segment operating income decreased   $10.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease of $4.9 million in operating income from our fuel oil operations, resulting mainly from lower product margins. In addition, operating income from our bunker fuel operations decreased $3.3 million, primarily attributable to lower product margins at our Texas City terminal location. 
    
  Consolidation and Intersegment Eliminations 
  Revenue and operating expense eliminations primarily relate to storage fees charged to the fuels marketing segment by the storage segment. Cost of product sales eliminations represent expenses charged to the fuels marketing segment for costs associated with inventory that are expensed once the inventory is sold. 
    
  General  
  General and administrative expenses decreased   $2.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in employee benefit costs and lower compensation expense associated with our long-term incentive plan. 
    
  Interest expense, net increased   $5.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased interest costs associated with higher borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, as well as lower capitalized interest resulting from fewer capital projects. 
    
  Other income totaled   $61.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to a $56.3 million gain associated with the Linden Acquisition and a $4.0 million net foreign exchange gain recognized in 2015. 

TRENDS AND OUTLOOK 
    
  We believe that the fact that NuStar provides both storage and pipeline services, for crude and refined products, to customers in sectors across the energy industry, throughout the country and around the world, offers some insulation from the impact of market fluctuations on our results of operations. Since high crude oil prices have tended to benefit our producer customers, high prices have also correlated with increased demand for our crude oil pipeline services. On the other hand, depressed crude oil prices, when coupled with an industry expectation of higher prices in the future, or a contango market, has historically correlated with increased demand from trading companies for our storage services. 
    
  Because of the geographic diversity of our assets, our results of operations are not dependent on the regions or markets that have been hardest hit by depressed crude oil prices, the domestic shale play regions, which was demonstrated by the fact that, in 2015, revenue from our Eagle Ford pipeline and storage assets constituted less than 16% of our total pipeline and storage segment revenue. Although our assets in the Eagle Ford region have experienced lower throughputs as production has slowed, the fact that we have minimum volume throughput contracts with large, creditworthy customers has minimized the negative impact of that slowdown on our results of operations. 
    
  In addition to the diversity of our customers, our assets, the services we offer and the markets we serve, we believe our contracts, many of which are long-term, take-or-pay arrangements for committed storage or throughput capacity, also help to blunt the impact of volatility of crude oil prices on our results of operations. In the locations at which our assets are integrated physically with the refineries the assets serve, we believe the results generated by those assets depend to a greater degree on the refinery s continuing need to receive, store and transport the crude and refined products than on crude or refined product prices. 
    
  Pipeline Segment 
  We expect earnings for our pipeline segment to benefit from higher forecasted volumes on our refined product pipelines. However, we expect these increases to be more than offset by reduced throughput volumes on our Eagle Ford crude pipelines due to lower shale production in the South Texas region. Due to this reduction in volumes, we expect fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results to be lower than the comparable periods of 2015. 
    
  Storage Segment 
  We expect earnings at many of our terminals to benefit from favorable storage contract renewals and higher forecasted throughput volumes, but we expect these increases to be more than offset by higher maintenance expenses and lower throughputs at our Corpus Christi North Beach terminal.  We expect lower earnings in the fourth quarter 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, and comparable or higher earnings for the full-year 2016, as compared to 2015.

Fuels Marketing Segment 
  Although we expect full-year 2016 results to be lower than 2015 for our fuels marketing segment, fourth quarter 2016 results are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter 2015 due to our bunker fuel operations. However, earnings in this segment, as in any margin-based business, are subject to many factors that can increase or reduce margins, which may cause the segment s actual results to vary significantly from our forecast. 
    
  Our outlook for the partnership, both overall and for any of our segments, may change, as we base our expectations on our continuing evaluation of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the state of the economy and the capital markets, changes to our customers  refinery maintenance schedules and unplanned refinery downtime, supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and anhydrous ammonia, demand for our transportation and storage services and changes in laws or regulations affecting our assets. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Overview 
  Primary Cash Requirements.   Our primary cash requirements are for distributions to our partners, capital expenditures, debt service and operating expenses. 
    
  Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all  Available Cash  to our partners each quarter, and this term is defined in the partnership agreement as cash on hand at the end of the quarter, plus certain permitted borrowings made subsequent to the end of the quarter, less cash reserves determined by our board of directors. 
    
  Sources of Funds.   Each year, our objective is to fund our total annual reliability capital expenditures and distribution requirements with our net cash provided by operating activities during that year. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations to meet that objective, we utilize cash on hand or other sources of cash flow, which in the past have primarily included borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, sales of non-strategic assets and, to the extent necessary, funds raised through equity or debt offerings under our shelf registration statements. We have typically funded our strategic capital expenditures and acquisitions from external sources, primarily borrowings under our revolving credit agreement or funds raised through equity or debt offerings. However, our ability to raise funds by issuing debt or equity depends on many factors beyond our control. Our risk factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describe the risks inherent to these sources of funding and the availability thereof. 
    
  During periods when our cash flow from operations is less than our distribution and reliability capital requirements, we may maintain our distribution level because we can utilize other sources of Available Cash, as provided in our partnership agreement, including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and proceeds from the sales of assets. Our risk factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describe the risks inherent in our ability to maintain or grow our distribution.  
    
  For 2016, we currently expect to generate cash from operations in excess of our distribution and reliability capital requirements. 
    
  Cash Flows for the   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 

Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $314.5 million  , compared to   $376.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to lower net income in 2016. In addition, our working capital increased by   $12.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a decrease of   $19.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . See  Working Capital Requirements  below. 
  
    38 

Table of Contents  

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand was used to fund our distributions to unitholders and our general partner in the aggregate amount of   $294.2 million   and reliability capital expenditures of   $25.8 million  . The proceeds from debt borrowings, net of repayments, proceeds from the issuance of common units and cash on hand were used to fund our strategic capital expenditures. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by operating activities was used to fund our distributions to unitholders and our general partner and reliability capital expenditures. Proceeds from debt borrowings, net of repayments, combined with cash on hand, were used to fund our strategic capital expenditures, including the Linden Acquisition. 
    
  Revolving Credit Agreement  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated debt coverage ratio (as defined in our revolving credit agreement) cannot exceed 5.00-to-1.00. The requirement not to exceed a maximum consolidated debt coverage ratio may limit the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit agreement to an amount less than the total amount available for borrowing. As of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated debt coverage ratio was   4.6  x, and we had   $491.9 million   available for borrowing. Letters of credit issued under our revolving credit agreement totaled   $15.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Please refer to Note 3 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion on our revolving credit agreement. 
    
  Issuance of Common Units 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   595,050   common units representing limited partner interests at an average price of   $47.39   per unit for proceeds of   $28.3 million  , net of   $0.5 million   of issuance costs. We used these proceeds, which includes a contribution of   $0.6 million   from our general partner to maintain its   2%   general partner interest, for general partnership purposes, including repayments of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. 
    
  Other Sources of Liquidity 
  Other sources of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   consist of the following: 
              
    a $125.0 million receivables financing agreement between NuStar Energy, NuStar Finance LLC and third-party lenders (the Receivables Financing Agreement), with the amount available for borrowing based on the availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors and conditions; and  
                
    a short-term line of credit agreement with an uncommitted borrowing capacity of up to $40.0 million, with   $7.0 million   of borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Please refer to Note 3 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of certain of our debt agreements. 
    
  LOC Agreement 
  NuStar Logistics is a party to a $100.0 million uncommitted letter of credit agreement, which provides for standby letters of credit or guarantees with a term of up to one year (LOC Agreement). As of   September 30, 2016  , letters of credit issued under the LOC Agreement totaled $9.0 million.  
    
  Capital Requirements 
  Our operations require significant investments to maintain, upgrade or enhance the operating capacity of our existing assets. Our capital expenditures consist of: 
             
    reliability capital expenditures, such as those required to maintain the existing operating capacity of existing assets or extend their useful lives, as well as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety; and 
                
    strategic capital expenditures, such as those to expand or upgrade the operating capacity, increase efficiency or increase the earnings potential of existing assets, whether through construction or acquisition, as well as certain capital expenditures related to support functions.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes our capital expenditures, and the amount we expect to spend for 2016: 

(a) 
    Excludes the amount we expect to spend on the Martin Terminal Acquisition of approximately $93.0 million, net. 
       
  Strategic capital expenditures mainly include projects associated with the conversion and expansion of existing assets. In 2015, our strategic capital expenditures primarily related to the Linden Acquisition, projects associated with the Eagle Ford Shale region in South Texas and the reactivation and conversion of our 200-mile pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Corpus Christi, Texas. Reliability capital expenditures in 2016 mainly include maintenance upgrade projects at our terminals while in 2015, our reliability capital expenditures also included dry-docking costs on one of our marine vessels.  
    
  For the full year   2016  , we continue to evaluate our capital budget and make changes as economic conditions warrant, and our actual capital expenditures for   2016   may increase or decrease from the budgeted amounts.  In the first quarter of 2016, largely in response to market conditions, we reduced our strategic capital expenditures expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016   by approximately 50%. We believe we can fund our currently expected capital expenditures with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our internal growth projects can be accelerated or scaled back depending on market conditions or customer demand. 
    
  Working Capital Requirements 
  Working capital requirements, particularly in our fuels marketing segment, may vary with the seasonality of demand and the volatility of commodity prices for the products we market. This seasonality in demand and the volatility of commodity prices affect our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances, which vary depending on the timing of payments.

  Management believes that, as of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with the ratios and covenants contained under our debt instruments. A default under certain of our debt agreements would be considered an event of default under other of our debt instruments. Please refer to Note 3 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of certain of our debt agreements. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were a party to forward-starting interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate notional amount of these forward-starting interest rate swaps was   $600.0 million  .

Environmental, Health and Safety  
  We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures, among others. Our operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to worker and pipeline safety, pipeline integrity and operator qualifications. Because more stringent environmental and safety laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental, health and safety matters is expected to increase in the future. 
    
  Contingencies 
  We are subject to certain loss contingencies, the outcomes of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations, as further disclosed in Note 4 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements.   

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Please refer to Note 7 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of our related party transactions. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . We adopted the following accounting policy in connection with the Employee Transfer, and we consider this policy critical due to judgments made by management and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in actual results from management s assumptions. 
    
  Defined Benefit Plans 
  We estimate pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs based on actuarial valuations. The annual measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is December 31. The actuarial valuations require the use of certain assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and expected rates of compensation increase. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. The discount rate is based on a hypothetical yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the hypothetical yield curve required an average rating of double-A, when averaging all available ratings by Moody s Investor Service Inc., Standard   Poor s Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc. The resulting discount rates were 4.61% and 4.75% for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for each asset class of investments held in our plans as determined using historical data and the assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. The expected rate of compensation increase represents average long-term salary increases.  
    
  These assumptions can have an effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. The effect of a 0.25% change in the specified assumptions would have the following effects (in thousands): 
                       
    Pension  
  Benefits

     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt. In addition, we utilize forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to forecasted debt issuances. Borrowings under our variable-rate debt expose us to increases in interest rates.  
    
  Please refer to Note 6 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps. The following tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our long-term debt:     

The following table presents information regarding our forward-starting interest rate swap agreements:

Table of Contents  

Commodity Price Risk 
  Since the operations of our fuels marketing segment expose us to commodity price risk, we use derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations. The derivative instruments we use consist primarily of commodity futures and swap contracts. We have a risk management committee that oversees our trading policies and procedures and certain aspects of risk management. Our risk management committee also reviews all new risk management strategies in accordance with our risk management policy, as approved by our board of directors. 
  We record commodity derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We recognize mark-to-market adjustments for derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges (Fair Value Hedges) and the related change in the fair value of the associated hedged physical inventory or firm commitment within  Cost of product sales.  For derivative instruments that have associated underlying physical inventory but do not qualify for hedge accounting (Economic Hedges and Other Derivatives), we record the mark-to-market adjustments in  Cost of product sales.   
  The commodity contracts disclosed below represent only those contracts exposed to commodity price risk at the end of the period. Please refer to Note 6 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for the volume and related fair value of all commodity contracts.
