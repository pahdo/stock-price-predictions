NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Lithium  Corporation  (formerly Utalk  Communications  Inc.) (the "Company") was
incorporated  on January 30,  2007 under the laws of Nevada.  On  September  30,
2009, Utalk Communications Inc. changed its name to Lithium Corporation.

Nevada Lithium  Corporation was incorporated on March 16, 2009 under the laws of
Nevada under the name Lithium  Corporation.  On September 10, 2009,  the Company
amended  its  articles  of  incorporation  to change its name to Nevada  Lithium
Corporation.  By agreement dated October 9, 2009 Nevada Lithium  Corporation and
Lithium Corporation  amalgamated as Lithium Corporation.  Lithium Corporation is
engaged in the acquisition  and development of certain lithium  interests in the
state of  Nevada,  and flake  graphite  prospects  in  British  Columbia  and is
currently in the exploration stage.

Exploration Stage Company
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting  principles related to accounting and reporting by
exploration  stage  companies.  An  exploration  stage  company  is one in which
planned  principal  operations  have not  commenced  or if its  operations  have
commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from.

Accounting Basis
The Company  uses the accrual  basis of  accounting  and  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("GAAP"  accounting).  The
Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on account,  demand deposits, and short-term instruments with
maturities of three months or less.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit  accounts,  the balances of which
at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company  continually  monitors
its banking  relationships  and  consequently  has not experienced any losses in
such accounts.  The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition
The Company has yet to realize  revenues from  operations.  Once the Company has
commenced  operations,  it will  recognize  revenues  when  delivery of goods or
completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive  evidence of an
agreement,  acceptance has been approved by its  customers,  the fee is fixed or
determinable  based on the  completion  of  stated  terms  and  conditions,  and
collection of any related receivable is probable.

Loss per Share
Basic  loss  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  loss  available  to  common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares  outstanding during
the year. The computation of diluted  earnings per share assumes the conversion,
exercise  or  contingent  issuance  of  securities  only when  such  conversion,
exercise or issuance  would have a dilutive  effect on earnings  per share.  The
dilutive effect of convertible  securities is reflected in diluted  earnings per
share by  application of the "if  converted"  method.  In the periods in which a
loss is incurred,  the effect of potential issuances of shares under options and
warrants  would be  anti-dilutive,  and therefore  basic and diluted  losses per
share are the same.

                   Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements
                         September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Income Taxes
The  asset  and  liability  approach  is used to  account  for  income  taxes by
recognizing  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  for the  expected  future tax
consequences of temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities.

Financial Instruments
The  Company's  financial  instruments  consist  of cash,  deposits,  marketable
securities,  prepaid  expenses,  and accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities.
Unless  otherwise  noted,  it is  management's  opinion  that the Company is not
exposed to  significant  interest,  currency or credit risks  arising from these
financial  instruments.  Because of the short  maturity  and  capacity of prompt
liquidation of such assets and  liabilities,  the fair value of these  financial
instruments approximate their carrying values, unless otherwise noted.

Mineral Properties
Costs of exploration,  carrying and retaining  unproven mineral lease properties
are expensed as incurred.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs are capitalized
including  licenses and lease payments.  Although the Company has taken steps to
verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures
do not guarantee the Company's  title.  Such  properties may be subject to prior
agreements  or  transfers  and  title may be  affected  by  undetected  defects.
Impairment  losses are recorded on mineral  properties  used in operations  when
indicators of impairment are present and the  undiscounted  cash flows estimated
to be  generated  by those  assets are less than the  assets'  carrying  amount.
Impairment of $0 and $0 was recorded during the periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2016,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB"),  issued
Accounting  Standards  Update ("ASU")  2016-01,  "Financial  Instruments-Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,"  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally  accepted  accounting
principles  on the  classification  and  measurement  of financial  instruments.
Changes to the  current  guidance  primarily  affect the  accounting  for equity
investments,  financial  liabilities  under  the  fair  value  option,  and  the
presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition,
the ASU clarifies  guidance related to the valuation  allowance  assessment when
recognizing   deferred  tax  assets   resulting   from   unrealized   losses  on
available-for-sale  debt  securities.  The new standard is effective  for fiscal
years and interim  periods  beginning  after  December 15,  2017,  and are to be
adopted by means of a  cumulative-effect  adjustment to the balance sheet at the
beginning  of the first  reporting  period in which the  guidance is  effective.
Early  adoption is not  permitted  except for the provision to record fair value
changes for financial  liabilities  under the fair value option  resulting  from
instrument-specific  credit risk in other  comprehensive  income. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

In November  2015,  the FASB issued ASU  2015-17,  "Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):
Balance  Sheet   Classification   of  Deferred   Taxes,"  which  simplifies  the
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified  as  noncurrent in a classified  statement of financial
position.  This ASU is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for annual
periods  beginning  after  December 16, 2016,  and interim  periods within those
annual  periods.  The adoption of this  standard will not have any impact on the
Company's financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

a write-down is necessary with respect to the properties.  The Company  believes
no circumstances have occurred and no evidence has been uncovered that warrant a
write-down of the mineral  properties  other than those  abandoned by management
and thus  included in write-down of mineral  properties.  During the  year-ended
December 31, 2015, the Company recorded in impairment  charge of $21,494 related
to the properties.

to the option agreement.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

On March 15, 2013, all pre-existing  options were modified to exercise prices of
$0.045. The modification resulted in stock-based compensation of $8,848. Also on

price of $0.045 to  consultants  for  management  services.  These  options were

The  Company  uses the  Black-Scholes  option  valuation  model  to value  stock
options.  The  Black-Scholes  model was developed for use in estimating the fair

GENERAL OVERVIEW

We were  incorporated  under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2007
under the name "Utalk Communications Inc.". At inception,  we were a development
stage  corporation  engaged  in the  business  of  developing  and  marketing  a
call-back service using a call-back platform.  Because we were not successful in
implementing our business plan, we considered various alternatives to ensure the
viability and solvency of our company.

On August 31,  2009,  we entered  into a letter of intent  with  Nevada  Lithium
Corporation  regarding a business  combination which could be effected in one of
several different ways,  including an asset  acquisition,  merger of our company
and Nevada Lithium,  or a share exchange whereby we would purchase the shares of
Nevada Lithium from its  shareholders  in exchange for restricted  shares of our
common stock.

Effective September 30, 2009, we effected a 1 old for 60 new forward stock split
of our issued and outstanding  common stock. As a result, our authorized capital
increased from  50,000,000  shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to
3,000,000,000  shares of common  stock  with a par value of $0.001  and our then
issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,470,000 shares of common stock to
268,200,000 shares of common stock.

Also   effective   September   30,  2009,   we  changed  our  name  from  "Utalk
Communications,  Inc." to  "Lithium  Corporation",  by way of a merger  with our
wholly owned  subsidiary  Lithium  Corporation,  which was formed solely for the
change of name.  The name change and forward stock split became  effective  with
the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin  Board at the  opening for trading on October 1,
2009 under the stock symbol "LTUM". Our CUSIP number is 536804 107.

                                       15
 
On October 9, 2009,  we entered  into a share  exchange  agreement  with  Nevada
Lithium and the shareholders of Nevada Lithium.  The closing of the transactions
contemplated  in the share exchange  agreement and the acquisition of all of the
issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Nevada Lithium occurred on
October  19,  2009.  In  accordance  with  the  closing  of the  share  exchange
agreement,  we  issued  12,350,000  shares  of our  common  stock to the  former
shareholders of Nevada Lithium in exchange for the acquisition,  by our company,
of all of the 12,350,000 issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Lithium.  Also,
pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, a director of our company
cancelled  220,000,000  restricted shares of our common stock.  Nevada Lithium's
corporate  status was allowed to lapse and the company's  status with the Nevada
Secretary of State has been revoked.

In April of 2016 our  company  established  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  called
Lithium  Royalty Corp. The subsidiary is a Nevada  Corporation and is the entity
in which we plan to build a portfolio of lithium mineral property royalties.

OUR CURRENT BUSINESS

We are an  exploration  stage  mining  company  engaged  in the  identification,
acquisition,  and  exploration  of metals and  minerals  with a focus on lithium
mineralization  on  properties  located in Nevada,  and graphite  properties  in
British Columbia.

Our current operational focus is to monitor exploration progress of our partners
on our Fish Lake  Valley  and San  Emidio  projects,  generate  new  exploration
properties focusing primarily on Nevada, and conduct  exploration  activities on
those new prospects and on the BC Sugar property in British Columbia.

We are currently  evaluating the opportunities that the Summa lands present (the
Hughes Claims),  while also evaluating  opportunities  brought to our company by
third parties.

Effective  April 23,  2014,  we entered  into an  operating  agreement  with All
American Resources,  L.L.C and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa,
LLC, a Nevada  limited  liability  company  incorporated  on December  12, 2013,
wherein we hold a 25% membership.  Our company's capital  contribution to Summa,
LLC was $125,000,  of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To
date we have contributed an additional $16,700 to Summa, LLC.

Effective  August 15, 2014,  we entered into an asset  purchase  agreement  with
Pathion,  Inc.,  a Delaware  corporation,  and  Pathion  Mining  Inc.,  a Nevada
corporation.  Pursuant to the Agreement,  we agreed to sell to Pathion, Inc. and
Pathion  Mining,  our  rights,  interests  and assets  relating to our Fish Lake
Valley, San Emidio and BC Sugar properties. The asset purchase agreement was set
to close at the end of September  2014,  but was extended to October 17, 2014 by
mutual agreement, and was further extended until January 19, 2015. After Pathion
failed to close the agreement within the agreed upon extended timeframe, we gave
notice on January 27, 2015 of the  termination of the asset  purchase  agreement
entered into on August 15, 2014.

On  February  20,  2015,  our company  signed a letter of intent with  Kingsmere
Mining  Ltd.,  which  is  the  preliminary  step  whereby  Kingsmere,  or  their
appointee, may choose to buy or option our company's lithium brine properties in
Nevada.  The letter allowed for a due diligence and election  period until April
1, 2015 with closing by April 15,  2015.  The terms of the letter of intent with
Kingsmere were subsequently  extended to May 31, 2015. Our company and Kingsmere
were not able to reach an agreement and a press release notifying the public was
issued on June 23, 2015.

On February 16, 2016, we issued a news release  announcing  that our company has
entered into a letter of intent with 1032701 B.C.  Ltd. with respect to our Fish
Lake Valley lithium brine  property in Esmeralda  County,  Nevada.  On March 10,
2016 we issued a news  release  announcing  the  signing of the Fish Lake Valley
Earn-In  Agreement.  The terms of the Earn-In Agreement allow 1032701 to earn an
80% interest in Fish Lake Valley for payments over two years  totaling  $300,000
and issuance of 400,000 common shares of the publicly traded company anticipated
to result from a Going Public  Transaction,  and work  performed on the property
over three  years in the amount of  $1,100,000.  1032701  then has a  Subsequent
Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation's  remaining 20% working interest
within one year of earning the 80% by paying the  Company a further  $1,000,000,
at that point the Company would retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which
may be purchased by 1032701 for an additional  $1,000,000.  Should the Purchaser
elect  not  to  exercise  the  Subsequent  Earn-In,  a  joint  venture  will  be

                                       16
 
established.  During the Joint  Venture,  should either party be diluted below a
10% working  interest - their interest in the property will revert to a 7.5% Net
Smelter Royalty. The first tranche of cash and shares are to be issued within 60
days of the signing of the formal  agreement.  Menika Mining,  a publicly traded
company on the TSX Venture  Exchange  trading  under the symbol MML announced on
March 8, 2016 that it  intended  to acquire  1032701  B.C.  Ltd and the right to
acquire the Fish Lake Valley  Property.  Menika Mining completed the acquisition
of  1032701  and  fulfilled  the  initial  obligations  of the Fish Lake  Valley
Earn-In-Agreement in April of 2016.

In April of 2016 our  company  established  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  called
Lithium  Royalty Corp. The subsidiary is a Nevada  Corporation and is the entity
in which we plan to build a portfolio  of lithium  mineral  property  royalties.
Also in April of 2016  Lithium  Royalty  Corp.  gained 100% control of a lithium
property  consisting  of a block of  mineral  claims  named the North Big Smokey
Property.

On May 11, 2016, we issued a news release  announcing that effective May 3, 2016
our company has entered in to an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C.
Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property.  The terms of the formal agreement
are;  payment of  $100,000,  issuance of 300,000  common  shares of 1067323 B.C.
Ltd.,  or of the  publicly  traded  company  anticipated  to result from a Going
Public  Transaction,  and work  performed on the property by the Optionee in the
amount of  $600,000  over the next three  years to earn an 80%  interest  in the
property.  1067323  then has a  subsequent  Earn-In  option to purchase  Lithium
Corporation's  remaining 20% working  interest within three years of earning the
80% by paying our company a further $1,000,000,  at that point our company would
retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which may be purchased by 1067323 for
an  additional  $1,000,000.  Should  the  Purchaser  elect not to  exercise  the
Subsequent  Earn-In,  a joint venture will be established.  The first tranche of
cash and  shares  are to be issued  within 30 days of the  signing of the formal
agreement.

On May 13, 2016 our wholly  owned  subsidiary  sold 100% of the  interest in the
North Big Smokey  Property  through a Property  Acquisition  Agreement  with the
private company 1069934 Nevada Ltd. ("Purchaser"). Consideration paid to Lithium
Royalty Corp. consisted of $10,000.00, reimbursement of staking and filing fees,
300,000 shares in the "Purchaser  Parent",  1069934 B.C. Ltd.,  Lithium  Royalty
Corp. retained a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty ("Vendor NSR") on the North Big Smokey
Property and the Purchaser has the right to purchase up to one-half (50%) of the
Vendor NSR for $1,000,000 to reduce the Vendor NSR to 1.25%.

Our company intends to continue  generating  additional lithium brine properties
in Nevada and conduct  exploration  on our BC Sugar flake  graphite  property in
British Columbia, while tracking progress at Fish Lake Valley and San Emidio and
also determining further plans of action with respect to our Mount Heimdal flake
graphite  property in British Columbia.  We will continue  assessing our options
with respect to our 25% interest in Summa, LLC, a private Nevada company,  which
holds the residue of the "Howard  Hughes"  Summa  Corp.,  while  generating  new
prospects and evaluating property submittals for option or purchase.

FISH LAKE VALLEY PROPERTY

Fish Lake Valley is a lithium  enriched  playa  (also known as a salar,  or salt
pan), which is located in northern  Esmeralda County in west central Nevada, and
the  property  is roughly  centered  at  417050E  4195350N  (NAD 27  CONUS).  We
currently hold forty, 80-acre Association Placer claims that cover approximately
3,200 acres (1280 hectares).  Lithium-enriched  Tertiary-era Fish Lake formation
rhyolitic  tuffs or ash flow  tuffs  have  accumulated  in a valley  or  basinal
environment.  Over time  interstitial  formational  waters in contact with these
tuffs, have become enriched in lithium, boron and potassium which could possibly
be amenable to extraction by evaporative  methods. Our company allowed 56 claims
to lapse on September 1, 2012,  which  covered the  southern  playa area.  These
claims  were  allowed to lapse as it was  determined  through the course of work
over the past  three  years  that they are not overly  prospective  for  hosting
lithium brine  resources,  nor is it  strategically  advantageous to continue to
hold them.

The property was  originally  held under mining lease purchase  agreement  dated
June 1, 2009, between Nevada Lithium  Corporation,  and Nevada Alaska Mining Co.
Inc., Robert Craig, Barbara Craig, and Elizabeth Dickman.  Nevada Lithium issued
to the vendors  $350,000  worth of common stock of our company in eight  regular
disbursements.  All disbursements  were made of stock worth a total of $350,000,
and claim ownership was transferred to our company.

The geological  setting at Fish Lake Valley is highly analogous to the salars of
Chile,  Bolivia,  and Peru, and more importantly Clayton Valley, where Albemarle
has its Silver Peak  lithium-brine  operation.  Access is excellent in Fish Lake

                                       17
 
Valley with all-weather gravel roads leading to the property from state highways
264, and 265,  and  maintained  gravel roads ring the playa.  Power is available
approximately  10  miles  from  the  property,   and  the  village  of  Dyer  is
approximately  12 miles to the  south,  while  the town of  Tonopah,  Nevada  is
approximately 50 miles to the east.

Our company  completed a number of geochemical  and  geophysical  studies on the
property,  and  conducted a short drill program on the periphery of the playa in
the fall of 2010. Near-surface brine sampling during the spring of 2011 outlined
a  boron/lithium/potassium  anomaly on the  northern  portions  of the  northern
playa, that is roughly 1.3 x 2 miles long, which has a smaller higher grade core
where lithium  mineralization  ranges from 100 to 150 mg/L (average 122.5 mg/L),
with boron ranging from 1,500 to 2,670 mg/L (average 2,219 mg/L),  and potassium
from 5,400 to 8,400 mg/L  (average  7,030  mg/L).  Wet  conditions  on the playa
precluded  drilling  there in 2011,  and for a good  portion of 2012,  however a
window of opportunity  presented itself in late fall 2012. In  November/December
2012 we conducted a short  direct push drill  program on the northern end of the
playa,  wherein a total of 1,240.58 feet (378.09 meters) was drilled in 20 holes
at 17 discrete  sites,  and an area of 3,356 feet  (1,023  meters) by 2,776 feet
(846 meters) was systematically  explored by grid probing.  The deepest hole was
81 feet (24.69 meters),  and the shallowest hole that produced brine was 34 feet
(10.36 meters). The average depth of the holes drilled during the program was 62
feet   (18.90   meters).    The   program    successfully    demonstrated   that
lithium-boron-potassium-enriched  brines exist to at least 62 feet (18.9 meters)
depth in sandy or silty aquifers that vary from approximately  three to ten feet
(one to three  meters)  in  thickness.  Average  lithium,  boron  and  potassium
contents of all samples are 47.05  mg/L,  992.7 mg/L,  and 0.535%  respectively,
with lithium values ranging from 7.6 mg/L to 151.3 mg/L,  boron ranging from 146
to 2,160.7 mg/L, and potassium ranging from 0.1 to 1.3%. The anomaly outlined by
the program is 1,476 by 2,461 feet (450 meters by 750 meters),  and is not fully
delimited,  as the area  available for probing was restricted due to soft ground
conditions  to the east and to the south.  A 50 mg/L  lithium  cutoff is used to
define this anomaly and within this zone average  lithium,  boron and  potassium
contents are 90.97 mg/L, 1,532.92 mg/L, and 0.88% respectively.  On September 3,
2013,  we  announced  that  drilling had  commenced at Fish Lake Valley.  Due to
storms and wet conditions in the area which our company hoped to concentrate on,
the playa was not passable,  and so the program  concentrated on larger step-out
drilling  well off the playa.  This 11 hole,  1,025 foot  program did prove that
mineralization  does not extend much,  if at all, past the margins of the playa,
as none of the fluids  encountered in this program were particularly  briny, and
returned values of less than 5 mg/L lithium.

Our company is very pleased with the results  here,  and believes that the playa
at Fish Lake Valley may be conducive to the  formation of a "silver  peak" style
lithium  brine  deposit.  Our  company  reviewed  the  results in regards to the
overall  geological  interpretation of the lithium,  boron and potassium bearing
strata. The results confirm the presence of targeted  mineralization and further
evaluation   programs  will  focus  on  determining  the  extent  and  depth  of
mineralization.  Our  company  is  currently  assessing  options  on how best to
further explore here.

We have signed an  Exploration  Earn-In  Agreement  with  1032701  B.C.  LTD., a
private  British  Columbia  company with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium
brine property.

1032701 BC Ltd., may acquire an initial 80% undivided  interest in the Fish Lake
Valley  property  through the payment of an  aggregate  of  US$300,000  in cash,
completing a Going Public  Transaction  on or before May 6, 2016, and subject to
the completion of the Going Public Transaction,  arranging for the issuance of a
total of  400,000  common  shares  in the  capital  of the  Resulting  Issuer as
follows: (i) within five Business Days following the effective date,

     *    Pay  $100,000 to our company and issue  200,000  common  shares of the
          TSX-V listed public company.
     *    On or before the first  anniversary  of the signing of the  Definitive
          Agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000  common shares
          of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company.
     *    On or before the second  anniversary  of the signing of the definitive
          agreement pay $100,000 to our company and issue 100,000  common shares
          of the Optionee/TSX-V listed public company.

The Optionee must make qualified exploration or development  expenditures on the
property of $200,000 before the first anniversary, an additional $300,000 before
the second  anniversary,  an additional $600,000 prior to the third anniversary,
and make all  payments  and perform all other acts to maintain  the  Property in
good standing before fully earning their 80% interest.  Additionally, terms will
be negotiated  for the Optionee to purchase our 20% interest in the property for

                                       18
 
$1,000,000, at which point the our interest would revert to a 2 1/2% Net Smelter
Royalty  (NSR).  The Optionee may then elect at any time to purchase one half of
our NSR for $1,000,000.

On April 7, 2106,  1032701 B.C. Ltd. was acquired by Menika  Mining Ltd.,  which
subsequently changed its name to American Lithium Corp.(TSXV:  LI) In connection
with the acquisition of 1032701 and in accordance  with the Exploration  Earn-In
Agreement,  200,000  common shares were issued to our company.  In addition,  we
received payment of $130,000.

American Lithium is conducting an ongoing  exploration  program on our Fish Lake
Valley claim package as well as other land around our claims.  Surface  sampling
and  limited  drilling  has been  conducted  and  results  have been made public
through press releases made by American Lithium. We expect to receive a complete
accounting of exploration  done on our claims as well as the associated  data in
early 2017.

SAN EMIDIO PROPERTY

The San Emidio property,  located in Washoe County in northwestern  Nevada,  was
acquired  through the staking of claims in September 2011. The twenty,  80-acre,
Association  Placer claims  currently  held here cover an area of  approximately
1,600 acres (640 hectares).  Ten claims in the southern portions of the original
claim block that was staked in 2011 were  allowed to lapse on September 1, 2012,
and a further  ten claims were then  staked and  recorded.  These new claims are
north of and  contiguous to the  surviving  claims from our earlier  block.  The
property is  approximately 65 miles  north-northeast  of Reno,  Nevada,  and has
excellent infrastructure.

We developed this prospect during 2009, and 2010 through surface  sampling,  and
the early  reconnaissance  sampling determined that anomalous values for lithium
occur in the playa  sediments  over a good portion of the playa.  This  sampling
appeared to indicate that the most prospective  areas on the playa may be on the
newly staked block  proximal to the  southern  margin of the basin,  where it is
possible the structures that are responsible for the geothermal  system here may
also have influenced lithium deposition in sediments.

Our company conducted  near-surface  brine sampling in the spring of 2011, and a
high resolution gravity geophysical survey in summer/fall 2011. Our company then
permitted a 7 hole drilling  program with the Bureau of Land  Management in late
fall 2011, and a direct push drill program was commenced in early February 2012.
Drilling here  delineated a narrow  elongated  shallow brine  reservoir which is
greater  than 2.5 miles  length,  and  which is  adjacent  to a basinal  feature
outlined by the earlier gravity survey.  Two values of over 20  milligrams/liter
lithium were obtained from two holes located centrally in this brine anomaly.

Most recently we drilled this prospect in late October 2012, further testing the
area of the  property in the  vicinity  where prior  exploration  by our company
discovered elevated lithium levels in subsurface brines. During the 2012 program
a total of 856 feet (260.89 meters) was drilled at 8 discrete sites. The deepest
hole was 160 feet (48.76  meters),  and the shallowest  hole that produced brine
was 90 feet (27.43 meters).  The average depth of the seven hole program was 107
feet (32.61 meters). The program better defined a lithium-in-brine  anomaly that
was  discovered  in early 2012.  This  anomaly is  approximately  0.6 miles (370
meters) wide at its widest point by more than 2 miles (3  kilometers)  long. The
peak value seen within the anomaly is 23.7 mg/l lithium, which is 10 to 20 times
background levels outside the anomaly. Our company believes that, much like Fish
Lake  Valley,  the playa at San Emidio may be  conducive  to the  formation of a
"Silver Peak" style lithium brine  deposit,  and the recent  drilling  indicates
that the anomaly occurs at or near the  intersection  of several faults that may
have  provided  the  structural   setting  necessary  for  the  formation  of  a
lithium-in-brine deposit at depth.

We have signed an  Exploration  Earn-In  Agreement  with 1067323 B.C.  Ltd. with
respect to our San Emidio property.

1067323  B.C.  Ltd.,  may acquire an initial 80%  undivided  interest in the San
Emidio  property  through the payment of an  aggregate  of  US$100,000  in cash,
completing a Going Public Transaction and subject to the completion of the Going
Public  Transaction,  arranging  for the  issuance of a total of 300,000  common
shares in the capital of the Resulting Issuer as follows:

     *    Within 30 days of the  Effective  Date pay $100,000 to our company and
          issue 100,000 common shares of the TSX-V listed public company.

                                       19
 
     *    On or before the first  anniversary  of the signing of the  Definitive
          Agreement  issue 100,000  common shares of the  Optionee/TSX-V  listed
          public company.
     *    On or before the second  anniversary  of the signing of the definitive
          agreement  issue 100,000  common shares of the  Optionee/TSX-V  listed
          public company.

The Optionee must make qualified exploration or development  expenditures on the
property of $100,000 before the first anniversary, an additional $200,000 before
the second  anniversary,  an additional $300,000 prior to the third anniversary,
and make all  payments  and perform all other acts to maintain  the  Property in
good standing  before fully earning their 80% interest.  Additionally,  Optionee
has the right to purchase our 20% interest in the  property for  $1,000,000,  at
which point the our interest would revert to a 2 1/2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR).
The  Optionee  may then  elect at any time to  purchase  one half of our NSR for
$1,000,000.

On May 24, 2016, 1067323 B.C. Ltd. was acquired by American Lithium  Corp.(TSXV:
LI) In connection  with the  acquisition  of 1067323 and in accordance  with the
Exploration Earn-In Agreement, 100,000 common shares were issued to our company.
In addition, we received payment of $100,000.

MOUNT HEIMDAL FLAKE GRAPHITE PROPERTY

On April 15, 2013, we entered into a mining option  agreement with, Tom Lewis, a
director and former officer of our company, wherein we had the option to acquire
a 100%  interest  in the Mount  Heimdal  Flake  Graphite  property in the Slocan
Mining Division of British Columbia, Canada.

The Mount Heimdal  property is comprised of one mineral claims,  which encompass
292.59 acres  (118.4  hectares) of highly  metamorphosed  rock.  The property is
roughly six miles (10 kms) south of Eagle Graphite's  Black Crystal quarry,  and
is located within the same package of gneisses,  graphite  mineralized  marbles,
and calc-silicate  gneisses.  Data from BC Geological Survey assessment  reports
indicate that mineralization  grading up to 4.8% graphitic carbon may be located
on the property.

Pursuant  to the terms of the  original  agreement,  we were  required  to spend
$15,000 in  exploration  on the property and  complete an  assessment  report by
November 30, 2013, and upon successful completion of the program and the report,
our  company was to earn a 100%  interest  in the claims,  subject to a 1.5% net
overriding royalty to the vendor from the proceeds of production.

Prospecting  work was performed on the Mount Heimdal  property in June/July 2013
and several  mineralized  zones were noted here,  the best of which graded 3.72%
flake  graphite.  In August 2014, an  exploration  crew was mobilized to further
explore the Mount Heimdal flake graphite property.  The program focused on flake
graphite  mineralization  discovered  on the property  during the brief  program
undertaken in 2013,  while  exploring other areas of the property that were felt
to also be  prospective  for hosting flake graphite  mineralization.  No further
significant mineralization was found, and our company is considering options for
this property moving forward.

BC SUGAR FLAKE GRAPHITE PROPERTY

On June 6, 2013, we entered into a mining claim sale  agreement  with Herb Hyder
wherein Mr.  Hyder  agreed to sell to our company a 50.829 acre (20.57  hectare)
claim located in the Cherryville area of British Columbia.  As consideration for
the purchase of the property,  we issued 250,000 shares of our company's  common
stock to Mr. Hyder.  In addition to the acquired  claim,  our company  staked or
acquired another 13 claims at various times over the subsequent months, to bring
the total area held under tenure to approximately 19,816 acres (8,020 hectares).
The flake graphite  mineralization  of interest here is hosted  predominately in
graphitic quartz/biotite, and lesser graphitic calc-silicate gneisses. The rocks
in the general  area of the BC Sugar  prospect  are similar to the host rocks in
the area of the crystal graphite deposit 55 miles (90 kms) to the southeast,  in
the vicinity of our company's Mount Heimdal block of claims.

The BC Sugar property is well placed in the Shushwap  Metamorphic  Complex, in a
geological  environment  favorable for the formation of flake graphite deposits,
and is in an area of excellent logistics, with a considerable network of logging
roads within the project area.  Additionally  the town of Lumby is approximately

                                       20
 
19 miles (30 kms) to the south of the property, while the City of Vernon is only
30 miles (50 kms) to the southwest of the western portions of the claim block.

We received  final  assays  from the October  2013  prospecting  and  geological
program at the BC Sugar  property in December of 2013.  That work  increased the
area  known  to  be  underlain  by  graphitic  bearing  gneisses,   and  further
evaluations were made in the area of the Sugar Lake, Weather Station, and Taylor
Creek  showings.  In the  general  vicinity of the Weather  Station  showing,  a
further 13 samples  were  taken,  and hand  trenching  was  performed  at one of
several  outcrops in the area.  In the trench a 5.2 meter  interval  returned an
average  of  3.14%  graphitic  carbon,  all in an  oxidized  relatively  friable
gneissic  host  rock.  Additionally  a  hydrothermal  or vein  type  mineralized
graphitic  quartz  boulder was  discovered  in the area which graded up to 4.19%
graphitic  carbon.  The source of this  boulder was not  discovered  during this
program,  but  it  is  felt  to  be  close  to  its  point  of  origin.  Samples
representative   of  the   mineralization   encountered   here  were  taken  for
petrographic  study,  which was received in late 2013. A brief  assessment  work
program was performed in September 2014 to ensure all claims in the package were
in good  standing  prior  to the  anticipated  sale of this  asset  to  Pathion.
Recommendations  were made by the consulting  geologist who wrote the assessment
report with respect to trenching,  and eventually  drilling the Weather  Station
showing.  Our company  submitted a Notice of Work to the BC  Government in early
May 2015 to enable our  company to  conduct a program  of  excavator  trenching,
sampling and geological  mapping on the Weather Station showing.  In May of 2015
we signed an agreement with KLM  Geosciences LLC of Las Vegas to conduct a short
Ground  Penetrating  Radar (GPR) survey on the property in the Weather Station -
Taylor  Creek  areas.  The GPR  survey as well as a GEM-2  electromagnetic  (EM)
survey took place in approximately  mid-May 2015. The GPR survey did not provide
useful data because of the moisture saturation in the shallow subsurface. The EM
survey  successfully  generated an anomaly over known  mineralization as well as
extended  the  anomaly  to the  west  under  an  area  of  cover  consisting  of
glacial/fluvial  till. Lithium Corporation is pleased with the results of the EM
survey and is considering  modifying our work plans to include  additional  work
that builds on the results of this survey.  In August of 2015 our Notice of Work
for  trenching  was  approved by the BC  Government  and in October we commenced
work. A trench was excavated and  graphitic  gneiss was mapped and sampled.  The
trench commenced in a friable biotitic quartz graphitic gneiss, and extended for
approximately  85  meters,   terminated  in  similar  material.   There  was  an
approximately 12 meter section of the trench that consisted of sand, and fluvial
till in a stream bed where the excavator could not reach the graphitic  material
that is  believed  to  possibly  exist at depths  greater  than 5 meters  due to
constant caving. Also there was a 4 meter section at depths from 4.8 to 5 meters
where graphite mineralization could be seen at depth, where sampling had to done
higher up in the trench after back filling due to safety reasons.

Trench sampling encountered 69 meters that averaged 1.997% graphitic carbon that
remains open to the north, and to the south. Within that interval there was a 30
meter section that averaged  2.73%  graphitic  carbon,  and within that interval
there was a 12 meter  section that averaged  2.99%  graphitic  carbon.  The best
mineralization,  and most  friable  material is proximal to an  abandoned  creek
channel,  and it appears  that  proximity  to this feature gave rise to the deep
weathering profile encountered here.

The Fall 2015 trenching  program  determined  that the zone of friable  graphite
mineralization  is quite consistent,  and extends further than anticipated,  and
that locally this weathering can extend to moderate depths.

THE HUGHES CLAIMS

Effective  April 23,  2014,  we entered  into an  operating  agreement  with All
American Resources,  L.L.C and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa,
LLC, a Nevada  limited  liability  company  incorporated  on December  12, 2013,
wherein we hold a 25%  membership  in a number of  patented  mining  claims that
spring  from the once vast  holdings of Howard  Hughes.  Our  company's  capital
contribution paid to Summa, LLC was $125,000,  of which $100,000 was in cash and
the balance in services.

Our company  participated  in the  formation of Summa,  which holds 88 fee-title
patented lode claims,  which cover  approximately  1,191.3 acres of  prospective
mineral lands. Our company has recently signed a joint operating  agreement with
the other  participants  to govern the conduct of Summa,  and the development of
the lands.  Our  company's  director,  Tom  Lewis,  has been named as a managing
member of Summa.

The Hughes lands are situated in six discrete prospect areas in Nevada, the most
notable of which  being the  Tonopah  block in Nye County  where  Summa holds 56
claims that cover  approximately  770 acres in the heart of the historic  mining

                                       21
 
camp where over 1.8 million ounces of gold and 174 million ounces of silver were
produced  predominately in the early 1900's.  The Hughes claims include a number
of the  prolific  past  producers in Tonopah,  such as the  Belmont,  the Desert
Queen,  and the Midway mines.  In addition  there are also claims in the area of
the past  producing  Klondyke  East  mining  district,  which is to the south of
Tonopah,  and at the town of Belmont (not to be confused  with the Belmont claim
in Tonopah),  Nevada,  another notable silver producer from the 1800's, which is
roughly 40 miles to the northeast of Tonopah.

Research has been  conducted on the Hughes  properties,  focusing on the Tonopah
area where  reporting in the 1980's,  indicate  that over 2.175  million tons of
mine dumps and mill tailings exist at surface on Summa's properties that contain
in the order of 3.453  million  ounces of silver,  and 28,500 ounces of gold. In
addition to this easily extractable  surficial resource,  other reports indicate
that 300 - 500,000 tons of  mineralized  material is expected to remain at depth
in old workings on Summa's  properties,  which is believed to contain an average
20 ounces  silver and 0.02 ounces gold per ton.  Also several  partially  tested
exploration  targets  have been  identified  on Summa's  Tonopah  claims,  where
further work could  potentially  lead to a marked increase in known  underground
resources.

GENERATIVE PROGRAMS

In June 2016 our company  entered in to a generative  Agreement with Idaho North
Resources (OTC Pink:  IDAH) in which the two companies  proposed to identify and
acquire  prospective  lithium  exploration  properties  in a 50/50  partnership.
Subsequently the "Big Lithium" prospect was staked within that partnership.

Lithium Corporation has also independently staked additional lithium exploration
properties,  the Buena vista Property and the Salt Wells  Property.  The company
intends to sell,  option,  or joint  venture these  properties  and is currently
pursuing those agreements to the best of its' ability.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE  MONTHS  ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30,  2016  COMPARED TO THE THREE  MONTHS  ENDED
SEPTEMBER, 2015

We had a net loss of $207,561  for the three month period  ended  September  30,
2016,  which was $147,734  more than the net loss of $59,827 for the three month
period ended  September 30, 2015. The change in our results over the two periods
is primarily the result of a decrease in the fair value of marketable securities
held by the Company  combined  with  increases  in  consulting  fees offset by a
reduction in exploration expenses.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was  $167,048,  a decrease of $32,747  from the  $199,795  net cash outflow
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Cash used in investing  activities  during the nine months ended  September  30,
2016 was  $16,700,  which was a $11,700  increase  from the $5,000  cash used in

To date we have relied on proceeds from the sale of our shares and on loans from
our sole  officer in order to sustain  our basic,  minimum  operating  expenses;
however, we cannot guarantee that we will secure any further sales of our shares
or that our sole officer and director with provide us with any future loans.  We
estimate that the cost of maintaining basic corporate operations (which includes
the cost of satisfying our public reporting  obligations)  will be approximately
$2,000 per month. Due to our current cash position of approximately  $305,217 as
of September 30, 2016, we estimate that we have  sufficient  cash to sustain our
basic operations for the next twelve months.

We  are  not  aware  of  any  known  trends,  demands,  commitments,  events  or
uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our
liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.

FUTURE FINANCINGS

We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to
continue to fund our business  operations.  Issuances of additional  shares will
result in dilution to our existing  stockholders.  There is no assurance that we
will achieve any additional  sales of our equity  securities or arrange for debt
or other financing to fund our planned business activities.

We presently  do not have any  arrangements  for  additional  financing  for the
expansion of our  exploration  operations,  and no potential  lines of credit or
sources of financing are currently  available for the purpose of proceeding with
our plan of operations.

                                       24
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have no off-balance sheet  arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition,  revenues or expenses, results of operations,  liquidity, and capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting  principles related to accounting and reporting by
exploration  stage  companies.  An  exploration  stage  company  is one in which
planned  principal  operations  have not  commenced  or if its  operations  have
commenced, there has been no significant revenues there from.

ACCOUNTING BASIS

Our company  uses the accrual  basis of  accounting  and  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("GAAP"  accounting).  Our
company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash includes cash on account,  demand deposits, and short-term instruments with
maturities of three months or less.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Our company maintains its cash in bank deposit  accounts,  the balances of which
at times may exceed federally insured limits. Our company  continually  monitors
its banking  relationships  and  consequently  has not experienced any losses in
such accounts. Our company believes we are not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Our company has yet to realize  revenues from  operations.  Once our company has
commenced  operations,  we will  recognize  revenues  when  delivery of goods or
completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive  evidence of an
agreement,  acceptance has been approved by its  customers,  the fee is fixed or
determinable  based on the  completion  of  stated  terms  and  conditions,  and
collection of any related receivable is probable.

LOSS PER SHARE

Basic  loss  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  loss  available  to  common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares  outstanding during
the year. The computation of diluted  earnings per share assumes the conversion,
exercise  or  contingent  issuance  of  securities  only when  such  conversion,
exercise or issuance  would have a dilutive  effect on earnings  per share.  The
dilutive effect of convertible  securities is reflected in diluted  earnings per
share by  application of the "if  converted"  method.  In the periods in which a
loss is incurred,  the effect of potential issuances of shares under options and
warrants  would be  anti-dilutive,  and therefore  basic and diluted  losses per
share are the same.

                                       25
 
INCOME TAXES

The  asset  and  liability  approach  is used to  account  for  income  taxes by
recognizing  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  for the  expected  future tax
consequences of temporary  differences  between the carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our company's financial instruments consist of cash, deposits, prepaid expenses,
and accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities.  Unless  otherwise  noted, it is
management's  opinion that our company is not exposed to  significant  interest,
currency or credit risks arising from these  financial  instruments.  Because of
the short  maturity  and  capacity  of prompt  liquidation  of such  assets  and
liabilities,  the fair value of these financial  instruments  approximate  their
carrying values, unless otherwise noted.

MINERAL PROPERTIES

Costs of exploration,  carrying and retaining  unproven mineral lease properties
are expensed as incurred.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs are capitalized
including  licenses and lease payments.  Although our company has taken steps to
verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures
do not guarantee our company's  title.  Such  properties may be subject to prior
agreements  or  transfers  and  title may be  affected  by  undetected  defects.
Impairment  losses are recorded on mineral  properties  used in operations  when
indicators of impairment are present and the  undiscounted  cash flows estimated
to be  generated  by those  assets are less than the  assets'  carrying  amount.
Impairment of $nil and $nil was recorded  during the periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In January 2016,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB"),  issued
Accounting  Standards  Update ("ASU")  2016-01,  "Financial  Instruments-Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,"  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally  accepted  accounting
principles  on the  classification  and  measurement  of financial  instruments.
Changes to the  current  guidance  primarily  affect the  accounting  for equity
investments,  financial  liabilities  under  the  fair  value  option,  and  the
presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition,
the ASU clarifies  guidance related to the valuation  allowance  assessment when
recognizing   deferred  tax  assets   resulting   from   unrealized   losses  on
available-for-sale  debt  securities.  The new standard is effective  for fiscal
years and interim  periods  beginning  after  December 15,  2017,  and are to be
adopted by means of a  cumulative-effect  adjustment to the balance sheet at the
beginning  of the first  reporting  period in which the  guidance is  effective.
Early  adoption is not  permitted  except for the provision to record fair value
changes for financial  liabilities  under the fair value option  resulting  from
instrument-specific  credit risk in other  comprehensive  income. Our company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

In November  2015,  the FASB issued ASU  2015-17,  "Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):
Balance  Sheet   Classification   of  Deferred   Taxes,"  which  simplifies  the
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified  as  noncurrent in a classified  statement of financial
position.  This ASU is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for annual
periods  beginning  after  December 16, 2016,  and interim  periods within those
annual  periods.  The adoption of this  standard will not have any impact on our
company's financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

area party or to which any of our properties is subject,  which would reasonably
be likely to have a material adverse effect on us, except for the following:

In December,  2015 two cases were filed against our company; the first was filed
in  the  United  States  District   Court,   District  of  Nevada  by  Jablonski
Enterprises, Ltd. against several defendants, including our company, Summa, LLC,
Henry  Tonking,  GIS Land Services,  Greg Ekins,  the Nye County  Assessor,  the
Mapping  Administrator for Nye County,  the Nye County District Attorney and the
Nye County  Deputy  District  Attorney  with respect to Summa,  LLC's efforts to
change the record name on the assessor's tax roles from Jablonski Enterprises to
Summa,  LLC pursuant to a prior court order issued by the Clark County  District
Court. The second identical case was filed in the 5th Judicial District Court of
Nevada against the same defendants,  including our company, and is regarding the
same issues.

On May 3,  2016,  the case in the 5th  Judicial  District  Court of  Nevada  was
dismissed against the appearing defendants with prejudice, and those defendants,
including  our  company,  were  awarded  legal  fees and costs to be paid by the
plaintiff  and the case is  currently  pending  an order  from  the  Court.  The
plaintiff  has filed an appeal to the  Supreme  Court of Nevada and at this time
the appeal to the Supreme Court is pending. The Federal case filed in the United
States  District  Court,  District  of Nevada is  currently  pending a motion to
dismiss  and we expect a similar  outcome as the State case in the 5th  Judicial
District Court of Nevada.  Our company  believes that the remaining case in U.S.
Federal Court is baseless, without merit and is purely a nuisance lawsuit.

I, Brian Goss, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Lithium Corporation;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))  and internal  control over
     financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and
     15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;
     (b)  Designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under
          our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;
     (c)  Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
     (d)  Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's  fourth fiscal quarter in
          the case of an annual  report)  that has  materially  affected,  or is
          reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
