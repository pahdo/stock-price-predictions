NOTE A General   

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Magellan Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Magellan ), include Magellan and its subsidiaries (together with Magellan, the  Company ). The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the  SEC ) instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes thereto, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 

Business Overview 

The Company is engaged in the healthcare management business, and is focused on managing the fastest growing, most complex areas of health, including special populations, complete pharmacy benefits and other specialty areas of healthcare. The Company develops innovative solutions that combine advanced analytics, agile technology and clinical excellence to drive better decision making, positively impact health outcomes and optimize the cost of care for the members we serve. The Company provides services to health plans and other managed care organizations ( MCOs ), employers, labor unions, various military and governmental agencies and third party administrators ( TPAs ). 

Healthcare 

Healthcare includes the Company s: (i) management of behavioral healthcare services and employee assistance program ( EAP ) services, (ii) management of other specialty areas including diagnostic imaging and musculoskeletal management, and (iii) the integrated management of physical, behavioral and pharmaceutical healthcare for special populations, delivered through Magellan Complete Care ( MCC ). These special populations include individuals with serious mental illness ( SMI ), dual eligibles, long term services and supports and other populations with unique and often complex healthcare needs. 

The Company s coordination and management of these healthcare services are provided through its comprehensive network of medical and behavioral health professionals, clinics, hospitals and ancillary service providers. This network of credentialed and privileged providers is integrated with clinical and quality improvement programs to improve access to care and enhance the healthcare experience for individuals in need of care, while at the same time making the cost of these services more affordable for our customers. The Company generally does not directly provide or own any provider of treatment services, although it does employ licensed behavioral health counselors to deliver non medical counseling under certain government contracts. 

The Healthcare segment s commercial division serves a variety of customers, with services, inclusive of special population management, provided under contracts with health plans and accountable care organizations for some or all of their commercial, Medicaid and Medicare members, as well as with employers. The government division contracts with local, state and federal governmental agencies to provide services to recipients under Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs.

The Company provides its management services primarily through: (i) risk based products, where the Company assumes all or a substantial portion of the responsibility for the cost of providing treatment services in exchange for a fixed per member per month fee and (ii) administrative services only ( ASO ) products, where the Company provides services such as utilization review, claims administration and/or provider network management, but does not assume responsibility for the cost of the treatment services. 

Pharmacy Management 

The Pharmacy Management segment ( Pharmacy Management ) comprises products and solutions that provide clinical and financial management of pharmaceuticals paid under medical and pharmacy benefit programs. Pharmacy Management s services include: (i) pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) services; (ii) pharmacy benefit administration ( PBA ) for state Medicaid and other government sponsored programs; (iii) pharmaceutical dispensing operations; (iv) clinical and formulary management programs; (v) medical pharmacy management programs; and (vi) programs for the integrated management of specialty drugs across both the medical and pharmacy benefit that treat complex conditions, regardless of site of service, method of delivery, or benefit reimbursement. 

Pharmacy Management s services are provided under contracts with health plans, employers, MCOs, state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part D and other government agencies, and encompass risk based and fee for service ( FFS ) arrangements. In addition, Pharmacy Management has subcontract arrangements to provide PBM services for certain Healthcare customers. 

Corporate 

This segment of the Company is comprised primarily of amounts not allocated to the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments that are largely associated with costs related to being a publicly traded company. In order to better represent the operations of the Company s segments, effective January 1, 2016, the Company began allocating operational and corporate support costs to the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments. These costs, which were historically reported in the Corporate segment, include operational support functions such as sales and marketing and information technology, as well as corporate support functions such as executive, finance and human resources. Prior period balances have been reclassified to reflect this change.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, medical claims payable, other medical liabilities, contingent consideration, stock compensation assumptions, tax contingencies and legal liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Managed Care and Other Revenue 

Managed Care Revenue.    Managed care revenue, inclusive of revenue from the Company s risk, EAP and ASO contracts, is recognized over the applicable coverage period on a per member basis for covered members. The Company is paid a per member fee for all enrolled members, and this fee is recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. The Company adjusts its revenue for retroactive membership terminations, additions and other changes, when such adjustments are identified, with the exception of retroactivity that can be reasonably estimated. The impact of retroactive rate amendments is generally recorded in the accounting period in which terms to the amendment are finalized, and that the amendment is executed. Any fees paid prior to the month of service are recorded as deferred revenue. Managed care revenues approximated $689.5 million and $2,004.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively and $576.8 million and $1,692.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Fee For Service, Fixed Fee and Cost Plus Contracts.    The Company has certain contracts with customers under which the Company recognizes revenue as services are performed and as costs are incurred. This includes revenues received in relation to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health insurer fee ( HIF fee ) billed on a cost reimbursement basis. Revenues from these contracts approximated $85.1 million and $248.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $143.7 million and $349.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Rebate Revenue.    The Company administers a rebate program for certain clients through which the Company coordinates the achievement, calculation and collection of rebates and administrative fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of clients. Each period, the Company estimates the total rebates earned based on actual volumes of pharmaceutical purchases by the Company s clients, as well as historical and/or anticipated sharing percentages. The Company earns fees based upon the volume of rebates generated for its clients. The Company does not record as rebate revenue any rebates that are passed through to its clients. Total rebate revenues approximated $23.5 million and

$56.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $22.0 million and $63.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

In relation to the Company s PBM business, the Company administers rebate programs through which it receives rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers that are shared with its customers. The Company recognizes rebates when the Company is entitled to them and when the amounts of the rebates are determinable. The amount recorded for rebates earned by the Company from the pharmaceutical manufacturers is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. 

PBM and Dispensing Revenue 

Pharmacy Benefit Management Revenue.    The Company recognizes PBM revenue, which consists of a negotiated prescription price (ingredient cost plus dispensing fee), co payments collected by the pharmacy and any associated administrative fees, when claims are adjudicated. The Company recognizes PBM revenue on a gross basis (i.e. including drug costs and co payments) as it is acting as the principal in the arrangement and is contractually obligated to its clients and network pharmacies, which is a primary indicator of gross reporting. In addition, the Company is solely responsible for the claims adjudication process, negotiating the prescription price for the pharmacy, collection of payments from the client for drugs dispensed by the pharmacy, and managing the total prescription drug relationship with the client s members. If the Company enters into a contract where it is only an administrator, and does not assume any of the risks previously noted, revenue will be recognized on a net basis. PBM revenues approximated $327.1 million and $842.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $413.7 million and $1,110.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Dispensing Revenue.    The Company recognizes dispensing revenue, which includes the co payments received from members of the health plans the Company serves, when the specialty pharmaceutical drugs are shipped. At the time of shipment, the earnings process is complete; the obligation of the Company s customer to pay for the specialty pharmaceutical drugs is fixed, and, due to the nature of the product, the member may neither return the specialty pharmaceutical drugs nor receive a refund. Revenues from the dispensing of specialty pharmaceutical drugs on behalf of health plans were $53.7 million and $151.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $57.5 million and $167.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Medicare Part D.      The Company is contracted with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) as a Prescription Drug Plan ( PDP ) to provide prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. Net revenues include insurance premiums earned by the PDP, which includes a direct premium paid by CMS and a beneficiary premium paid by the PDP member. In cases of low-income members, the beneficiary premium may be subsidized by CMS. The Company recognizes insurance premium revenues on a monthly basis on a per member basis for covered members. In addition to these premiums, net revenues includes certain payments from the members based on the members  actual prescription claims, including co-payments, coverage gap benefits, deductibles and co-insurance (collectively,  Member Responsibilities ). The Company receives a prospective subsidy payment from CMS each month to subsidize a portion of the Member Responsibilities for low-income members. If the prospective subsidy differs from actual prescription claims, the difference is recorded as either a receivable or payable on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assumes no risk for the Member Responsibilities, including the portion subsidized by CMS. The Company recognizes revenues for Member Responsibilities, including the portion subsidized by CMS, on a gross basis as claims are adjudicated. The CMS also provides an annual risk corridor adjustment which compares the Company s actual drug costs incurred to the premiums received. Based on the risk corridor adjustment, the Company may receive additional premiums from CMS or may be required to refund CMS a portion of previously received premiums. The Company calculates the risk corridor adjustment on a quarterly basis and the amount is included in net revenues with a corresponding receivable or payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Medicare Part D revenues approximated $76.5 million and $192.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, including co-payments, which are included in PBM revenues above, of $7.2 million and $24.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

Customers exceeding ten percent of segment net revenues 

In addition to the Florida Contracts and the Iowa Contracts previously discussed, the following customers generated in excess of ten percent of net revenues for the respective segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 (in thousands): 

(1) 

A vast majority of this customer s revenues were generated from drug acquisition costs related to PBM services which terminated on September 1, 2016.  The Company continues to provide specialty drug formulary management services to the customer and is in negotiations with the customer to extend this contract.      

Concentration of Business 

The Company also has a significant concentration of business with various counties in the State of Pennsylvania (the  Pennsylvania Counties ) which are part of the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, and with members under its contract with CMS. Net revenues from the Pennsylvania Counties in the aggregate totaled $294.9 million and $343.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Net revenues from members in relation to its contract with CMS in aggregate totaled $192.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company s contracts with customers typically have terms of one to three years, and in certain cases contain renewal provisions (at the customer s option) for successive terms of between one and two years (unless terminated earlier). Substantially all of these contracts may be immediately terminated with cause and many of the Company s contracts are terminable without cause by the customer or the Company either upon the giving of requisite notice and the

passage of a specified period of time (typically between 60 and 180 days) or upon the occurrence of other specified events. In addition, the Company s contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies generally are conditioned on legislative appropriations. These contracts generally can be terminated or modified by the customer if such appropriations are not made. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company has certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These assets and liabilities are to be measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, which are as follows: 

Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including the Company s data. 

In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has not transferred any assets between fair value measurement levels. 

The carrying values of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and revolving loan borrowings, approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The estimated fair value of the Company s term loans of $425.0 million as of September 30, 2016 was based on current interest rates for similar types of borrowings and is in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could be realized as of the balance sheet date or that will be realized in the future. 

All of the Company s investments are classified as  available-for-sale  and are carried at fair value. 

The contingent consideration liability reflects the fair value of potential future payments related to the CDMI, LLC ( CDMI ), Cobalt Therapeutics, LLC ( Cobalt ), 4D Pharmacy Management Systems, Inc. ( 4D ), The Management Group, LLC ( TMG ) and Armed Forces Services Corporation ( AFSC ) acquisitions. The CDMI purchase agreement provides for potential contingent payments up to a maximum aggregate amount of $165.0 million. The potential future payments are contingent upon CDMI meeting certain client retention, client conversion and gross profit milestones through December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there are remaining potential future payments of $65.0 million based on client conversion.  Based on the Company s current projections, these potential payments will not be earned and no reserve has been established. The 4D purchase agreement provided for potential contingent payments up to a maximum aggregate amount of $30.0 million. The potential future payments were contingent upon the achievement of certain growth targets in the underlying dual eligible membership served by 4D during calendar year 2015 and the retention of certain business.  The 4D contingent payments were finalized in 2016 and no future potential payments remain outstanding. The Cobalt, TMG and AFSC purchase agreements also provide for potential contingent payments of up to a maximum of $6.0 million, $15.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016,

there are remaining potential future payments of $5.0 million, $15.0 million and $10.0 million for Cobalt, TMG and AFSC, respectively.  

As of the balance sheet date, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on probabilities of payment, projected payment dates, discount rates, projected revenues, gross profits, client base, member engagement and new contract execution. The projected revenues, gross profits, client base, member engagement and new contract execution are derived from the Company s latest internal operational forecasts. The Company used a probability weighted discounted cash flow method to arrive at the fair value of the contingent consideration. Changes in the operational forecasts, probabilities of payment, discount rates or projected payment dates may result in a change in the fair value measurement. Any changes in the fair value measurement are reflected as income or expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss). As the fair value measurement for the contingent consideration is based on inputs not observed in the market, these measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by fair value measurement guidance. 

For CDMI, the Company estimated undiscounted future contingent payments of $90.1 million as of December 31, 2015, which the Company settled in June 2016. For 4D, the Company estimated net undiscounted future contingent payments of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2015, which the Company settled in February 2016. For Cobalt, TMG and AFSC the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include the discount rate, probabilities of payment and projected payment dates. For Cobalt, the Company estimated undiscounted future contingent payments of $1.7 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the short-term contingent consideration for Cobalt was $0.9 million. For TMG and AFSC, the Company estimated undiscounted future contingent payments of $3.8 million and $9.0 million at the acquisition date, respectively, and $3.8 million and $9.0 million as of September 30, 2016, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the long-term contingent consideration for TMG and Cobalt was $2.5 million and $8.4 million   

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the short-term and long-term contingent consideration was $91.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and is included in short-term contingent consideration and long-term contingent consideration, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the short-term and long-term contingent consideration was $0.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively, and is included in short-term contingent consideration and long-term contingent consideration, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration was $29.7 million and $47.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which were recorded as direct service costs and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The increases were mainly a result of changes in present value and the estimated undiscounted liability. 

The following table summarizes the Company s liability for contingent consideration for the nine months ended (in thousands):

excess capital and undistributed earnings for the Company s regulated subsidiaries of $112.1 million are included in cash and cash equivalents. 

Investments 

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the debt security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded to other than temporary impairment losses recognized in income in the consolidated statements of income (loss). For impaired debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such securities, but the Company expects that it will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the other  than temporary impairment is recognized in other than temporary impairment losses recognized in income in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the non credit component of the other than temporary impairment is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, there were no unrealized losses that the Company determined to be other than temporary. No realized gains or losses were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 or 2016. The following is a summary of short term and long term investments at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

The maturity dates of the Company s investments as of September 30, 2016 are summarized below (in thousands): 

Income Taxes 

The Company s effective income tax rates were 43.5 percent and 51.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. These rates differ from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes, permanent differences between book and tax income, and changes to recorded tax contingencies and valuation allowances. The Company also accrues interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its provision for income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is higher than the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly due to valuation allowance increases in 2016 with respect to losses at AlphaCare of New York, Inc. ( AlphaCare ). 

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with most of its eighty-percent or more controlled subsidiaries. The Company files a separate consolidated federal income tax return for AlphaCare and its parent, AlphaCare Holdings, Inc. The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to federal income tax assessments for years ended prior to 2013 or, with few exceptions, to state or local income tax assessments for years ended prior to 2012. Further, the statutes of limitation regarding the assessment of 2012 federal and certain state and local income taxes expired during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 ( Current Year Quarter ). As a result, $1.6 million of tax contingency reserves recorded as of December 31, 2015 were reversed in the Current Year Quarter, of which $1.1 million is reflected as a discrete reduction to income tax expense and $0.5 million as a decrease to deferred tax assets. Additionally, $0.1 million of accrued interest was reversed in the Current Year Quarter and reflected as a reduction to income tax expense due to the closing of statutes of limitation on tax assessments. 

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 

The Company has $2.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) available to reduce its federal consolidated taxable income in 2016 and subsequent years. These NOLs will expire in 2018 and 2019 if not used and are subject to examination and adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). AlphaCare has $36.2 million of federal NOLs available to reduce its consolidated taxable income in 2016 and subsequent years. These NOLs will expire in 2033 through 2035 if not used and are subject to examination and adjustment by the IRS. The Company and its subsidiaries also have $136.4 million of state NOLs available to reduce state taxable income at certain subsidiaries in 2016 and subsequent years. Most of these state NOLs will expire in 2017 through 2035 if not used and are subject to examination and adjustment by the respective state tax authorities. 

Deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 are shown net of valuation allowances of $15.5 million and $19.7 million, respectively. These valuation allowances mostly relate to uncertainties regarding the eventual realization of the AlphaCare federal NOLs and certain state NOLs. Determination of the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable requires significant judgment and estimation regarding the forecasts of future taxable income which are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the underlying businesses. Although consideration is also given to potential tax planning strategies which might be available to improve the realization of deferred tax assets, none were identified which were both prudent and reasonable. Future changes in the estimated realizable portion of deferred tax assets could materially affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

Health Care Reform 

The Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the  Health Reform Law ), imposes a mandatory annual fee on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The Company has obtained rate adjustments from customers which the Company expects will cover the direct costs of these fees and the impact from non deductibility of such fees for federal and state income tax purposes. To the extent the Company has such a customer that does not renew, there may be some impact due to taxes paid where the timing and amount of recoupment of these additional costs is uncertain. In the event the Company is unable to obtain rate adjustments to cover the financial impact of the annual fee, the fee may have a   material impact on the Company. For 2015 and 2016, the HIF fees were $26.5 million and $26.5 million, respectively, which have been paid. Of these amounts, $6.7 million and $19.9 million was expensed in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $6.7 million and $19.9 million was expensed in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which was included in direct service costs and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The Company recorded revenues of $11.6 million and $34.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $11.  0   million and $32.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, associated with the accrual for the reimbursement of the economic impact of the HIF fees from its customers. 

Stock Compensation 

At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company had equity based employee incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 6 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company recorded stock compensation expense of $12.9 million and $40.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $9.2 million and $27.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Stock compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 has been reduced for forfeitures, estimated at between zero and four percent for both periods. 

The weighted average grant date fair value of all stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $15.07 as estimated using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model, which also assumed an expected volatility of 27.75 percent based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock price. 

The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, $3.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of benefits of such tax deductions related to stock compensation expense were realized and as such were reported as financing cash flows. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net change to additional paid in capital related to tax benefits (deficiencies) was $3.8 million, which includes $3.9 million of excess tax benefits offset by $(0.1) million of excess tax deficiencies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net change to additional paid in capital related to tax benefits (deficiencies) was $0.3 million, which includes $0.5 million of excess tax benefits offset by $(0.2) million of excess tax deficiencies.

Summarized information related to the Company s nonvested restricted performance stock units ( PSUs ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The weighted average estimated fair value of the PSUs granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $97.22, which was derived from a Monte Carlo simulation. Significant assumptions utilized in estimating the value of the awards granted include an expected dividend yield of 0%, a risk free rate of 1%, and expected volatility of 16% to 81% (average of 32%). The PSUs granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, will entitle the grantee to receive a number of shares of the Company s common stock determined over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2018 and vesting on March 3, 2019, the settlement date, provided the grantee remains in the service of the Company on the settlement date. The Company expenses the cost of these awards ratably over the requisite service period. The number of shares for which the PSUs will be settled will be a percentage of shares for which the award is targeted and will depend on the Company s total shareholder return (as defined below), expressed as a percentile ranking of the Company s total shareholder return as compared to the Company s peer group (as defined below). The number of shares for which the PSUs will be settled vary from zero to 200 percent of the shares specified in the grant. Total shareholder return is determined by dividing the average share value of the Company s common stock over the 30 trading days preceding January 1, 2019 by the average share value of the Company s common stock over the 30 trading days beginning on January 1, 2016, with a deemed reinvestment of any dividends declared during the performance period. The Company s peer group includes 56 companies which comprise the S P Health Care Services Industry Index, which was selected by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors and includes a range of healthcare companies operating in several business segments. 

Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations 

On July 23, 2014, the Company entered into a $500.0 million Credit Agreement with various lenders that provides for Magellan Rx Management, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan Health, Inc.) to borrow up to $250.0 million of revolving loans, with a sublimit of up to $70.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company, and a term loan in an original aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the  2014 Credit Facility ). On December 2, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2014 Credit Facility under which Magellan Pharmacy Services, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan Health, Inc.) became a party to the $500.0 million Credit Agreement as the borrower and assumed all of the obligations of Magellan Rx Management, Inc. The 2014 Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the non-regulated subsidiaries of the Company and will mature on July 23, 2019; however, the Company holds an option to extend the 2014 Credit Facility for an additional one year period.  

Under the 2014 Credit Facility, the annual interest rate on revolving and term loan borrowings is equal to (i) in the case of base rate loans, the sum of a borrowing margin ranging from 0.50 percent to 1.00 percent plus the higher of the prime rate, one-half of one percent in excess of the overnight  federal funds  rate, or the Eurodollar rate for one month plus 1.00 percent, or (ii) in the case of Eurodollar rate loans, the sum of a borrowing margin ranging from 1.50 percent to 2.00 percent plus the Eurodollar rate for the selected interest period. The Company has the option to borrow in base rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans at its discretion, with the borrowing margin for these loans adjusted from time to time based on the Company s total leverage ratio. Letters of credit issued bear interest equal to the borrowing margin for

Eurodollar loans that ranges from 1.50 percent to 2.00 percent, with the commitment commission on the unused revolving loan commitment ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.35 percent. These letter of credit and commitment commission rates are adjusted from time to time based on the Company s total leverage ratio. 

Under the 2014 Credit Facility, on September 30, 2014, the Company completed a draw-down of the $250.0 million term loan (the  2014 Term Loan ). The borrowings have been maintained as a Eurodollar loan. The 2014 Term Loan is subject to certain quarterly amortization payments.  As of September 30, 2016 the remaining balance on the 2014 Term Loan was $225.0 million. The 2014 Term Loan will mature on July 23, 2019. As of September 30, 2016, the 2014 Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 1.625 percent plus the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), which was equivalent to a total interest rate of approximately 2.149 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate was approximately 1.979 percent. 

On June 27, 2016, the Company entered into a $200.0 million Credit Agreement with various lenders that provides for a $200.0 million term loan (the  2016 Term Loan ) to Magellan Pharmacy Services, Inc. (the  2016 Credit Facility ). The 2016 Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the non-regulated subsidiaries of the Company and will mature on December 29, 2017. 

Under the 2016 Credit Facility, the annual interest rate on the term loan is equal to (i) in the case of base rate loans, the sum of a borrowing margin ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.75 percent plus the higher of the prime rate, one-half of one percent in excess of the overnight  federal funds  rate, or the Eurodollar rate for one month plus 1.00 percent, or (ii) in the case of Eurodollar rate loans, the sum of a borrowing margin ranging from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent plus the Eurodollar rate for the selected interest period. The Company has the option to borrow in base rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans at its discretion, with the borrowing margin for these loans adjusted from time to time based on the Company s total leverage ratio.  

The borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan have been maintained as a Eurodollar loan. As of September 30, 2016 the remaining balance on the 2016 Term Loan was $200.0 million and bore interest at a rate of approximately 1.375 percent plus the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), which was equivalent to a total interest rate of approximately 1.899 percent. During the period the term loan was outstanding, from June 27, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate was approximately 1.866 percent. 

As of September 30, 2016, the contractual maturities of the term loans under the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2016 Credit Facility were as follows: 2016 $6.3 million; 2017 $225.0 million; 2018 $25.0 million; and 2019 $168.7 million. The Company had $33.4 million and $33.7 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company had no revolving loan borrowings at December 31, 2015. Beginning in April 2016, due to the timing of working capital needs, the Company has borrowed from the revolving loan under the 2014 Credit Facility. The revolving loan borrowings have been in the form of Eurodollar rate loans and totaled $90.0 million at September 30, 2016. As of November 7, 2016, the Company has revolving loans totaling $65.0 million, resulting in $151.3 million of revolving loans available under the 2014 Credit Facility.  

There were $24.4 million and $24.4 million of capital lease obligations at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. Included in long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 are deferred loan issuance costs of $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  

Goodwill 

The Company is required to test its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.

Intangible Assets 

The Company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur which may potentially impact the estimated useful life of the intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recognized $4.8 million in impairment charges, which are reflected in direct service costs and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and reported within the Healthcare segment. The fair value of the impairment was determined using the income method, which resulted in the full impairment of the customer agreement intangible asset recorded in conjunction with the AlphaCare acquisition.

Amortization expense was $8.1 million and $21.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and $7.8 million and $22.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company estimates amortization expense will be $30.0 million, $26.8 million, $23.8 million, $23.2 million and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 

Redeemable Non Controlling Interest 

As of September 2016, the Company held an equity interest of approximately 84% in AlphaCare Holdings. The other shareholders of AlphaCare Holdings have the right to exercise put options, requiring the Company to purchase up to 50% of the remaining shares prior to January 1, 2017, provided certain membership levels are attained. After December 31, 2016, the other shareholders of AlphaCare Holdings have the right to exercise put options requiring the Company to purchase all or any portion of the remaining shares. In addition, after December 31, 2016, the Company has the right to purchase all remaining shares. Non controlling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within the Company s control are considered redeemable non controlling interests. Redeemable non controlling interest is considered to be temporary and is therefore reported in a mezzanine level between liabilities and stockholders  equity on the Company s consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the non controlling interest s share of net income or loss or its redemption value. The carrying value of the non controlling interest as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 was $5.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The $1.7 million decrease in carrying value is a result of operating losses, partially offset by the impact of additional capital provided by the Company. The Company evaluates the redemption value on a quarterly basis. If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, the Company adjusts the carrying amount of the non controlling interest to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Under this method, this is viewed at the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the non controlling interest. The Company will reflect redemption value adjustments in the earnings per share ( EPS ) calculation if redemption value is in excess of the carrying value of the non controlling interest. As of September 30, 2016, the carrying value of the non controlling interest exceeded the redemption value and therefore no adjustment to the carrying value was required. 

Reclassifications 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 

In order to better represent the operations of the Company s segments, effective January 1, 2016, the Company began allocating operational and corporate support costs to the Healthcare and Pharmacy Management segments. For comparative presentation, the Company applied the allocation methodology retrospectively and reclassified direct service costs and other between segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The impact of these reclassifications are disclosed in Note C  Business Segment Information .

NOTE B Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Magellan Health, Inc. 

The following table reconciles income attributable to common shareholders (numerator) and shares (denominator) used in the computations of net income per share attributable to common shareholders (in thousands, except per share data): 

The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were calculated using outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. Common stock equivalents included in the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 represent stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, RSAs, RSUs, PSUs and stock purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

The Company had additional potential dilutive securities outstanding representing 1.4 million and 1.1 million options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and 1.8 million and 1.2 million options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, that were not included in the computation of dilutive securities because they were anti-dilutive for the period. Had these shares not been anti-dilutive, all of these shares would not have been included in the net income attributable to common shareholder per common share calculation as the Company uses the treasury stock method of calculating diluted shares. 

NOTE C Business Segment Information 

The accounting policies of the Company s segments are the same as those described in Note A  General.  The Company evaluates performance of its segments based on profit or loss from operations before stock compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest and other income, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration recorded in relation to acquisitions, gain on sale of assets, special charges or benefits, and income taxes ( Segment Profit ). Management uses Segment Profit information for internal reporting and control purposes and considers it important in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital and other resources, risk assessment and employee compensation, among other matters. Healthcare subcontracts with Pharmacy Management to provide pharmacy benefits management services for certain of Healthcare s customers. In addition, Pharmacy Management provides pharmacy benefits management for the Company s employees covered under its medical plan. As such, revenue, cost of goods sold and direct service costs and other related to these arrangements are eliminated. The Company s segments are defined in Note A  General .

NOTE D Commitments and Contingencies 

Legal 

The Company s operating activities entail significant risks of liability. From time to time, the Company is subject to various actions and claims arising from the acts or omissions of its employees, network providers or other parties. In the normal course of business, the Company receives reports relating to deaths and other serious incidents involving patients whose care is being managed by the Company. Such incidents occasionally give rise to malpractice, professional negligence and other related actions and claims against the Company or its network providers. Many of these actions and claims received by the Company seek substantial damages and therefore require the Company to incur significant fees and costs related to their defense. 

The Company is also subject to or party to certain class actions and other litigation and claims relating to its operations or business practices. In the opinion of management, the Company has recorded reserves that are adequate to cover litigation, claims or assessments that have been or may be asserted against the Company, and for which the outcome is probable and reasonably estimable. Management believes that the resolution of such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. 

Stock Repurchases 

On October 22, 2014 the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan which authorized the Company to purchase up to $200 million of its outstanding common stock through October 22, 2016 (the  2014 Repurchase Program ). On October 26, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan which authorized the Company to purchase up to $200 million of its outstanding common stock through October 26, 2017 (the  2015 Repurchase Program ). Stock repurchases under the programs may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions (including blocks) or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of the Company s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other corporate considerations. Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow the Company to purchase its shares during periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Repurchases are expected to be funded from working capital and anticipated cash from operations. The repurchase authorization does not require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by the Company s board of directors at any time.

NOTE E Acquisitions 

Acquisition of AFSC 

Pursuant to the May 15, 2016 share purchase agreement (the  AFSC Agreement ) with Armed Forces Services Corporation ( AFSC ), on July 1, 2016 the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of AFSC (the  AFSC Acquisition ). AFSC has extensive experience providing and managing behavioral health and specialty services to various agencies of the federal government, including all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.  

The base purchase price for the AFSC Acquisition per the AFSC Agreement was $117.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Pursuant to the AFSC Agreement, certain members of AFSC s management, who were also shareholders of AFSC, purchased a total of $4.0 million in Magellan restricted common stock, which will vest over a two-year period, conditioned upon continued employment with the Company. Consideration for the AFSC Acquisition includes a net payment for the net base purchase price of $113.5 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments, including adjustments for cash acquired. Proceeds from the sale of restricted common stock are recorded as stock compensation expense over the requisite service period. 

In addition to the base purchase price, the AFSC Agreement provides for potential contingent payments up to a maximum aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The potential contingent payments are based on the retention of certain core business by AFSC. 

The Company will report the results of operation of AFSC within the Healthcare segment. The consolidated statements of income (loss) include total revenues and Segment Profit for AFSC of $43.9 million and $7.2 million for the three months subsequent to the acquisition, respectively.

The purchase price has been allocated based upon the estimated fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. A portion of the excess purchase price over tangible net assets acquired has been allocated to identified intangible assets totaling $41.3 million, consisting of customer contracts in the amount of $38.1 million, which is being amortized over seven years, trade name in the amount of $3.0 million, which has an indefinite life, and non-compete agreements in the amount of $0.2 million, which is being amortized over four years. The acquisition resulted in $82.3 million in goodwill related primarily to anticipated synergies and the assembled workforce of AFSC.  None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.   

The Company s total consideration for this transaction, as of the date of acquisition, totaled $141.3 million, including an accrual for estimated contingent consideration of $8.2 million.  

The estimated fair value of AFSC assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

The Company s estimated fair values of AFSC assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition are determined based on certain valuations and analyses that have yet to be finalized, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as detailed above, are subject to adjustment once the analyses are completed. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period as required.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company established a working capital receivable of $2.2 million that was reflected as a reduction to goodwill.  

The fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on probabilities of payment, projected payment dates, discount rates and projected contract retention. The Company used a probability weighted discounted cash flow method to arrive at the fair value of contingent consideration. Changes in the probabilities of payment, discount rates or projected payment dates may result in a change in the fair value measurement. Any changes in the fair value measurement are reflected as income or expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss). As of the acquisition date, the Company estimated undiscounted future contingent consideration payments of $9.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration was $8.4 million and is included in long-term contingent consideration in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The change in the present value of the contingent consideration was $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and was recorded as direct service costs and other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Other Acquisitions 

Pursuant to the February 9, 2016 purchase agreement (the  TMG Agreement ) with TMG, on February 29, 2016 the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of TMG. TMG is a company with 30 years of expertise in community-based long-term care services and supports. As consideration for the transaction, the Company paid a base price of $14.8 million in cash, including net receipts of $0.2 million for working capital adjustments. In addition to the base purchase price, the TMG agreement provides for potential contingent payments up to a maximum aggregate of $15.0 million. The potential future payments are contingent upon the Company being awarded additional managed long-term services and supports contracts. The Company reports the results of operations of TMG within its Healthcare segment.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, medical claims payable, other medical liabilities, stock compensation assumptions, tax contingencies, legal liabilities and contingent consideration payable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Except as noted below, the Company s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 

Results of Operations 

The accounting policies of the Company s segments are the same as those described in Note A  General.  The Company evaluates performance of its segments based on Segment Profit. Management uses Segment Profit information for internal reporting and control purposes and considers it important in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital and other resources, risk assessment and employee compensation, among other matters. Healthcare subcontracts with Pharmacy Management to provide pharmacy benefits management services for certain of Healthcare s customers. In addition, Pharmacy Management provides pharmacy benefits management for the Company s employees covered under its medical plan. As such, revenue, cost of goods sold and direct service costs and other related to these arrangements are eliminated. The Company s segments are defined in Note A  General .

Non GAAP Measures 

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP, however the Company s management also assesses business performance and makes business decisions regarding the Company s operations using certain non GAAP measures. In addition to Segment Profit, as defined above, the Company also uses adjusted net income attributable to Magellan Health, Inc. ( Adjusted Net Income ) and adjusted net income per common share attributable to Magellan Health, Inc. on a diluted basis ( Adjusted EPS ). Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS reflect certain adjustments made for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2013 to exclude non cash stock compensation expense resulting from restricted stock purchases by sellers, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, amortization of identified acquisition intangibles, as well as impairment of identified acquisition intangibles. The Company believes these non GAAP measures provide a more useful comparison of the Company s underlying business performance from period to period and are more representative of the earnings capacity of the Company. Non GAAP financial measures we disclose, such as Segment Profit, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Healthcare 

Net Revenue 

Net revenue related to Healthcare decreased by 7.7 percent or $57.7 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter. The decrease in revenue is mainly due to terminated contracts of $175.0 million, unfavorable rate changes of $18.4 million, program changes of $16.6 million, revenue impact of unfavorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Prior Year Quarter of $3.9 million and other net unfavorable variances of 1.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased membership from existing customers of $78.0 million, revenue for AFSC acquired on July 1, 2016 of $43.9 million, contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Quarter of $19.8 million, revenue for TMG acquired February 29, 2016 of $12.5 million and the revenue impact of unfavorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Current Year Quarter of $3.4 million. 

Cost of Care 

Cost of care decreased by 19.5 percent or $116.1 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter. The decrease in cost of care is primarily due to terminated contracts of $152.0 million, lower care associated with unfavorable rate changes of $21.3 million, program changes of $13.9 million, net favorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Current Year Quarter of $9.6 million, unfavorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Prior Year Quarter of $8.6 million and care trends and other net favorable variances of $22.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased membership from existing customers of $68.5 million, care costs for AFSC acquired on July 1, 2016 of $28.1 million and new contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Quarter of $15.6 million. For our commercial contracts, cost of care decreased as a percentage of risk revenue (excluding EAP business) from 82.4 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 80.0 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to favorable care development in the Current Year Quarter. For our government contracts, cost of care decreased as a percentage of risk revenue (excluding EAP business) from 93.0 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 81.3 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to business mix. 

Direct Service Costs 

Direct service costs increased by 23.8 percent or $29.4 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter primarily due to costs related to TMG and AFSC, partially offset by the impact of terminated contracts, as well as severance and other contract termination cost of $2.3 million recorded in the Prior Year Quarter. Direct service costs increased as a percentage of revenue from 16.5 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 22.2 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to business mix changes related to terminated contracts and the acquisition of TMG and AFSC.

Pharmacy Management 

Managed Care and Other Revenue 

Managed care and other revenue related to Pharmacy Management increased by 0.2 percent or $0.1 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter. This increase is primarily due to government pharmacy revenue of $1.4 million and other net favorable variances of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreased rebate revenue of $1.6 million. 

PBM and Dispensing Revenue 

PBM and dispensing revenue related to Pharmacy Management increased by 39.3 percent or $160.9 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter. This increase is primarily due to new contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Quarter of $163.2 million, pharmacy employer revenue of $29.9 million and other net favorable variances of $1.3 million. These favorable variances were partially offset by terminated contracts of $28.4 million, net decreased dispensing activity from existing customers of $3.4 million and pharmacy MCO revenue of $1.7 million. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold increased by 38.7 percent or $150.3 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter. This increase is primarily due to new contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Quarter of $158.9 million and an increase in pharmacy employer of $24.9 million. These increases were partially offset by terminated contracts of $27.9 million, net decreased dispensing activity from existing customers of $3.2 million, and other net favorable variances of $2.4 million. As a percentage of the portion of net revenue that relates to PBM and dispensing activity, cost of goods sold decreased from 94.7 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 94.4 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to business mix. 

Direct Service Costs 

Direct service costs decreased by 27.7 percent or $25.4 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter mainly relates to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the CDMI and 4D acquisitions of $30.5 million in the Prior Year Period and lower stock compensation expense of $4.4 million, partially offset by contract implementation costs and ongoing costs to support new business. As a percentage of revenue, direct service costs decreased from 19.5 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 10.5 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to the increase in revenue from business growth and the decrease in expense for fair value of contingent consideration and stock compensation expense. 

Corporate and Elimination 

Net expenses related to Corporate, which includes eliminations, increased by 74.2 percent or $4.7 million, primarily due to higher project costs and discretionary benefits in the Current Year Quarter. As a percentage of revenue, corporate and elimination increased from 0.5 percent in the Prior Year Quarter to 0.8 percent in the Current Year Quarter, mainly due to higher project cost and discretionary benefits in the Current Year Quarter. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.6 percent or $0.2 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter, primarily due to asset additions after the Prior Year Quarter and acquisition activity, partially offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized after the Prior Year Quarter. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased by $1.4 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter primarily due to an increase in interest rates and the amount of outstanding debt.

Interest Income 

Interest income increased by $0.1 million from the Prior Year Quarter to the Current Year Quarter primarily due to higher yields. 

Income Taxes 

The Company s effective income tax rates were 48.3 percent and 42.4 percent for the Prior Year Quarter and Current Year Quarter, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the Current Year Quarter differs from the Prior Year Quarter mainly due to a less significant relative impact in the Current Year Quarter from the non-deductible HIF fees due to increased segment profit. 

The statutes of limitation regarding the assessment of 2012 federal and certain state and local income taxes expired during the Current Year Quarter. As a result, $1.6 million of tax contingency reserves recorded as of December 31, 2015 were reversed in the Current Year Quarter, of which $1.1 million is reflected as a discrete reduction to income tax expense, and $0.5 million as a decrease to deferred tax assets. Additionally, $0.1 million of accrued interest was reversed in the Current Year Quarter and reflected as a reduction to income tax expense due to the closing of statutes of limitation on tax assessments. 

The statutes of limitation regarding the assessment of 2011 federal and certain state and local income taxes expired during the Prior Year Quarter. As a result, $1.7 million of tax contingency reserves recorded as of December 31, 2014 were reversed in the Prior Year Quarter, of which $1.2 million was reflected as a discrete reduction to income tax expense and $0.5 million as a decrease to deferred tax assets. Additionally, $0.1 million of accrued interest was reversed in the Prior Year Quarter and reflected as a reduction to income tax expense due to the closing of statutes of limitation on tax assessments.

Healthcare 

Net Revenue 

Net revenue related to Healthcare decreased by 10.3 percent or $222.9 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period. The decrease in revenue is mainly due to terminated contracts of $507.2 million, unfavorable rate changes of $49.6 million, program changes of $25.4 million and other net unfavorable variances of $4.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased membership from existing customers of $226.9 million, contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Period of $53.6 million, revenue for AFSC acquired July 1, 2016 of $43.9 million, revenue for TMG acquired February 29, 2016 of $29.2 million, unfavorable retroactive rate adjustments in the Prior Year Period of $3.3 million, favorable retroactive rate adjustments in the Current Year Period of $3.3 million and the revenue impact of unfavorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Current Year Period of $3.4 million. 

Cost of Care 

Cost of care decreased by 16.4 percent or $276.5 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period. The decrease in cost of care is primarily due to terminated contracts of $442.8 million, lower care associated with unfavorable rate changes of $48.8 million, program changes of $20.5 million, favorable medical claims development for the Prior Year Period which was recorded after the Prior Year Period of $6.3 million, net favorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Current Year Period of $3.6 million and care trends and other net favorable variances of $27.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased membership from existing customers of $185.1 million, new contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Period of $36.5 million, care costs for AFSC acquired on July 1, 2016 of $28.1 million and favorable prior period medical claims development recorded in the Prior Year Period of $23.2 million. For our commercial contracts, cost of care as a percentage of risk revenue (excluding EAP business) was 82.7 percent in the Current Year Period which was consistent with the Prior Year Period. For our government contracts, cost of care decreased as a percentage of risk revenue (excluding EAP business) from

Direct Service Costs 

Direct service costs increased by 11.1 percent or $41.7 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period primarily due to the $4.8 million impairment of an intangible asset and costs related to TMG and AFSC, partially offset by the impact of terminated contracts, as well as severance and other contract termination cost of $2.3 million recorded in the Prior Year Period. Direct service costs increased as a percentage of revenue from 17.4 percent in the Prior Year Period to 21.5 percent in the Current Year Period, mainly due to the impairment of an intangible asset and costs related to TMG and AFSC, partially offset by terminated contracts. 

Pharmacy Management 

Managed Care and Other Revenue 

Managed care and other revenue related to Pharmacy Management increased by 10.3 percent or $16.8 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period. This increase is primarily due to increased rebate revenue of $6.8 million, government pharmacy revenue of $6.6 million, new contracts implemented after (or during) the Prior Year Period of $5.3 million and medical pharmacy revenue of $1.3 million. These increases were partially offset by other net unfavorable variances of $3.2 million. 

PBM and Dispensing Revenue 

PBM and dispensing revenue related to Pharmacy Management increased by 42.6 percent or $458.8 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period.

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold increased by 42.1 percent or $429.5 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period.

Direct Service Costs 

Direct service costs decreased by 13.5 percent or $29.8 million from the Prior Year Period to the Current Year Period. This decrease mainly relates to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the CDMI and 4D acquisitions of $47.9 million in the Prior Year Period and lower stock compensation expense of $13.2 million, which decreases were partially offset by additional costs from the acquisition of 4D, contract implementation costs and ongoing costs to support new business. As a percentage of revenue, direct service costs decreased from 17.8 percent in the Prior Year Period to 11.2 percent in the Current Year Period, mainly due to the decrease in expense for fair value of contingent consideration and stock compensation expense, partially offset by the increase in revenue from business growth and acquisition activity. 

Corporate and Elimination 

Net expenses related to Corporate, which includes eliminations, increased by 34.2 percent or $7.6 million, primarily due to higher project costs and increase in discretionary benefits in the Current Year Period.

Interest Income

Income Taxes 

The Company s effective income tax rates were 43.5 percent and 51.9 percent for the Prior Year Period and Current Year Period, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the Current Year Period differs from the Prior Year Period mainly due to valuation allowance increases in 2016 with respect to losses at AlphaCare. 

The statutes of limitation regarding the assessment of 2012 federal and certain state and local income taxes expired during the Current Year Period. As a result, $1.6 million of tax contingency reserves recorded as of December 31, 2015 were reversed in the Current Year Period, of which $1.1 million is reflected as a discrete reduction to income tax expense, and $0.5 million as a decrease to deferred tax assets.

Outlook Results of Operations 

The Company s Segment Profit and net income are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. These fluctuations may result from a variety of factors such as those set forth under Item 2  Forward Looking Statements  as well as a variety of other factors including: (i) changes in utilization levels by enrolled members of the Company s risk based and other pharmacy contracts, including seasonal utilization patterns; (ii) contractual adjustments and settlements; (iii) retrospective membership adjustments; (iv) timing of implementation of new contracts, enrollment changes and contract terminations; (v) pricing adjustments upon contract renewals (and price competition in general); (vi) the timing of acquisitions; (vii) changes in estimates regarding medical costs and IBNR; and (viii) changes in the estimates of contingent consideration. 

A portion of the Company s business is subject to rising care costs due to an increase in the number and frequency of covered members seeking healthcare services and higher costs of such services. Many of these factors are beyond the Company s control. Future results of operations will be heavily dependent on management s ability to obtain customer rate increases that are consistent with care cost increases and/or to reduce operating expenses. 

Care Trends.    The Company expects that same store normalized cost of care trend for the 12 month forward outlook to be 3 to 7 percent for commercial products and 0 to 2 percent for government business. 

Interest Rate Risk.    Changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on the Company s cash equivalents and investments, as well as interest expense on variable interest rate borrowings under the Company s 2014 Credit Facility and 2016 Credit Facility (collectively, the  Credit Facilities ). Based on the amount of cash equivalents and   

41 

Table of Contents  

investments and the borrowing levels under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2016, a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in the interest rate associated with these instruments, with all other variables held constant, would not materially affect the Company s future earnings and cash outflows. 

Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Operating Activities.    The Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $178.1 million and $70.9 million for the Prior Year Period and Current Year Period, respectively. The $107.2 million decrease in operating cash flows from the Prior Year Period is attributable to a net shift of restricted funds between cash and investments that results in an operating cash flow change that is directly offset by an investing cash flow change, unfavorable working capital changes, offset by an increase in Segment Profit between years.     

Restricted cash of $93.8 million in the Prior Year Period was shifted to restricted investments that increased operating cash flows. Restricted cash of $36.8 million in the Current Year Period was shifted from restricted investments that decreased operating cash flows. The net impact of the shift in restricted funds between periods is a decrease in operating cash flows of $130.6 million.   

The net unfavorable impact of working capital changes between periods totaled $3.3 million. For the Prior Year Period, operating cash flows were impacted by net unfavorable working capital changes of $47.4 million, which were largely attributable to timing of discretionary bonus activity and other unfavorable working capital changes due to the timing related to receivables and payables. For the Current Year Period, operating cash flows were impacted by net unfavorable working capital changes of $50.7 million, which were largely attributable to contingent consideration payments of $91.1 million, of which $51.1 million is reflected as operating activities, and working capital changes of approximately $70.0 million related to our Medicare Part D business, specifically receivables. These unfavorable working capital changes were partially offset by sources from restricted cash and other favorable working capital changes due to the timing related to receivables and payables. Segment Profit for Current Year Period increased $26.2 million from the Prior Year Period.   

During the Current Year Period, the Company had a restricted cash flow source of $79.0 million mainly due to the runoff of the Iowa contract. 

Investing Activities.    The Company utilized $54.6 million and $44.3 million during the Prior Year Period and Current Year Period, respectively, for capital expenditures. The additions related to hard assets (equipment, furniture and leaseholds) and capitalized software for the Prior Year Period were $19.1 million and $35.5 million, respectively, as compared to additions for the Current Year Period related to hard assets and capitalized software of $9.8 million and $34.5 million, respectively. 

During the Prior Year Period the Company used net cash of $108.2 million for the net purchase of  available for sale  securities, with the Company receiving net cash of $8.1 million during the Current Year Period from the net maturity of  available for sale  securities. In addition, during the Prior Year Period, the Company used net cash of $42.4 million and $13.6 million for the acquisitions of 4D and HSM Physical Health, respectively. During the Current Year Period, the Company used net cash of $111.4 million and $16.6 million for the acquisitions of AFSC and TMG, respectively, partially offset by a working capital adjustment of $0.5 million related to the acquisition of 4D. 

Financing Activities.    During the Prior Year Period, the Company paid $150.8 million for the repurchase of treasury stock under the Company s share repurchase program, $9.4 million on debt obligations and $3.3 million on capital lease obligations. The Company made a contingent consideration payment totaling $11.2 million of which $8.9 million was related to financing activities. In addition, the Company received $50.1 million from the exercise of stock options and had other net favorable items of $4.3 million. 

During the Current Year Period, the Company paid $106.8 million for the repurchase of treasury stock under the Company s share repurchase program, $9.4 million on debt obligations, and $4.2 million on capital lease obligations. The Company made contingent consideration payments totaling $91.7 million, of which $40.6 million was related to financing activities. In addition, the Company received $290.0 million from the issuance of debt, $10.9 million from the exercise of stock options, and had other net favorable items of $1.9 million.

Outlook Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity.    During the remainder of 2016, the Company will have estimated capital expenditures of between $14.7 million and $24.7 million. In addition, the Company anticipates working capital increases for full year 2016 of approximately $100 million, mainly for receivables from CMS and other parties related to our Part D business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the working capital increase related to Part D business was approximately $70.0 million. As of November 7, 2016, due to the timing of working capital needs, the Company borrowed a net total of $65.0 million of the $250.0 million of revolving loans available under the 2014 Credit Facility. The Company may have to draw on the 2014 Credit Facility to the extent that the anticipated timing of receivables, payables or share repurchases changes during the year. The Company currently expects to have adequate liquidity to satisfy its existing financial commitments over the periods in which they will become due. The Company plans to maintain its current investment strategy of investing in a diversified, high quality, liquid portfolio of investments and continues to closely monitor the situation in the financial markets. The Company estimates that it has no risk of any material permanent loss on its investment portfolio; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience any such losses in the future. 

Stock Repurchases.    On October 26, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan which authorized the Company to purchase up to $200 million of its outstanding common stock through October 26, 2017. See Note D    Commitments and Contingencies    for more information on the Company s share repurchase program. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements. 

Credit Facilities.    On July 23, 2014, the Company entered into a $500.0 million Credit Agreement with various lenders that provides for Magellan Rx Management, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan Health, Inc.) to borrow up to $250.0 million of revolving loans, with a sublimit of up to $70.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company, and a term loan in an original aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million. On December 2, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2014 Credit Facility under which Magellan Pharmacy Services, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan Health, Inc.) became a party to the $500.0 million Credit Agreement as the borrower and assumed all of the obligations of Magellan Rx Management, Inc. The 2014 Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the non regulated subsidiaries of the Company and will mature on July 23, 2019, however, the Company holds an option to extend the 2014 Credit Facility for an additional one year period. 

On June 27, 2016, the Company entered into a $200.0 million Credit Agreement with various lenders that provides for a $200.0 million term loan to Magellan Pharmacy Services, Inc. The 2016 Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the non regulated subsidiaries of the Company and will mature on December 29, 2017. 

See Note A  General  for more information on the Credit Facilities. 

Restrictive Covenants in Debt Agreements.    The Credit Facilities contain covenants that potentially limit management s discretion in operating the Company s business by, in certain circumstances, restricting or limiting the Company s ability, among other things, to: 

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred or redeemable stock;     

pay dividends and make other distributions;     

repurchase equity interests;     

make certain advances, investments and loans;     

enter into sale and leaseback transactions;     

create liens;     

sell and otherwise dispose of assets;     

43 

Table of Contents  

acquire or merge or consolidate with another company; and     

enter into some types of transactions with affiliates.     

These restrictions could adversely affect the Company s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in the Company s interest. 

The Credit Facilities also require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Failure to do so, unless waived by the lenders under the Credit Facilities pursuant to its terms, would result in an event of default under the Credit Facilities. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

Changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on the Company s cash equivalents and investments, as well as interest expense on variable interest rate borrowings under the Company s Credit Facilities. Based on the amount of cash equivalents and investments and the borrowing levels under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2016, a hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in the interest rate associated with these instruments, with all other variables held constant, would not materially affect the Company s future earnings and cash outflows. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

a) 
			 The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of   September   30, 2016. Based on their evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September   30, 2016.     

b) 
			 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, the Company has determined that there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s quarter ended   September   30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.   

The Company s operating activities entail significant risks of liability. From time to time, the Company is subject to various actions and claims arising from the acts or omissions of its employees, network providers or other parties. In the normal course of business, the Company receives reports relating to deaths and other serious incidents involving patients whose care is being managed by the Company. Such incidents occasionally give rise to malpractice, professional negligence and other related actions and claims against the Company or its network providers. Many of these actions and claims received by the Company seek substantial damages and therefore require the Company to incur significant fees and costs related to their defense. 

The Company is also subject to or party to certain class actions and other litigation and claims relating to its operations or business practices. In the opinion of management, the Company has recorded reserves that are adequate to cover litigation, claims or assessments that have been or may be asserted against the Company, and for which the outcome is probable and reasonably estimable. Management believes that the resolution of such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.   

There has been no material change in our risk factors as disclosed in Part I Item 1A  Risk Factors  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

The Company s board of directors has previously authorized a series of stock repurchase plans. Stock repurchases for each such plan could be executed through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases or other means. The board of directors authorized management to execute stock repurchase transactions from time to time and in such amounts and via such methods as management deemed appropriate. Each stock repurchase program could be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. 

On October 26, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan which authorized the Company to purchase up to $200 million of its outstanding common stock through October 26, 2017. Pursuant to this program, the Company made open market purchases during the three months ended   September   30, 2016 as follows (aggregate cost excludes broker commissions and is reflected in millions):

(2)
