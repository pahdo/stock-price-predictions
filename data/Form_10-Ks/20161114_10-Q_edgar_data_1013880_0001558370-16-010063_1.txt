(1)      OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Summary of Business 

TeleTech Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( TeleTech  or the  Company ) is a customer engagement management services provider, delivering integrated consulting, technology, growth and customer care solutions on a global scale. Our suite of products and services allows us to design and deliver engaging, outcome-based customer experiences across numerous interaction channels.

Basis of Presentation 

The Consolidated Financial Statements are comprised of the accounts of TeleTech, its wholly owned subsidiaries, its 55% equity owned subsidiary Percepta, LLC, and its 100% interest in iKnowtion, LLC effective January 2016 (see Note 12). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to state fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and the consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and the consolidated cash flows of the Company. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded an additional tax expense of $1.1 million that should have been recorded in prior periods related to operations by an entity outside its country of incorporation. The total amount of $1.1 million should have been recorded as additional expense in the amount of $180 thousand in 2011, $123 thousand in 2012, $137 thousand in 2013, $358 thousand in 2014 and $301 thousand in 2015. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2015, an additional expense of $1.75 million was recorded as an additional estimated tax liability that should have been recorded in prior periods related to ongoing discussions with relevant government authorities related to site compliance with tax advantaged status. The total amount of $1.75 million should have been recorded as additional tax expense in the amount of $466 thousand in 2012, $406 thousand in 2013, $645 thousand in 2014 and $234 thousand in the first quarter of 2015. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an additional $3.2 million loss related to foreign currency translation within Other comprehensive income (loss) that should have been recorded in 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015 to correct for an error in translating the financial results of Sofica Group AD, which the Company acquired on February 28, 2014. Of the $3.2 million recorded, approximately $1.7 million and $1.5 million should have been recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015, respectively. The Company also recorded an additional $2.7 million loss to  Other, net of tax  within Other comprehensive income (loss) in the three months ended March 31, 2015 related to the annual actuarial analysis for the Company s Philippines pension liability that should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.

During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an additional $2.9 million impairment to correct for an error in the goodwill impairment annual assessment and quarterly assessment for the WebMetro reporting unit. The Company should have recorded a $2.3 million impairment in the three months ended December 31, 2014 and an additional $0.6 million impairment in the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company has evaluated the aggregate impact of these adjustments and concluded that these adjustments were not material to the previously issued or current period consolidated financial statements. 

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to derivatives and hedging activities, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, self-insurance reserves, litigation reserves, restructuring reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, contingent consideration, and valuation of goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   . ASU 2014-09 provides new guidance related to how an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 specifies new accounting for costs associated with obtaining or fulfilling contracts with customers and expands the required disclosures related to revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. While ASU-2014-09 was originally effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,    Deferral of Effective Date   , deferring the effective date by one year, to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU 2014-09 can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption, with early application not permitted. The Company is currently determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   . ASU 2015-03 requires all costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. Beginning in 2016, the Company has applied the new guidance as applicable and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or related disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases   , which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The ASU also requires new disclosures regarding the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently assessing the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures evaluating software and other tracking methods, and determining the implementation timeline. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   , which amends the existing accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. The ASU simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has finalized the implementation which will occur effective January 1, 2017, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows   . ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice regarding how certain cash transactions are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact on the consolidated statements and related disclosures. 

(2)      ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 

rogenSi 

In the third quarter of 2014, as an addition to the Customer Strategy Services ( CSS ) segment, the Company acquired substantially all operating assets of rogenSi Worldwide PTY, Ltd., a global leadership, change management, sales, performance training and consulting company. 

The total purchase price was $34.4 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments, and consisted of $18.1 million in cash at closing and an estimated $14.5 million in three earn-out payments, contingent on the acquired companies and TeleTech s CSS segment achieving certain agreed earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) targets, as defined in the sale and purchase agreement. Additionally, the estimated purchase price included a $1.8 million hold-back payment for contingencies as defined in the sale and purchase agreement which was paid in the first quarter of 2016. The total contingent consideration possible per the sale and purchase agreement ranges from zero to $17.6 million and the earn-out payments are payable in early 2015, 2016 and 2017, based on July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and full year 2015 and 2016 performance, respectively.

(UNAUDITED) 

The fair value of the contingent consideration was measured by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based on significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). Key assumptions include a discount rate of 4.6% and expected future value of payments of $15.3 million. The $15.3 million of expected future payments was calculated using a probability weighted EBITDA assessment with the highest probability associated with rogenSi achieving the targeted EBITDA for each earn-out year. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $14.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the third quarter of 2015, the fourth quarter of 2015, and the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded fair value adjustments of the contingent consideration of $0.5 million, $0.8 million, $(0.3) million, and $(4.3) million, respectively, based on revised estimates noting higher or lower probability of exceeding the EBITDA targets (see Note 7). As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration has been reduced from $4.3 million to zero given the remote possibility of achieving targeted EBITDA for 2016. 

Sofica 

In the first quarter of 2014, as an addition to the Customer Management Services ( CMS ) segment, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Sofica Group, a Bulgarian joint stock company ( Sofica ). Sofica provides customer lifecycle management and other business process services across multiple channels in multiple sites in over 18 languages. 

The purchase price of $14.2 million included $9.4 million in cash consideration (including working capital adjustments) and an estimated $3.8 million in earn-out payments, payable in 2015 and 2016, contingent on Sofica achieving specified EBITDA targets, as defined by the stock purchase agreement. The total contingent consideration possible per the stock purchase agreement ranged from zero to $7.5 million. Additionally, the purchase price included a $1.0 million hold-back payment for contingencies, as defined in the stock purchase agreement, which was paid in the first quarter of 2016. 

The fair value of the contingent consideration was measured based on significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). Key assumptions include a discount rate of 5.0% and expected future value of payments of $4.0 million. The $4.0 million of expected future payments was calculated using a probability weighted EBITDA assessment with the highest probability associated with Sofica achieving the targeted EBITDA for each earn-out year. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $3.8 million. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company recorded fair value adjustments of the contingent consideration of $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, based on revised estimates noting higher probability of exceeding the EBITDA targets (see Note 7). During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a negative fair value adjustment for contingent consideration of $0.5 million based on revised estimates noting lower profitability than initially estimated. As of September 30, 2016, all of the contingent consideration has been paid. 

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has determined that one business unit from the Customer Growth Services segment and one business unit from the Customer Strategy Services segment will be divested from the Company s operations. These business units have met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The Company is in discussions with bankers, a potential broker and assessing potential buyers. The Company anticipates the transactions will be finalized during the next six to twelve months. The Company has taken into consideration the discounted cash flow models, management input based on early discussions with potential brokers and buyers, and other third party evidence from similar transactions to complete the fair value analysis as there has not been a selling price determined at this point for either unit. The fair values were compared to the carrying values to estimate any potential loss on sale. For the two business units losses of $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, were recorded as of September 30, 2016 in Loss on assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

( Atelka ), a Canadian customer contact center management and business process outsourcing services company that serves Canadian telecommunications, logistics, and entertainment clients. Atelka employs  approximately 2,800 in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. 

The Company paid CAN $59.0 million (USD $44 million) adjusted for Atelka s net debt, net working capital, and subject to CAN $2.0 million purchase price hold-back to be released in part over twelve and 24 months periods net of payments that may be due with respect to customary acquisition related indemnities.

(4)      SIGNIFICANT CLIENTS AND OTHER CONCENTRATIONS 

The Company had one client that contributed in excess of 10% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This client operates in the communications industry and is included in the CMS segment. This client contributed 10.7% and 10.5% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This client contributed 10.4% and 10.8% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This client had an outstanding receivable balance of $31.3 million and $16.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The loss of one or more of its significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results, or financial condition. The Company does not require collateral from its clients. To limit the Company s credit risk, management performs periodic credit evaluations of its clients, maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts and may require pre-payment for services. Although the Company is impacted by economic conditions in various industry segments, management does not believe significant credit risk existed as of September 30, 2016. 

(5)      GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Goodwill consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The Company performs a goodwill impairment assessment on at least an annual basis. The Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist.  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified negative indicators such as lower financial performance and the reversal of contingent consideration for the CSS reporting unit and thus the Company updated its quantitative assessment for the CSS reporting unit fair value using an income based approach. The determination of fair value requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term growth rates for the businesses, the useful lives over which the cash flows will occur and determination of appropriate discount rates (based in part on the Company s weighted average cost of capital). Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. At September 30, 2016, the fair value for the CSS reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and thus no impairment was required. 

The Company has also determined that effective September 30, 2016 the assets of one of the business units within the CSS reporting unit will be held for sale (see discussion in Note 2). Therefore the CSS reporting unit was separated into the component that will be held for sale and the components that will be held for use and two separate fair value analyses were completed. At September 30, 2016 the fair value for the CSS held for use component exceeded the carrying value and thus no impairment was required. The fair value for the CSS held for sale component also exceeded the carrying value and thus no impairment was required. 

CSS   component held-for-sale 

The Company calculated the fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty method based on forecasted revenues sold under the trade name using significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). The valuation assumptions included an estimated royalty rate of 3.75%, a discount rate specific to the trade name of 19.2% and a perpetuity growth rate of 3.0%. Based on the calculated fair value of $2.0 million, the Company recorded impairment expense of $3.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 which was included in Impairment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

WebMetro reporting unit 

At September 30, 2015, the Company updated its quantitative assessment for the WebMetro reporting unit fair value using an income based approach based on a relatively small margin of fair value in excess of carrying value as of December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2015, the updated fair value for WebMetro was below the carrying value which necessitated an interim impairment analysis. The Company tested all of the assets of this reporting unit for impairment. 

Definite-lived long-lived assets consisted of fixed assets, internally developed software, and an intangible asset related to the WebMetro customer relationships. The Company determined that the undiscounted future cash flows would be sufficient to cover the net book value of all definite-lived long-lived assets. 

For the goodwill impairment analysis, the Company calculated the fair value of the WebMetro reporting unit and compared that to the updated carrying value and determined that the fair value was not in excess of its carrying value. Key assumptions used in the fair value calculation for goodwill impairment testing include, but are not limited to, a compounded annual revenue growth rate of 20% for the years 2016 through 2019, a perpetuity growth rate of 4.0% based on the current inflation rate combined with the GDP growth rate for the reporting unit s geographical region and a discount rate of 17.0%, which is equal to the reporting unit s equity risk premium adjusted for its size and company specific risk factors. Estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on the Company s internal business plan adjusted as appropriate for the Company s view of market participant assumptions. The current business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events, including increased revenue growth for the next several years. Significant differences in the outcome of some or all of these assumptions may impact the calculated fair value of this reporting unit resulting in a different outcome to goodwill impairment in a future period. 

Since the fair value of the reporting unit was not in excess of its carrying value, the Company calculated the implied fair value of goodwill and compared that value to the carrying value of goodwill. Implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over the amounts assigned to its net identifiable assets and liabilities. Upon completing this assessment, the Company determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value and thus a $3.1 million impairment was recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, and was included in Impairment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

Other Intangible Assets 

In connection with reduced profitability for the Avaya component of the  CTS segment an interim impairment analysis was completed during the third quarter of 2016. The Company will modify the sales focus of the Avaya component away from premise product and services towards cloud solutions.  The indefinite-lived intangible asset evaluated for impairment consisted of the TSG trade name. The Company calculated the fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty method based on forecasted revenues sold under the trade name using significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). The valuation assumptions included an estimated royalty rate of 0.5%, a discount rate specific to the trade name of 19.0%, which is equal to the reporting unit s equity risk premium adjusted for its size and company specific risk factors. and a perpetuity growth rate of 3.0%. Based on the calculated fair value of $0.4 million, the Company recorded impairment expense of $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 which was included in Impairment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

In connection with reduced profitability of the rogenSi component of the CSS segment, an interim impairment analysis was completed during the third quarter of 2016. The indefinite-lived intangible asset evaluated for impairment consisted of the trade name. The Company calculated the fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty method based on forecasted revenues sold under the trade name using significant inputs not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). The valuation assumptions included an estimated royalty rate of 2.0%, a discount rate specific to the trade name of 18.2%, which is equal to the reporting unit s equity risk premium adjusted for its size and company specific risk factors. and a perpetuity growth rate of 3.0%. Based on the calculated fair value of $3.1 million, the Company recorded impairment expense of $1.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 which was included in Impairment losses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

(6)      DERIVATIVES 

Cash Flow Hedges 

The Company enters into foreign exchange and interest rate related derivatives. Foreign exchange derivatives entered into consist of forward and option contracts to reduce the Company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are associated with forecasted revenue earned in foreign locations. Interest rate derivatives consist of interest rate swaps to reduce the Company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with its variable rate debt. Upon proper qualification, these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. It is the Company s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with investment grade counterparty financial institutions, and correspondingly, the fair value of derivative assets consider, among other factors, the creditworthiness of these counterparties. Conversely, the fair value of derivative liabilities reflects the Company s creditworthiness. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not experienced, nor does it anticipate, any issues related to derivative counterparty defaults. The following table summarizes the aggregate unrealized net gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands and net of tax): 

The Company s foreign exchange cash flow hedging instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows (amounts in thousands). All hedging instruments are forward contracts.

(7)      FAIR VALUE 

The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires that the Company maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 

The following presents information as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the Company s assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the fair value hierarchy used to determine their fair value. 

Accounts Receivable and Payable    - The amounts recorded in the accompanying balance sheets approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. 

Investments     The Company measures investments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include market observable inputs, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. As of September 30, 2016, the investment, which consists of the Company s first quarter 2015 $9.0 million investment in Caf X Communication, Inc., continues to be recorded at $9.0 million.

Debt   - The Company s debt consists primarily of the Company s Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 10), which permits floating-rate borrowings based upon the current Prime Rate or LIBOR plus a credit spread as determined by the Company s leverage ratio calculation (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $129.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. During the third quarter of 2016 outstanding borrowings accrued interest at an average rate of 1.5% per annum, excluding unused commitment fees. The amounts recorded in the accompanying Balance Sheets approximate fair value due to the variable nature of the debt. 

Derivatives -   Net derivative assets (liabilities) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The portfolio is valued using models based on market observable inputs, including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates, interest rates, implied volatility, and counterparty credit risk, including the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract. As of September 30, 2016, credit risk did not materially change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts.

Deferred Compensation Plan     The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan structured as a Rabbi trust for certain eligible employees. Participants in the deferred compensation plan select from a menu of phantom investment options for their deferral dollars offered by the Company each year, which are based upon changes in value of complementary, defined market investments. The deferred compensation liability represents the combined values of market investments against which participant accounts are tracked. 

Contingent Consideration     The Company recorded contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of iKnowtion, Sofica and rogenSi. These contingent payables were recognized at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach and a discount rate of 21.0%, 5.0% or 4.6%, respectively. The discount rates vary dependant on the specific risks of each acquisition including the country of operation, the nature of services and complexity of the acquired business, and other similar factors. These measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The Company recorded interest expense each period using the effective interest method until the future value of these contingent payables reached their expected future value. Interest expense related to all recorded contingent payables is included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration associated with the Sofica reporting unit within the CMS segment based on revised estimates reflecting that Sofica earnings would be lower than revised estimates for 2015. Accordingly a $0.5 million decrease in the payable was recorded as of June 30, 2015 and was included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2016, all payments have been completed. 

During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, and the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded fair value adjustments of the contingent consideration associated with the rogenSi reporting unit within the CSS segment based on revised estimates reflecting that rogenSi earnings would be higher and then lower than anticipated for 2015. Accordingly a $0.5 million increase, a $0.3 million decrease, and a $4.3 million decrease to the payable was recorded as of September 30, 2015, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, respectively, and was included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration has been reduced to zero given the remote possibility of any additional payments. 

A rollforward of the activity in the Company s fair value of the contingent consideration payable is as follows (in thousands): 

(8)      INCOME TAXES 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the accounting literature for income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Quarterly, the Company assesses the likelihood that its net deferred tax assets will be recovered. Based on the weight of all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that a future tax benefit will not be realized. 

In accordance with ASC 740, the Company recorded a liability during the second quarter of 2015 of $1.75 million and during the first quarter of 2016 of $1.1 million, inclusive of penalties and interest, for uncertain tax positions. See Note 1 for further information on these items. 

During the second quarter of 2016, $0.3 million of liability was released due to the closing of a statute of limitations.  

During the third quarter of 2016, $0.8 million of liability was released due to the favorable outcome of communications with a revenue authority related to site compliance for locations with tax advantaged status. 

During the third quarter of 2016, $0.5 million of liability was released due to the closing of a statute of limitations. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $55.3 million of gross deferred tax assets (after a $9.9 million valuation allowance) and net deferred tax assets (after deferred tax liabilities) of $53.2 million related to the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions whose recoverability is dependent upon future profitability.

The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was (6.9)% and 15.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 8.7% and 21.9%, respectively. 

The Company s U.S. income tax returns filed for the tax years ending December 31, 2013 to present remain open tax years. The Company has been notified of the intent to audit, or is currently under audit, of income taxes for rogenSi in Hong Kong for the tax year 2014, Canada for tax years 2009 and 2010 and New Zealand for tax year the 2013. Although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities are always uncertain, it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these audits will not have a material effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has successfully closed their audit in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2016 for the acquired entity Technology Solutions Group for the tax year 2012 (prior to acquisition), with no changes. 

The Company has been granted  Tax Holidays  as an incentive to attract foreign investment by the governments of the Philippines and Costa Rica. Generally, a Tax Holiday is an agreement between the Company and a foreign government under which the Company receives certain tax benefits in that country, such as exemption from taxation on profits derived from export-related activities. In the Philippines, the Company has been granted multiple agreements with an initial period of four years and additional periods for varying years, expiring at various times between 2011 and 2020. The aggregate effect on income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which had a favorable impact on diluted net income per share of $0.04 and $0.04, respectively. The aggregate effect on income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $4.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively, which had a favorable impact on diluted net income per share of $0.10 and $0.09, respectively. 

(9)      RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES 

Restructuring Charges 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company continued restructuring activities primarily associated with reductions in the Company s capacity, workforce and related management in all of the segments to better align the capacity and workforce with current business needs. 

A summary of the expenses recorded in Restructuring, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is as follows (in thousands):

A rollforward of the activity in the Company s restructuring accruals is as follows (in thousands): 

The remaining restructuring accruals are expected to be paid or extinguished during 2016 or 2017 and are all classified as current liabilities within Other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Impairment Losses 

During each of the periods presented, the Company evaluated the recoverability of its leasehold improvement assets at certain delivery centers. An asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of its asset group are estimated to be less than the asset group s carrying value. The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. To determine fair value, the Company used Level 3 inputs in its discounted cash flows analysis. Assumptions included the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized no losses related to leasehold improvement assets. 

(10)      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Credit Facility 

On February 11, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to our June 3, 2013 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Amended and Restated Security Agreement (collectively the  Credit Agreement ) for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of lenders led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Credit Agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility that matures on February 11, 2021 with an initial maximum aggregate commitment of $900.0 million, and an accordion feature of up to $1.2 billion in the aggregate, if certain conditions are satisfied.  

Base rate loans bear interest at a rate equal to the greatest of (i) Wells Fargo s prime rate, (ii) one half of 1% in excess of the federal funds effective rate, and (iii) 1.25% in excess of the one month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ); plus in each case a margin of 0% to 0.75% based on the Company s net leverage ratio. Eurodollar loans bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.0% to 1.75% based on the Company s net leverage ratio. Alternate currency loans bear interest at rates applicable to their respective currencies.

The Company is obligated to maintain a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00. 

The Company primarily utilizes its Credit Agreement to fund working capital, general operations, stock repurchases, dividends and other strategic activities, such as the acquisitions described in Note 2. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had borrowings of $129.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, under its Credit Agreement, and its average daily utilization was $359.5 million and $323.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. After consideration for issued letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, totaling $3.4 million, and current level of availability based on covenant calculations, the Company s remaining borrowing capacity was approximately $425 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and conditions under its Credit Agreement. 

Letters of Credit 

As of September 30, 2016, outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement totaled $3.4 million and primarily guaranteed workers  compensation and other insurance related obligations. As of September 30, 2016, letters of credit and contract performance guarantees issued outside of the Credit Agreement totaled $5.5 million. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company has been involved in legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for exposures associated with such legal actions to the extent that losses are deemed both probable and reasonably estimable. To the extent specific reserves have not been made for certain legal proceedings, their ultimate outcome, and consequently, an estimate of possible loss, if any, cannot reasonably be determined at this time. 

Based on currently available information and advice received from counsel, the Company believes that the disposition or ultimate resolution of any current legal proceedings, except as otherwise specifically reserved for in its financial statements, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

(12)      MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 

The Company held an 80% interest in iKnowtion until January 1, 2016 when the additional 20% was purchased. In the event iKnowtion met certain EBITDA targets for calendar year 2015, the purchase and sale agreement required TeleTech to purchase the remaining 20% interest in iKnowtion in 2016 for an amount equal to a multiple of iKnowtion s 2015 EBITDA as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. These terms represented a contingent redemption feature which the Company determined was probable of being achieved.  

Based on final EBITDA for 2015, the payment for the remaining 20% was completed in April 2016 for the value shown in the table below in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement. 

The Company recorded the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest at the redemption value based on the corresponding EBITDA multiples as prescribed in the purchase and sale agreement at the end of each reporting period. At the end of each reporting period the changes in the redemption value were recorded in retained earnings. Since the EBITDA multiples as defined in the purchase and sale agreement are below the current market multiple, the Company has determined that there was no preferential treatment to the noncontrolling interest shareholders resulting in no impact to earnings per share.  

A rollforward of the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest is included in the table below (in thousands).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, options to purchase 0.1 million and 0.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the exercise price exceeded the value of the shares and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, restricted stock units ( RSUs ) of 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, were outstanding, but not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND   

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary

( TeleTech ,  the Company ,  we ,  our  or  us ) is a customer engagement management service provider that delivers integrated consulting, technology, growth and customer care solutions on a global scale. Our suite of products and services allows us to design and deliver engaging, outcome-based customer experiences across numerous interaction channels. Our solutions are supported by 43,500 employees delivering services in 24 countries from 73 delivery centers on six continents. Our revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $313 million. 

Since our establishment in 1982, we have helped clients strengthen their customer relationships, brand recognition and loyalty through customer engagement solutions. We deliver thought leadership, technology and innovation that create customer strategies designed to differentiate our clients from their competition; data analytics that personalize interactions and increase customer value; and integration services that connect clients  customer relationship management ( CRM ) system to a cloud-based collaboration platform, leading to customer interactions that are seamless and relevant. 

Our services are value-oriented, outcome-based, and delivered on a global scale across all of our business segments: Customer Management Services ( CMS ), Customer Growth Services ( CGS ), Customer Technology Services ( CTS ) and Customer Strategy Services ( CSS ). Our integrated customer experience managed services platform differentiates the Company by combining strategic consulting, data analytics, process optimization, system design and integration, operational excellence, and technology solutions and services. 

We have developed tailored expertise in the automotive, communications, financial services, government, healthcare, logistics, media and entertainment, retail, technology, travel and transportation industries. We target customer-focused industry leaders in the Global 1000 and serve approximately 300 global clients. 

To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and stay strategically relevant to our clients, we continue to invest in innovation and growth businesses, diversifying our traditional business process outsourcing services of our CMS segment into higher-value consulting, data analytics, digital marketing and technology-enabled services. Of the $312.8 million in revenue we reported in the current period, approximately 28.5% or $89.1 million came from the CGS, CTS and CSS segments (our  Emerging Segments ), focused on customer-centric strategy, growth and technology-based services, with the remainder of our revenue coming from our CMS contact center business. 

Our strong balance sheet, cash flows from operations and access to debt and capital markets have historically provided us the financial flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and incremental investments. Additionally, we continue to return capital to our shareholders via an ongoing stock repurchase program and regular semi-annual dividends. As of September 30, 2016, our cumulative authorized repurchase allowance was $712.3 million, of which we repurchased 44.8 million shares for $700.0 million. For the period from September 30, 2016 through October 31, 2016, we repurchased 229 thousand additional shares. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date. On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase allowance of $25 million.

On February 24, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy, with the intent to distribute a periodic cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock, after consideration of, among other things, TeleTech s performance, cash flows, capital needs and liquidity factors. Given our cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we believe cash dividends and early returns to shareholders through share repurchases, in balance with our investments in innovation and strategic acquisitions, align shareholder interests with the needs of the Company. The initial dividend of $0.18 per common share was paid on March 16, 2015 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2015. A second dividend of $0.18 per common share was paid on October 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2015. A third dividend of $0.185 per common share was paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2016. A fourth dividend of $0.20 per common share was paid on October 14, 2016 to shareholders of record as of October 3, 2016. 

Our Integrated Service Offerings and Business Segments 

We have four operating and reportable segments, which provide an integrated set of services including: 

Customer Strategy Services 

We typically begin by engaging our clients at a strategic level. Through our strategy, change management and analytics-driven consulting expertise, we help our clients design, build and execute their customer engagement strategies. We help our clients to better understand and predict their customers  behaviors and preferences along with their current and future economic value. Using proprietary analytic models, we provide the insight clients need to build the business case for customer centricity, to better optimize their marketing spend and then work alongside them to help implement our recommendations. A key component of this segment involves instilling a high performance culture through management and leadership alignment and process optimization. 

Customer Technology Services 

Once the design of the customer engagement is completed, our ability to architect, deploy and host or manage the client s customer management environment becomes a key enabler to achieving and sustaining the client s customer engagement vision. Given the proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices, we enable our clients  operations to interact with their customers across the growing array of channels including email, social networks, mobile, web, SMS text, voice and chat. We design, implement and manage cloud, on-premise or hybrid customer management environments to deliver a consistent and superior experience across all touch points on a global scale that we believe result in higher quality, lower costs and reduced risk for our clients. Through our proprietary Humanify  technology, we also provide data-driven context aware SaaS-based solutions that link customers seamlessly and directly to appropriate resources, any time and across any channel. 

Customer Management Services 

We design and manage clients  front-to-back office processes to deliver just-in-time, personalized, multi-channel interactions. Our front-office solutions seamlessly integrate voice, chat, email, e-commerce and social media to optimize the customer experience for our clients. In addition, we manage certain client back-office processes to enhance their customer-centric view of relationships and maximize operating efficiencies. Our delivery of integrated business processes via our onshore, offshore or work-from-home associates reduces operating costs and allows customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently, resulting in higher satisfaction, brand loyalty and a stronger competitive position for our clients.

Customer Growth Services 

We offer integrated sales and marketing solutions to help our clients boost revenue in new, fragmented or underpenetrated business-to-consumer or business-to-business markets. We deliver approximately $2 billion in client revenue annually via the acquisition, growth and retention of customers through a combination of our highly trained, client-dedicated sales professionals and our proprietary Revana Analytic Multichannel Platform  TM  . This platform continuously aggregates individual customer information across all channels into one holistic view so as to ensure more relevant and personalized communications. As a result of our acquisition of the digital agency WebMetro, we have developed an integrated marketing-to-sales platform that links online searches to live sales through a closed loop, multichannel interface. This platform uses proprietary tools and methodology to capture and use more than 400 marketing and sales data points to engage with customers in relevant conversations. 

Based on our clients  requirements, we provide our services on an integrated cross-business segment and on a discrete basis.

In the third quarter of 2016, our revenue increased 1.2% to $312.8 million over the same period in 2015 including a decrease of 0.1% or $0.3 million due to foreign currency fluctuations. This increase in revenue is comprised of growth of 5.2% in the CMS segment offset by a reduction in the CSS segment due to decreases in our Middle East consulting business in connection with macro-economic trends and decreases in the CTS segment due to lower Avaya revenue and product sales. Revenue, adjusted for the $0.3 million decrease related to foreign exchange, increased by $3.9 million, or 1.3%, over the prior year.  

Our third quarter 2016 income from operations decreased 19.8% to $12.5 million or 4.0% of revenue, from  $15.6 million or 5.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily due to $3.7 million of restructuring charges related to a reorganization of the global sales force and a restructuring of a portion of the IT functions, and impairments of $5.6 million for several trade name intangible assets due to continued lower financial performance for three business units (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These were offset by increased income for the CMS segment related to higher revenue. Income from operations in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 included $9.3 million and $3.7 million of restructuring charges and asset impairments, respectively. 

Our offshore delivery centers serve clients based in the U.S. and in other countries and spans five countries with 22,500 workstations, representing 63% of our global delivery capability. Revenue for our CMS and CGS segments that is provided in these offshore locations was $111 million and represented 43% of our revenue for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $110 million and 44% of our revenue for 2015. 

Our cash flow from operations and available credit allowed us to finance a significant portion of our capital needs and stock repurchases through internally generated cash flows. At September 30, 2016, we had $61.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, total debt of $140.9 million, and a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 26.3%.

Table of Contents  

We internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at 80% to 90% of our available workstations. As of September 30, 2016, the overall capacity utilization in our centers was 71%. The table below presents workstation data for all of our centers as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations. 

While we continue to see demand from all geographic regions to utilize our offshore delivery capabilities and expect this trend to continue with our clients, some of our clients have regulatory pressures to bring the services onshore to the United States. In light of these trends we plan to continue to selectively retain and grow capacity and expand into new offshore markets, while maintaining appropriate capacity in the United States. As we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increases, we continue to actively manage this risk via a multi-currency hedging program designed to minimize operating margin volatility.

Refer to Part I, Item I, Financial Statements, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented. For further information, please refer to the discussion of all critical accounting policies in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

All inter-company transactions between the reported segments for the periods presented have been eliminated. 

Customer Management Services 

The increase in revenue for the Customer Management Services segment was attributable to a $15.7 million net increase in client programs offset by program completions of $4.7 million.  

The operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 5.5% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 4.2% in the prior period. The operating margin increased due to higher revenue which improved the capacity utilization as well as cost reductions implemented in the third quarter to resize the sales and marketing functions and restructuring portions of the IT functions.  Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Growth Services 

The increase in revenue for the Customer Growth Services segment was due to a $4.0 million increase in client programs offset by program completions of $2.6 million. 

The operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 0.5% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a loss of (0.8)% in the prior period. This small increase in margin is related to the higher revenue. Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $0.5 million and $0.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Technology Services 

The decrease in revenue for the Customer Technology Services segment was driven by decreases in the Avaya offerings as well as lower CISCO product sales. 

34 

Table of Contents  

The operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.3% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 9.0% in the prior period. During the quarter, a $0.7 million charge for the impairment of a trade name intangible asset was recorded due to continued lower financial performance for the Avaya business unit (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This  was offset by improvements in the margins for the CISCO platform and reductions in the selling, general and administrative expenses due to certain restructuring efforts. Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $1.2 million and $1.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Strategy Services 

The decrease in revenue for the Customer Strategy Services segment was most significantly related to declines in the Middle East consulting business consistent with the first half of 2016. 

The operating loss as a percentage of revenue was (21.3)% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to income of 15.5% in the prior period. The loss included $4.5 million of charges for the impairment of two trade name intangible assets due to continued lower financial performance for two business units (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The operating income also decreased related to the decline in revenue which caused an under utilization of the consultants as well as planned investments in practice area and geographic expansion. Included in the operating income was amortization expense of $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Interest Income (Expense) 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 interest income increased to $0.4 million from $0.2 million in the same period in 2015. Interest expense decreased to $2.0 million during 2016 from $2.3 million during 2015. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a total of $5.3 million of estimated losses related to two business units which have been classified as assets held for sale (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a $4.3 million benefit related to a fair value adjustment of contingent consideration for one of our acquisitions (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2015 was a $0.8 million expense related to fair value adjustments of contingent consideration for one of our acquisitions (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was (6.9)%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 8.7% for the comparable period of 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was influenced by earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday and the distribution of income between the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Without $1.1 million of benefit related to uncertain tax positions, $0.6 million of expense related to return to provision adjustments, $1.3 million of benefit from restructuring expenses, $0.4 million of benefit related to impairments, $1.1 million of benefit related to losses recorded on assets held for sale, and $0.1 million of expense related to the write off of contingent payments, the Company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 would have been 11.0%.

Customer Management Services 

The decrease in revenue for the Customer Management Services segment was attributable to a $21.0 million net increase in client programs offset by program completions of $14.9 million.

The operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 6.5% in the prior period. The operating margin decrease is attributable to a shift in business mix to onshore vs. offshore, overall lower capacity utilization and the adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Growth Services 

The increase in revenue for the Customer Growth Services segment was due to a $22.7 million increase in client programs offset by program completions of $6.1 million and a $1.3 million reduction due to foreign currency fluctuations. 

The operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 3.9%  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2.1% in the prior period. This was attributable to increased revenue and improvements in the efficiency of the selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $1.8 million and $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Technology Services 

The decrease in revenue for the Customer Technology Services segment was driven by a small increase for the CISCO offerings offset by decreases for the Avaya offerings.

The operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 9.1%  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the prior period. Included in the income was an $0.7 million charge related to the impairment of a trade name intangible asset due to continued lower financial performance of the Avaya business unit (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  This was offset by increases in the profitability of the CISCO platform including Cloud, Managed Service and Consulting services. Included in the operating income was amortization related to acquired intangibles of $3.4 million and $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Customer Strategy Services 

The decrease in revenue for the Customer Strategy Services segment was most significantly related to the decrease in Middle East consulting business as well as some revenue volatility in other regions. 

The operating loss as a percentage of revenue was (7.4)%  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to income of 16.1% in the prior period. The loss included $4.5 million of charges for the impairment of two trade name intangible assets due to continued lower performance of two business units (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The operating margin decrease also related to lower revenue which caused an under utilization of the consultants as well as the planned investments in practice areas and geographic expansion. Included in the operating income was amortization expense of $2.3 million and $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Interest Income (Expense) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 interest income decreased to $0.8 million from $0.9 million in the same period in 2015. Interest expense increased to $5.8 million during 2016 from $5.7 million during 2015. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a total of $5.3 million of estimated losses related to two business units which have been classified as assets held for sale (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a $4.3 million benefit related to a fair value adjustment of contingent consideration for one of our acquisitions (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7 to the Consolidated financial Statements for further details). 

Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a $0.5 million benefit and a $0.8 million expense related to fair value adjustments of contingent consideration for two of our acquisitions (see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 7 to the Consolidated financial Statements for further details). 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 15.2%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 21.9% for the comparable period of 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was influenced by earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday and the distribution of income between the U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Without $0.3 million of benefit related to a reserve for uncertain tax positions, $1.2 million of expense related to return to provision, $1.1 million of expense related to valuation allowances, $1.3 million of benefit from restructuring expenses,  $0.5 million of benefit related to impairments, $1.1 million of benefit related to losses recorded on businesses held for sale, $0.1 million of expense related to the write off of contingent payments, and $0.1 million benefit related to other items, the Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have been 13.9%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, our cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated positive operating cash flows of $107.1 million. We believe that our cash generated from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. 

We manage a centralized global treasury function in the United States with a focus on concentrating and safeguarding our global cash and cash equivalents. While the majority of our cash is held outside the U.S., we prefer to hold U.S. Dollars in addition to the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to use our offshore cash to support working capital and growth of our foreign operations. While there are no assurances, we believe our global cash is protected given our cash management practices, banking partners and utilization of diversified, high quality investments. 

We have global operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may positively or negatively impact our liquidity. We are also exposed to higher interest rates associated with our variable rate debt. To mitigate these risks, we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps through our cash flow hedging program. Please refer to Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Foreign Currency Risk, for further discussion. 

The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $61.3 million and $60.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We diversify the holdings of such cash and cash equivalents considering the financial condition and stability of the counterparty institutions. 

We reinvest our cash flows to grow our client base, expand our infrastructure, for investment in research and development, for strategic acquisitions, for the purchase of our outstanding stock and to pay dividends. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash flows provided by operating activities was $107.1 million and $116.2 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to $5.8 million in cash paid for prepaid assets and a $24.9 million increase in payments made for operating expenses, offset by a $19.1 million increase in cash collected from accounts receivable. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of $39.2 million and $59.8 million, respectively. The decrease was due to a $10.3 million decrease in capital expenditures and the $9.0 million investment made during the first nine months of 2015. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported net cash flows used in financing activities of $57.3 million and $27.5 million, respectively. The change in net cash flows from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in the Credit Facility, a decrease in the contingent consideration and hold-back acquisition payments of $2.4 million, offset by a $40.7 million increase in purchases of our outstanding common stock, and $1.9 million paid for debt reissuance costs. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow (see  Presentation of Non-GAAP Measurements  below for the definition of free cash flow) increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a decrease in capital expenditures. Free cash flow was $68.3 million and $67.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Measurements 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measurement. We believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure determined by GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for  income from operations,   net income,   net cash provided by operating activities,  or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful, in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of  net cash provided by operating activities,  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, since it includes cash required for debt service. Free cash flow also includes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions, investments and other needs that may arise. 

The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for our consolidated results (in thousands): 

Obligations and Future Capital Requirements 

Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 

Includes estimated interest payments based on the weighted-average interest rate, unused commitment fees, current interest rate swap arrangements, and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2016.     

Contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate.     

Purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods or services not yet received, which are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until such goods and/or services are received.     

The contractual obligation table excludes our liabilities of $3.4 million related to uncertain tax positions because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of cash payments.     

Our outstanding debt is primarily associated with the use of funds under our Credit Agreement to fund working capital, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends, and for other cash flow needs across our global operations. 

Future Capital Requirements 

We expect total capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately 4.2% of revenue. Approximately 65% of these expected capital expenditures are to support growth in our business and 35% relate to the maintenance for   

39 

Table of Contents  

existing assets. The anticipated level of 2016 capital expenditures is primarily driven by new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure. 

The amount of capital required over the next 12 months will depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain, upgrade or replace existing assets. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital upon commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us. 

Client Concentration 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one of our clients represented 10.4% of our total revenue. Our five largest clients accounted for 36.4% and 37.0% of our consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our five largest clients accounted for 35.8% and 35.8% of our consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have experienced long-term relationships with our top five clients, ranging from 10 to 20 years, with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us. The relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis and varies greatly based upon specific contract terms. In addition, clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements. We believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated, in part, by the long-term contracts we have with our largest clients. Although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party, we believe this risk is mitigated, in part, by the service level disruptions and transition/migration costs that would arise for our clients. 

The contracts with our five largest clients expire between 2017 and 2020. Additionally, a particular client may have multiple contracts with different expiration dates. We have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients. However, there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed, or if renewed, will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates. Market risk also includes credit and non-performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments. We are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates (as measured against the U.S. dollar); as well as credit risk associated with potential non-performance of our counterparty banks. These exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities. We enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes, primarily between the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar, the U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso, and the Australian dollar/Philippine peso. We enter into interest rate derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt. To mitigate against credit and non-performance risk, it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and, correspondingly, our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties. As of the date of this report, we have not experienced, nor do we anticipate, any issues related to derivative counterparty defaults. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We entered into interest rate derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt. The interest rate on our Credit Agreement is variable based upon the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds rate, or LIBOR and, therefore, is affected by changes in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, we had $129.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Based upon average outstanding borrowings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest accrued at a rate of approximately 1.5% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. If the Prime Rate or LIBOR increased by 100 basis points during the quarter, there would be a $1.0 million of additional interest expense per $100.0 million of outstanding borrowing under the Credit Agreement.

The Company s interest rate swap arrangements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

Foreign Currency Risk 

Our subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and the Philippines use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs. Conversely, revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. As a result, we may experience foreign currency gains or losses, which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue associated with this foreign exchange risk was 33% and 31% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. 

In order to mitigate the risk of these non-functional foreign currencies weakening against the functional currencies of the servicing subsidiaries, which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries, we may hedge a portion, though not 100%, of the projected foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries through our cash flow hedging program. While our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term, an overall weakening of the non-functional foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the servicing subsidiary over the long term. 

Cash Flow Hedging Program 

To reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with forecasted revenue in non-functional currencies, we purchase forward and/or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future. We have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue in non-functional currencies. 

While we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions, as this is part of transacting business in an international environment. Not every exposure is or can be hedged and, where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate. Failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could adversely affect our consolidated operating results. 

Our cash flow hedging instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows (in thousands). All hedging instruments are forward contracts, except as noted.

Includes contracts to purchase Philippine pesos in exchange for New Zealand dollars and Australian dollars, which are translated into equivalent U.S. dollars on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     

The fair value of our cash flow hedges at September 30, 2016 was assets/(liabilities) (in thousands): 

Our cash flow hedges are valued using models based on market observable inputs, including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates, implied volatility, and counterparty credit risk. The increase in fair value from December 31, 2015 largely reflects a broad weakening in the U.S. dollar. 

We recorded net losses of approximately $18.9 million and $8.2 million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These losses were reflected in Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). If the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by 10% from current period-end levels, we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts. However, any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding increases or decreases in our underlying exposures. 

Other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of the transactions of our U.S. and foreign operations are denominated in their respective local currency. However, transactions are denominated in other currencies from time-to-time. We do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 22% and 23%, respectively, of revenue was derived from contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results from operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the U.S. Dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. 

Fair Value of Debt and Equity Securities 

We did not have any investments in marketable debt or equity securities as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer (the  CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer (the  CFO ) required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.

Table of Contents  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

Management of the Company, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period. Based on that evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 

At the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting which continued to exist as of September 30, 2016. These material weaknesses are fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

While these material weaknesses did not result in errors that were material to our annual or interim financial statements, they could result in misstatements of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures which would result in material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures which would not be prevented or detected.  

Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls 

Our management, including the CEO and CFO, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control are met. Further, the design of internal controls must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations within internal controls include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by unauthorized override of controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. While the objective of the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of controls, such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and such assumptions, while reasonable, may not take into account all potential future conditions. Thus, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Therefore, because of the inherent limitations in cost effective internal controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected. 

Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 

Building on its efforts during 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016, our management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our board of directors, continued in the third quarter of 2016 to dedicate significant resources and efforts to improve our control environment and take steps to remediate the material weaknesses identified. While certain remedial actions have been completed, we continue to actively implement additional control procedures. The remediation efforts taken in 2016, outlined below, and previously taken in 2015, as outlined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, are intended both to address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance our overall financial control environment.

Table of Contents  

Remediation Actions for Control Environment  : 

We hired additional personnel and established appropriate roles and responsibilities within our global finance and accounting organization to improve our knowledge and expertise over financial reporting. Since mid-year 2015, we have been actively upgrading key accounting leadership personnel in the United States, Philippines, and Mexico. Our focus is on upgrading personnel that have responsibilities for the knowledge of and technical expertise in US GAAP. We appointed a VP accounting operations, two assistant controllers with responsibility for our reporting segments, additional technical accounting staff, and managers to facilitate coordination of our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and our external audit.      

In addition, we engaged an independent third party expert to assist us in our review of our control structure, including a comprehensive risk assessment with respect to our internal controls, and to provide constructive recommendations for optimization of our controls and control environment, including our implementation of a periodic monitoring process for the design and operating effectiveness of our control activities. We have implemented these expert recommendations and have upgraded our control structure, but we can provide no assurance as to the timing of when the material weaknesses will be remediated as a result of these changes.     

We have implemented comprehensive training for our accounting managers designed to provide our personnel with knowledge, experience, and training in the application of generally accepted accounting principles commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. We plan to include a program of continuous education for our new staff and refresher courses for existing staff on an ongoing basis.     

Remediation Actions for Account Reconciliations 

Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, we implemented enhanced control procedures over our reconciliation process including tracking and monitoring the completeness of reconciliations.     

Beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we implemented additional balance sheet and income statement analytics designed to further enhance our ability to detect material misstatements within our financial statements. We have implemented these analyses to further strengthen the control environment in which our financial information is compiled and provide additional assurances as to the fair presentation of our financial statements.     

Remediation Actions for Journal Entries 

We have reviewed our accounting system configuration and are implementing the necessary system controls to eliminate the ability for a user to create and post a journal entry.     

We have integrated our acquired companies onto our accounting system which has system controls to prevent a user from posting and approving their own journal entries.     

We have created a specific set of general ledger reports used to monitor journal entry sources, segregation of duties, and proper approvals.     

Remediation Actions for Revenue Processes 

We are optimizing our revenue accounting organization structure to improve our control environment including the establishment of a revenue quality assurance organization.     

We are implementing enhanced control procedures and additional controls over our revenue process including, but not limited to, system controls and specific transaction controls.     

We are implementing a document storage system for improved organization and evidence of review.     

We have expanded the invoice review control procedures to encompass the utilization of standardized invoice templates and contract review templates and we performed a comprehensive training program over these control procedures.

Table of Contents  

Remediation for Impairment 

We engaged a third party expert to assist in our review of the completeness and accuracy of our valuation methodology and will continue to apply the enhancements in our valuation models on a going forward basis.     

We assessed, developed and are in the process of implementing specific guidance and procedures for the expected level of reviews to be performed in connection with valuation models that we use for impairment testing, including consideration of the data and assumptions used in these models.     

These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.  

We are designing and implementing the measures described above with the goal of remediation of the control deficiencies we have identified and strengthening our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures described above. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Outside of the enhancements listed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Following is the detail of the issuer purchases made during the quarter ended September 30, 2016: 

(1) 

In November 2001, our Board of Directors ( Board ) authorized a stock repurchase program with the objective of increasing stockholder returns. The Board periodically authorizes additional increases to the program. The most recent Board authorization to purchase additional common stock occurred in June 2016, whereby the Board increased the program allowance by $25.0 million. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2016, the Board has authorized the repurchase of shares up to a total value of $712.3 million, of which we have purchased 44.8 million shares on the open market for $700.0 million. As of September 30, 2016 the remaining amount authorized for repurchases under the program was approximately $12.3  million. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date. On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase allowance of $25 million.

Charles "Keith" Gallacher 

5936 Shady Oaks Drive 

Frisco, Texas 75034 

Dear Keith: 

As you know,  TeleTech  Services  Corporation  ("TeleTech")  and  you have  made  a  mutual  decision  to terminate your employment  effective August  31, 2016 ("Effective Date").  The purpose of this separation agreement and release of claims document (the "Letter Agreement") is to set forth the mutual rights and entitlements between you and TeleTech in connection with your termination of employment.   This Letter Agreement shall be interpreted in connection with that certain employment agreement that you executed with TeleTech as of June 3, 2013 ("Gallacher Employment Agreement") and to the extent any provisions of the Gallacher Employment Agreement and this Letter Agreement conflict, the terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement shall control. 

1.      Termination by Mutual Agreement  .  Your employment with TeleTech as TeleTech Executive Vice 

President for Global Markets and Industries ("GMI") will terminate effective the Effective Date. 

2.      Financial Terms of Separation. 

(a)    Enhanced Severance.      While the Gallacher Employment Agreement provides for a severance 

payment  in the amount  of one year's base salary (less all applicable withholdings) as provided in Section 8(b) of the Gallacher Employment Agreement, in the best interest of the business and as an additional compensation  for your obligations further outlined in this Letter Agreement, TeleTech will pay  you  the  total severance  in  the  amount  of    $500,000   (five  hundred  thousand  dollars) less applicable withholdings  (the "Enhanced Severance Payment"). The severance  amount due will be adjusted  by  amounts,  if  any,  that  are  due  from  you  to  TeleTech  as  of  Effective  Date.  This enhanced   severance  decision  was  discretionary  on  the  part  of  TeleTech  and  is  expressly conditioned on you agreeing to the terms and conditions as outlined in this Letter Agreement. The Enhanced Severance Payment shall be paid as provided in Paragraph 6 of this Letter Agreement. 

(b)     Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs.     As otherwise provided in your TeleTech Holdings, Inc. Restricted 

Stock Unit Agreements of June 7, 2013, July 1,  2014, January 2, 2015, July 1, 2015, and July 1, 

2016 ("All RSU Agreements"), all RSUs that you currently hold and which are yet unvested as of the 

Effective Date shall forfeit. 

(c)       Health   Wellness Benefits.    In addition to the Enhanced Severance Payment, if you elect to purchase COBRA  coverage  to cover  your and your family s  medical,  vision and dental benefits (collectively  "Benefits"),  TeleTech  shall  pay to  you for 9  (nine)  months  after the Effective Date ("Benefits Enhancement"),  the amount  equivalent  to TeleTech's  portion of  cost of Benefits, less legally  required deduction  and withholdings, if any.   The Benefits Enhancement will be paid monthly, in conjunction with the payment of the Enhanced Severance Payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the  monthly   Benefit  Enhancement  payments  shall  stop  as  soon  as  you  are employed by an organization that offers Benefits, as part of its compensation package, regardless of the cost of such Benefits to you.  You shall have the obligation to notify us as soon as you start such employment.

(c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no obligations hereunder shall commence until and unless this Letter Agreement is executed by you.  As provided in Paragraph 10 of this  Letter  Agreement, as required by  law,  you  may  take  up  to twenty-one  (21) days  to consider the  terms  of  this  Letter Agreement and  may  take  up to seven (7) days  to revoke  it thereafter.   No Enhanced Severance Payment nor  Benefits Enhancement  as  provided  herein,  shall start  until and  unless the  Letter Agreement is  executed  and   delivered   to   TeleTech  and   only   after   the   passage  of   the aforementioned revocation period. 

7.      Restrictive  Covenants.   All  prohibitions  outlined in  Paragraphs 7(d),  7(e),  7(f),  7(g),  and  7(h)  of this Letter  Agreement shall  collectively be  referred to  as  "Restrictive Covenants".    In consideration of TeleTech providing the Enhanced Severance Payment and Enhanced Benefits, you hereby agree to the following: 

(a)    Restricted Period.     These covenants and restrictions shall remain in effect for a period of time 

after the Effective Date  ("Restricted Period") as provided in each specific  Paragraph of this Letter Agreement.    The Restricted Period shall be extended by a period of time equal to any period during which you are in breach of any Restrictive Covenant set forth herein, including the period of any litigation for the enforcement of such Restrictive Covenant. 

(b)    Restricted Area.      You acknowledge that the business and enterprise of TeleTech and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the "TeleTech Group") is intended to be and is global.  You further   agree   that your   role  as  a  TeleTech  Executive Vice   President  and a  member of  the company's Executive Committee, your  activities  in  competition with  TeleTech  anywhere  in  the world   in  violation of  the  Restrictive  Covenants contained  herein would unfairly  damage  the TeleTech  group of  companies  and  its  legitimate  business  interests.   Therefore, the Restrictive Covenants contained in this  Letter  Agreement shall  apply  and be effective  throughout  the world (the "Restricted Area"). 

(c)     Capacity and Knowledge of  the  Executive  for   Restrictive  Covenants.      For  purposes of  the Restrictive  Covenants, you  agree  not  to engage in  any  of  the prohibited  or  restricted activities directly or  indirectly, individually or  as  an  employee, officer,  director, independent contractor, consultant, or agent, or as a venturer, partner, member, shareholder, or other  beneficial holder  of any interest in any  entity  or organization.  The phrase "to your knowledge" shall mean your actual knowledge and/or information available to you upon reasonable inquiry. 

(d)    Covenant Against Competition.        Except  as  further  clarified  in  Paragraph  7(e) for  a  fifteen (15) months Restricted Period  ending  on December 1, 2017 and within  the Restricted  Area  , you agree not to work  or otherwise contribute your knowledge, directly  or indirectly, in whole or in part, as an employee,  officer,  owner,  manager,  advisor,   consultant,  agent,   partner,  director,  significant 

Exhibit 10.1 

Charles "Keith" Gallacher 

Separation Agreement and Release of Claims Letter 

shareholder (i.e. a shareholder holding more than 5% of outstanding equity in any such entity), volunteer, intern or in any other similar capacity anywhere in  the world to a business entity engaged in the same or substantially similar business as TeleTech group of companies, including entities engaged in the full life cycle of customer strategy, analytics-driven, technology-enabled customer engagement management solutions from customer engagement strategy consulting, to technology and analytics  driven customer acquisition, to technology solution development and integration, to business process outsourcing customer care (collectively, "TeleTech Business"). 

(e)    Competition Consent  . For the avoidance of doubt, even if it would be reasonable for TeleTech to do so (given the amount of Enhanced Severance we are providing under this Letter Agreement)  it is not the intent of TeleTech to prevent you from seeking and securing gainful employment during the Restricted Period.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 7(d) above, therefore, in business areas   other than business process outsourcing customer care  , TeleTech is willing to entertain waiving the provisions of Paragraph 7(d) to allow you to accept employment with a company the business of which may overlap with TeleTech Business.   Such waiver may be provided in TeleTech's sole discretion, based on specific facts and circumstances that you would share with us, assuming TeleTech believes that a role and opportunity you are considering would not be harmful to TeleTech. 

(f)     Covenant Against Interference with Client Relations.       For a fifteen (15) months Restricted Period and within the Restricted Area  , you shall not interfere in any manner with any TeleTech relationships with its Clients or Prospective Clients, as defined below.  Your activities prohibited hereunder shall include, but are not limited to, any requests, suggestions, advice, recommendations, solicitations, or other actions or attempts to induce or influence a Client or a Prospective Client to 

(i)   withdraw from, curtail, or cease discussions with TeleTech about any Client or Prospective 

Client projects or business opportunities; or 

(ii)  cancel, breach, terminate, or otherwise fail to go forward with any contract or business relation with any of the TeleTech companies. 

As used herein the term "Client" shall include any person or entity to whom services have been provided by any of the TeleTech companies or with whom TeleTech established strategic marketing alliances as of the Effective Date.   The term "Prospective Client" shall include any person or entity to whom any TeleTech company has submitted a bid or proposal or directed tangible efforts to establish a Client relationship or strategic alliance during your employment with TeleTech as of the Effective Date. 

(g)    Covenant Against Interference with Employment Relations.       For a fifteen (15) months Restricted Period and within the Restricted Area  , you shall not interfere in any manner (directly or through others) with any TeleTech companies' relationships with any senior person who, to your knowledge, is employed by or otherwise is in the service of one or more of TeleTech companies during the Restricted Period.  Activities prohibited hereunder shall include, but are not limited to, your requests, suggestions, advice, recommendations, solicitations, or other actions or attempts to induce or influence a senior employee to leave employment or the service of any of TeleTech companies nor  identification  of  any  senior  persons  so  engaged  by  any  of  the  TeleTech companies as a target of recruiting activities by others. For purposes of this provision a 'senior person' or 'senior employee' shall exclusively refer to any participant in the 2016 Annual Restricted Stock Unit Grant. 

(h)    Notice to Future Employers.    In addition to the foregoing, during the fifteen (15) months Restricted Period, you agree to notify your future employer(s) that you separation of employment  from TeleTech is subject to these Restrictive Covenants against competition, against interference with client relationships, and against solicitation of TeleTech employees. 

(i)     Covenant Against Non-Disparagement  . You and TeleTech agree not to engage in negative discourse of any kind with respect to the each other and to refrain from making any comments (verbally or in writing) that disparage the other, including but not limited to TeleTech's business or management practices, your performance,  or any of each other's reputations, current  or former employees or financial status, or any of each other's business relationships. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  parties  understand  that  TeleTech  is  a large  company  with  more  than  40,000 employees   worldwide.   This non-disparagement  undertaking  on  the  part  of  TeleTech  is  an obligation  that relates  to the conduct  of the company's  CEO and senior management  team only (i.e. members  of TeleTech Executive Committee), as TeleTech cannot take on the responsibility of monitoring or overseeing  the private conduct  of its employees worldwide  with respect to any statements  they may make casually or intentionally  to whomever  about you.  And for clarification and  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt, it  will not be  a  violation  of  this Paragraph  for  either  you or TeleTech to make truthful statements,     under oath, as required by law or formal legal process. 

8.     No Admission of Wrongdoing:    By entering into this Letter Agreement, TeleTech  does not concede or admit

In the event you fail to return such property or records provided herein, you shall be liable to TeleTech for the value of all such property and records, and all reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred by TeleTech in recovering such property or records may be set-off against any payments due to you under this Agreement.  TeleTech  property  and  records  shall  include,  but  is  not  limited  to laptops,  tablets, printers, and other electronic devices, any TeleTech related document whether in written or electronic form and whether created by you or another person or entity.  Company equipment, files or business information of any kind, whether written, electronic, digital, or otherwise, shall not be copied, taken or otherwise used by you without the prior written consent of TeleTech, if any.

11.   Legal Review; Sophisticated Parties; No Changes.   Both parties acknowledge that this Letter 

Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between them.  Neither party has relied upon any representation nor did statement, written or oral, not set forth in this Letter Agreement.

The Notice of Dispute must state in reasonable detail the basis of each objection and the approximate amounts in dispute (the "  Disputed Items  "). Sellers will be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts set forth in the Draft Statement other than those specified in the Notice of Dispute. If (i) Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, does not notify Purchaser of any objection within such period of 30 days or (ii) Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, delivers a written acceptance notice in respect of the Draft Statement during such period of 30 days, then Sellers will be deemed to have accepted the Draft Statement as of the end of the 30-day review period or the date of receipt by Purchaser of such written acceptance notice, as applicable.

17 

documents, materials and other information, and make an oral presentation to the Third Party Auditors regarding the dispute. The Third Party Auditors will consider such additional documents, materials and other information and such oral presentations. Any such other documents, materials or other information will be copied to Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, and each of Purchaser and Kilmer will be entitled to attend any such oral presentation, and to reply thereto. Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, will jointly instruct the Third Party Auditors that: (i) they will act as an expert in accounting, and not as an arbitrator, to resolve the unresolved Disputed Items and amounts that were properly included in the Notice of Dispute in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) they will base their decision solely on the documents, materials, written submissions and oral presentations of Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, and not on independent review; and (iii) they may not assign a dollar value to any Disputed Item greater than the highest amount or less than the lowest amount claimed by Purchaser or Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, as applicable. The determination of the Third Party Auditors will be final and binding upon the Parties and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. The Draft Statement will be revised as necessary to reflect the Third Party Auditors' written decision, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Third Party Auditors in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against whom such determination is to be enforced. 

(f)           Final Determination  . Within five (5) Business Days following (i) the 30 day review period referred to in Section 2.5(d) during which no Notice of Dispute was given, (ii) the date of receipt by Purchaser of the written acceptance notice referred to in Section 2.5(d) or (iii) after the resolution of any dispute in accordance with Section 2.5(e), as the case may be, Purchaser will deliver to Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, an Adjustment Statement (the "  Final Statement  ") setting forth the final determination of the Net Debt (the "  Final Net Debt  ") and Net Working Capital (the "  Final Net Working Capital  "). The Final Statement will reflect the resolution of any Disputed Items in accordance with Section 2.5(e). The Final Statement will be final and binding upon the Parties upon delivery thereof and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. 

(g)           Final Net Debt Adjustment  . If the Final Net Debt is greater than the Estimated Net Debt, then Sellers will owe an amount equal to such excess to Purchaser. If the Final Net Debt is less than the Estimated Net Debt, then Purchaser will owe an amount equal to such shortfall to Sellers.  

(h)           Final Net Working Capital Adjustment  . If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Purchaser will owe an amount equal to such excess to Sellers. If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Sellers will owe an amount equal to such shortfall to Purchaser. 

18 

(i)           Adjustment to Purchase Price. 

(i)         If the Final Adjustment Amount is owed by Purchaser to Sellers, then, within three (3) Business Days of the Final Statement becoming final and binding in accordance with Section 2.5(f), (i) Purchaser shall pay such Final Adjustment Amount at the direction of Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Kilmer, and (ii) the Purchase Price shall be increased by such Final Adjustment Amount as set forth in Section 2.2(b).  

(ii)         If the Final Adjustment Amount is owed by Sellers to Purchaser, then, within three (3) Business Days of the Final Statement becoming final and binding in accordance with Section 2.5(f), (i) Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall pay such Final Adjustment Amount at the direction of Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Purchaser, and (ii) the Purchase Price shall be decreased by such Final Adjustment Amount as set forth in Section 2.2(b). 

(j)           Fees and Expenses  . Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will bear the fees and expenses of their respective legal, financial and other representatives in reviewing or settling the Draft Statement and the Final Statement, as the case may be. In the case of a dispute and the retention of Third Party Auditors to determine such dispute, the fees and expenses of the Third Party Auditors will be divided between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party. For illustration purposes only: (i) if the total amount of items in dispute is $100,000, and each Party is awarded $50,000 by the Third Party Auditors, then each Party will bear the Third Party Auditors' fees and expenses equally; or (ii) if the total amount of items in dispute is $100,000, and a Party is awarded $25,000 by the Third Party Auditors, then such Party will bear 75% and the other Party will bear 25% of the Third Party Auditors' fees and expenses. Sellers and Purchaser will each bear their own fees and expenses in presenting their respective cases to the Third Party Auditors. 

2.6  Withholding Rights. 

Each of Purchaser and Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to an Optionholder or Employee such amounts as Purchaser or Corporation and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, reasonably determine are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under any provision of applicable Law, including the Optionholder Withholding Amount and the Bonus Withholding Amount. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person in  

19 

respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and shall be paid by Purchaser or Corporation to the appropriate Governmental Entity directly or through Corporation's payroll agent.

(i)         will not, and will cause Corporation not to amend, repeal or modify any provision in Corporation's constating documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any current or former officer or director (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the Parties that the current and former officers and directors of Corporation continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent permitted by Law; and 

(ii)        will cause Corporation to (X) maintain the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by Corporation immediately prior to the Closing Date (provided that Corporation may substitute therefor policies with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of Corporation when compared to the insurance maintained by Corporation as of the Closing Date), and (Y) obtain, at Sellers expenses, as of the Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with respect to directors' and officers' liability with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), with  

46 

a claim period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of Corporation when compared to the insurance maintained by Corporation as of the Closing Date (the "  Tail Insurance  "). 

(b)         This Section 7.3 is intended for the benefit of, and is enforceable by, each current and former officer and director of Corporation and his heirs, executors and representatives, and is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. 

7.4        Tax Matters. 

(a)           Filing of Tax Returns  . From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause Corporation to duly and timely prepare, in a manner consistent with best practice unless otherwise required by Law, and file all Tax Returns required to be filed by Corporation for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall submit a draft of all such income Tax Returns of Corporation to Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, at least 45 days before the date on which such Tax Returns are required by Law to be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity. Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall have the right to ask Purchaser for reasonable changes to be made to any such draft Tax Return by communicating such changes in writing to Purchaser within 15 days of the receipt thereof. Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objection by Purchaser to Sellers' requested changes. If Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, cannot resolve any disputed item, then the item in question shall be resolved by an independent firm of chartered accountants mutually agreed by Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, and Purchaser (the "  Independent Auditor  "). The Parties agree that any change to a Tax Return requested by Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall be accepted provided that the Independent Auditor concludes that such change would reflect a reasonable filing position on the part of Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any interest, penalty or other Tax arising as a result of the late-filing of any Tax Return submitted to the Independent Auditor pursuant to this Section 7.4(a) shall be borne exclusively by Purchaser, who shall not be entitled to indemnification by Sellers in respect thereof under Section 6.2, to the extent that the Independent Auditor concludes that the requested changes reflect a reasonable filing position. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Auditor will be divided between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party. The determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding  

47 

upon Sellers and Purchaser and shall be made before the date on which such Tax Returns are required by Law to be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity. 

(b)           Cooperation  .    Sellers and Purchaser shall co-operate fully with each other and make available to each other in a timely fashion such data and other information as may reasonably be required for the preparation of any Tax Return of Corporation for a period ending on, before or including the Closing Date and shall preserve such data and other information until the expiration of any applicable limitation period under any applicable Tax Laws. 

(c)           Amending Tax Returns  . Purchaser shall not, and shall cause Corporation not to, file any amended Tax Return relating to Corporation (or otherwise change such Tax Returns) or make an election, designation or other filing with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods without the prior written consent of Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, unless required to do so by Law. Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objection by Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, to Purchaser's proposed amended Tax Return, election, designation or other Pre Closing Tax Period filing. If Purchaser and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, cannot resolve any objection or disputed item, then the item in question shall be resolved by the Independent Auditor, and the fees and disbursements of the Independent Auditor shall be will be divided between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may cause Corporation to make an election pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act in respect of its taxation years ending on the acquisition of control by Purchaser. 

(d)           Subsection 110(1.1) Election  . Purchaser will cause Corporation to file an election under subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act and otherwise comply with such provision in a timely manner in respect of the transfer of the Options by the Optionholders to Corporation and the payment by or on behalf of Corporation of the Optionholder Consideration. 

(e)           Audits  . Purchaser shall notify Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, upon receipt by Purchaser or Corporation of any Tax assessments which may affect the Tax liabilities of Corporation for which Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to Article 6, provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect the Purchaser Indemnified Persons' right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure impairs Sellers' ability to contest any such Tax liabilities or assessments that could affect the indemnification obligations of Sellers. Purchaser shall have the right to control any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax (a "  Tax Proceeding  ") and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, provided however that Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, shall be permitted to  

48 

be present at, and participate in, any such Tax Proceeding (including the preparation of any correspondence) at its expense to the extent that said Tax Proceeding may affect the Tax liabilities of Corporation for which Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to Article 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the prior written consent of Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall promptly notify Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, if it decides not to control the defense or settlement of any Tax Proceeding which may affect the Tax liabilities of Corporation for which Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to Article 6 and Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, thereupon shall be permitted to defend and settle such Tax Proceeding. 

(f)           Restrictive Covenant  .   The Parties agree that (i) no proceeds shall be received or receivable by any Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement as consideration for granting any covenant in any agreement referred to in Section Article 5(a)(v), and (ii) all such covenants are being granted to maintain or preserve the fair market value of the Purchased Shares. At the request of a Seller, the Parties shall make any election or amended election provided for under section 56.4 of the Tax Act in connection with the foregoing. Sellers shall be responsible for preparing and filing the election form, together with any other documents required to be filed with the election, within the prescribed time limits in order for the election to be valid. 

7.5        Further Assurances. 

Each Party upon the request of any other Party, whether at or after the Closing, will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be done, executed, acknowledged or delivered, all such further conveyances, transfers and other assurances as may be reasonably required to effectively transfer the Purchased Shares to Purchaser and carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Any element of a Party's address that is not specifically changed in a Notice will be assumed not to be changed. 

50 

8.2        Time of the Essence. 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement. The mere lapse of time in the performance of the terms of this Agreement by any Party will have the effect of putting such Party in default in accordance with Articles 1594 to 1600 of the   Civil Code of Qu bec  . 

8.3        Appointment of Agent. 

(a)         In order to administer efficiently the determination of certain matters under this Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably authorizes Kilmer to act as each such Seller's agent and mandatary (within the meaning of the   Civil Code of Qu bec  ) with respect to all matters under this Agreement, other than as contemplated in this Section 8.3. 

(b)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Kilmer has full power and authority to make all decisions and take all actions relating to Sellers' respective rights, obligations and remedies under this Agreement, including to receive and make payments, to receive and send notices (including notices of termination), to receive and deliver documents, to exercise, enforce or waive rights or conditions, to give releases and discharges, to seek indemnification on behalf of Sellers and to defend against indemnification claims of Purchaser Indemnified Persons. All decisions and actions taken by Kilmer are binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller has the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. 

(c)         Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement, Kilmer shall not have the authority to do anything on behalf any Seller (other than itself only) that will increase or might have the result of increasing the liability of any Seller hereunder or decreasing the Purchase Price payable to any Seller other than in respect of settling adjustments to the Purchase Price contemplated hereby.  

(d)         Purchaser is entitled to deal only with Kilmer in respect of all matters arising under this Agreement including to receive and make payments, to receive and send notices (including notices of termination), to receive and deliver documents, to exercise, enforce or waive rights or conditions, to give releases and discharges, to seek indemnification against Sellers or any one of them and to defend against indemnification claims of Sellers. 

(e)         All references in this Agreement to decisions and actions to be taken by Sellers or any one of them, as the case may be, are deemed taken by Sellers or any one of them, as the case may be, if such decisions or actions are taken by Kilmer. All references in this Agreement to decisions and actions to be taken by Purchaser and directed to Sellers or any one of them, as the case may be, are deemed directed to Sellers or any one of them, as the case may be, if such decisions or actions are directed by Purchaser to Kilmer. 

51 

(f)         In no event will Purchaser be held responsible or liable for the application or allocation of any monies paid to Kilmer by Purchaser, and Purchaser will be entitled to rely upon any notice provided to Purchaser by Kilmer or action taken by Kilmer acting within the scope of its authority. All monies received by Kilmer hereunder for the account of Sellers shall be held by Kilmer in trust for Sellers and, subject to Section 8.3(g), shall be paid to Sellers, to the extent entitled thereto hereunder or for the account of whom such monies are held, reasonably promptly upon receipt. 

(g)         Kilmer will establish an Expense Reserve Holdback to be deposited in an interest bearing account (or other interest-bearing instruments or deposits as selected by Kilmer, in its sole discretion). Kilmer will maintain the Expense Reserve Holdback for as long as it deems necessary or appropriate and, upon completion of performing its duties and functions under this Agreement, will pay to each Seller any remaining portion of the Expense Reserve Holdback in accordance with each such Seller's Pro Rata Share. 

(h)         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment, notice, receipt or delivery of documents, exercise, enforcement or waiver of rights or conditions, indemnification claim or indemnification or a principal defence will be ineffective by reason only of it having been made or given to or by a Seller, as the case may be, directly if each of Purchaser and such Seller consent by virtue of not objecting to such dealings without the intermediary of Kilmer. 

(i)         Kilmer shall, at the expense Sellers, be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as Kilmer shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its duties and performing its functions hereunder and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. Kilmer shall have no liability to any of Sellers for any actions taken by it in good faith in its capacity as agent (and any action done or omitted pursuant to advice of counsel, expert or other agent or consultant shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). Each Seller shall jointly (not solidarily) indemnify Kilmer and hold Kilmer harmless up to such Seller's Pro Rata Share against any Damages and shall reimburse Kilmer up to such Seller's Pro Rata Share for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of Kilmer and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of Kilmer's duties and functions hereunder, including each Seller's Pro Rata Share of the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel, expert or other agent or consultant retained by Kilmer in each case to the extent that the amount then held in the Expense Reserve Holdback is not sufficient for such purpose. 

8.4        Announcements and Public Disclosure. 

Unless required by Law or by a Governmental Entity, no press release, public statement or announcement or other public disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein may be made except with the prior written consent and joint approval of  

52 

Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, and Purchaser. Where the public disclosure is required by Law or by a Governmental Entity, the Party required to make the public disclosure will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of Purchaser or Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers, as the case may be, as to the form, nature and extent of the disclosure, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

8.5        Employee Information 

The Parties agree that (i) the Employee information disclosed to Purchaser was necessary for Purchaser's determination to enter into this Agreement and proceed with the transactions contemplated hereby and for the Parties to proceed with Closing, and (ii) such information relates solely to carrying on the Business and will only be used for those purposes for which it was initially collected from or in respect of such Employees. 

8.6        Third Party Beneficiaries. 

Except as provided in Section 7.3 and for the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the Sellers Indemnified Persons, the Parties intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the Parties. No Person, other than the Parties, the Persons listed in Section 7.3, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the Sellers Indemnified Persons, is entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or other forum. The Parties reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights at any time and in any way whatsoever, if any, granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is not a Party, without notice to or consent of that Person. 

8.7        Guarantee. 

Purchaser Guarantor, having taken cognizance of this Agreement, hereby intervenes to this Agreement for the purpose of (i) guaranteeing the timely performance and fulfillment by Purchaser of its payment obligations under this Agreement, including pursuant to Article 2 and Article 6, and (ii) agreeing that it will be solidarily (within the meaning of the   Civil Code of Qu bec  ) liable with Purchaser, waiving the benefit of division and discussion, with respect to its liabilities and obligations under this Agreement. The liabilities and obligations of Purchaser Guarantor are subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall not exceed any liability or obligation of Purchaser under this Agreement. Purchaser Guarantor is entitled to all rights, privileges and defences available to Purchaser with respect to any liability or obligation.  

8.8        Expenses. 

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will pay for its own fees and expenses incident to the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and therein.  

53 

8.9        Amendments. 

This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by written agreement signed by Purchaser, Purchaser Guarantor and Sellers.  

8.10        Waiver. 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party's failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right. 

8.11       Non-Merger. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants, representations and warranties will not merge on and will survive Closing and, notwithstanding such Closing, will continue in full force and effect. Closing will not prejudice any right of one Party against any other Party in respect of anything done or omitted under this Agreement or in respect of any right to damages or other remedies. 

8.12      Entire Agreement. 

This Agreement together with the agreements referred to herein and therein constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and   therein   and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. Except as set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise, among the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement and neither Party has relied or is relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. 

8.13       Successors and Assigns. 

This Agreement will become effective as of the Adjustment Time on the Closing Date and after that time will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, administrators, liquidators, executors, successors and permitted assigns. 

8.14       Assignment. 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this Agreement will be assignable or transferable by any Seller without the prior written consent of Purchaser or by Purchaser without the prior written consent of Kilmer, as agent for and on behalf of Sellers. Any purported assignment or transfer without such written consent will be null and void and of no effect; provided however that each of Purchaser and Sellers may assign, transfer or delegate, as  

54 

applicable, this Agreement or any of its rights, and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its Affiliates without prior written consent of the other parties, provided that any assignor and its Affiliate remain solidarily (within the meaning of the   Civil Code of Qu bec  ) bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement so assigned. 

8.15       Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal exists or is taken, that provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. 

8.16       Governing Law. 

(a)         This Agreement is governed by, and will be interpreted and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the Province of Qu bec and the federal Laws of Canada applicable therein.  

(b)         The Parties agree that the courts of the District of Montr al, Province of Qu bec, Canada, will have exclusive jurisdiction for the adjudication of any and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement (other than a dispute relating to the adjustment of the Purchase Price which will be resolved in accordance with Section 2.5) and waive any objections to the assertion or exercise of jurisdiction by such courts, including any objection based on forum non conveniens. 

8.17       Retention of Counsel 

It is acknowledged by each of the Parties hereto that Corporation has retained Stikeman Elliott LLP ("  SE  ") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing between Purchaser and Sellers, SE may represent Kilmer and the other Sellers in such dispute even though the interests of Sellers may be directly adverse to Purchaser or Corporation, and even though SE may have represented Corporation in a matter substantially related to such dispute. 

8.18       Counterparts. 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which is deemed to be an original, and such counterparts together constitute one and the same instrument.
