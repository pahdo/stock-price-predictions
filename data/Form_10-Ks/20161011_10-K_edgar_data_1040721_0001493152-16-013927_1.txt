ITEM
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.   

History   

Apolo
Gold   Energy Inc, (the  Company ) was incorporated in March 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Apolo
Gold Inc., for the purpose of financing and operating precious metals concessions. In May 2005, the Company amended its articles
of incorporation to change the name of the Company from Apolo Gold Inc. to Apolo Gold   Energy Inc.  

After
incorporation in 1997 the Company focused on precious metals opportunities in Latin and South America. Shortly thereafter the
Company formed a subsidiary, Compania Minera Apologold, C.A. a corporation, and on May 18, 1999 the Venezuela subsidiary entered
into an agreement with Empresa Proyectos Mineros Goldma, C.A. in Caracas Venezuela, to acquire the diamond and gold mining concession
in Southern Venezuela known as Codsa 13, located in the Gran Sabana Autonomous Municipality, State of Bolivar, Venezuela. This
project was subsequently cancelled in August 2001 because of poor testing results. The subsidiary company in Venezuela has been
dormant since 2001 and will not be reactivated.  

On
April 16, 2002, the Company executed an agreement with Pt. Metro Astatama, of Jakarta, Indonesia, for the mining rights to a property
known as Nepal Umbar Picung ( NUP ), which is located west of Bandar Lampung, on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.
NUP has a KP, Number KW. 098PP325, which is a mineral tenement license for both Exploration and Exploitation. All KP s must
be held by an Indonesian entity.  

The
 NUP  is 733.9 hectares in size and Apolo had an 80% interest. These claims are owned privately by citizens of Indonesia
and are not crown granted claims. Apolo was entitled to recover all of its development costs on the  NUP  including
property payments before the partner with 20% can participate.  

The
total purchase price for  NUP  was $375,000, of which payments amounting to $250,000 had been made. After various
exploration programs including different drilling programs failed to yield sufficient positive results, the Company discussed
various options with the property owner and decided to terminate its agreement with the NUP property and return all exploration
rights to the property owners.  

On
December 11, 2013, the Company acquired 70% interest in three gold exploration claims located in China s Xinjiang Province
from Yinfu Gold Corp. ( Yinfu ). The Company issued six million shares of restricted common stocks for the claims.  

On
December 23, 2013, the Company acquired 24% equity interest in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd. ( Everenergy ).
The consideration was settled by the issuance of eight-million restricted common stocks at a deemed price of $0.375 per share,
plus $1-million in cash. Additionally, on February 19, 2014, the Company acquired an additional 29% equity interest in Everenergy.
The consideration was settled with the issuance of 11-million restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.  

On
September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy and had requested return of the $1-million payment
and all the shares. The 11-million shares issued were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014. The remaining 8-million shares
issued are in the process of cancellation and the $1 million paid for the acquisition was written off as investment loss.  

On
January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to terminate the acquisition of the 70% interest in the three
gold exploration claims in the PRC. On February 3, 2015, all six million shares of restricted common stock had been returned by
the wholly owned subsidiary of Yinfu and cancelled by the Company.  

On
February 13, 2015, the Company disposed its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold  
Energy Asia Limited) to (i) Mr. (Tommy) Tsap Wai Ping, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and director of the Company,
who acquired 50% equity interest, (ii) Mr. Kelvin Chak Wai Man, a relative of the CEO of the Company, who acquired 40% equity
interest, and (iii) China Yi Gao Gold Trader Co., Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, which acquired the remaining 10%
equity interest, for a consideration of $100.  

On
June 18, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its
name from Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. to Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc.  

On
December 1, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of 200,000 shares of restricted common stock at
$0.08 per share for the rendering of consulting services of $16,000 in a service period of twelve months commencing from December
2015. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company amortized $9,333 to the operations using the straight-line method. As of June
30, 2016, no shares were issued and the $16,000 for this obligation was recorded as stock payable.  

The
Company continues to pursue opportunities in the natural resource industry and will consider the acquisition of any other business
opportunity in order to enhance value for our shareholders.  

Government
Regulation  

The
Company was aware of environmental requirements in the operation of a concession. The Company is comfortable with the requirements
and regulations and will abide by them.  

ITEM
1A. Risk Factors  

1. The
Company has no record of earnings. It is also subject to all the risks inherent in a developing business enterprise including
lack of cash flow, and no assurance of recovery of precious metals.  

2. The
Company s success and possible growth will depend on its ability to develop or acquire new business operations. It continues
to explore opportunities but has yet to secure an opportunity that is acceptable.  

3. Liquidity
and need for additional financing is a concern for the Company. At the present time, the Company does not have sufficient cash
to finance its operations. The Company is dependent on the ability of its management team to obtain the necessary working capital
to operate successfully. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital as required or if the
capital is available, to obtain it on terms favorable to the Company. The Company may suffer from a lack of liquidity in the future
that could impair its production efforts and adversely affect its results of operations.  

4. Competition
is more in the area of ability to sell at world prices that the Company cannot control, and the Company competes for access to
the world markets with its products.  

5. The
Company is wholly dependent at the present upon the personal efforts and abilities of its Officers and Directors, who exercise
control over the day-to-day affairs of the Company.  

6. There
are currently 30,072,118 common shares outstanding at September 28, 2016 out of a total authorized capital of 300,000,000 shares.
This is after giving effect of the cancellation issuance of 11,000,000 common shares for the acquisition of 29% interest in Everenergy;
cancellation issuance of 6,000,000 common shares for the three mineral properties; issuance of 1,040,000 common shares as debt
settlement; issuance of 6,400,000 common shares as consulting services provided. The Company continues to pursue the return of
8,000,000 shares from the cancelled acquisition of the additional 24% interest in Everenergy. The Board of Directors has the power
to issue such shares, subject to Shareholder approval, in some instances.  

7.
There are no dividends anticipated by the Company.

The
Company s office is at 20/F, EIB Centre, 40-44 Bonham Strand, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong. Its telephone number is 852-2516-5060.

ITEM
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations/Plan of Operation General Overview   

Apolo
Gold   Energy Inc. ( Company ) was incorporated in March 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Its objective
was to pursue mineral properties in South America, Central America, North America and Asia. The Company incorporated a subsidiary
- Compania Minera Apologold, C.A in Venezuela to develop a gold/diamond mining concession in Southeastern Venezuela. Project was
terminated in August 2001, due to poor testing results and the property abandoned. This subsidiary company has been inactive since
2001 and will not be reactivated.  

On
April 16, 2002, the Company announced the acquisition of the mining rights to a property known as the Napal Gold Property, ( NUP ).
This property is located 48 km south-west of Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia. The property consisted of 733.9 hectares and
possessed a Production Permit (a KP) # KW. 098PP325.  

The
terms of the Napal Gold Property called for a total payment of $375,000 US over a six-year period of which a total of $250,000
have been made to date. Company paid $250,000 over the past 5 years and subsequent to the year ending June 30, 2008 the Company
terminated its agreement on the NUP property and returned all exploration rights to the owner.  

On

from Yinfu Gold Corp. ( Yinfu ). The Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock for the claims at
$0.20 per share for the consideration of $1,200,000. On January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to
terminate the acquisition at the current market value of $0.10 per share and therefore an investment loss of $600,000 was resulted.

was settled with the issuance of 11,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.  

On
September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy at the current market value of $0.12 per share and
requested the return of $1,000,000 cash payment. The 11,000,000 shares were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014 and the
remaining 8,000,000 shares are to be cancelled. For the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company could not recover the $1,000,000
cash payment and therefore a total investment loss of $6,670,000 was resulted.  

On
February 13, 2015, the Company disposed its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold  
Energy Asia Limited) to (i) Mr. Tommy Tsap Wai Ping, who acquired 50% equity interest. Mr. Tsap Wai Ping became the Chief Executive
Officer ( CEO ) and director of the Company on December 1, 2015. (ii) Mr. Kelvin Chak Wai Man, the former president,
CEO and director of the Company and a relative of the current CEO of the Company, acquired 40% equity interest, and (iii) China

consideration of $100.  

On
June 4, 2015, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.10 per share for the rendering of business
and strategic consulting services of $600,000 in a service period of twelve months commencing from June 2015. For the years ended

name from Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. to Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc.

an increase of $359,606. Among the consulting and professional fees, approximately $559,333 and $122,300 were settled by stock
based compensation for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

There
were no additional or extraordinary expenses incurred in the current year ending June 30, 2016 as the Company focused its efforts
in seeking out a resource project that would be beneficial to shareholders.  

The
Company continues to carefully control its expenses, and intends to seek additional financing both for potential business opportunities
it may develop. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its attempts to raise additional capital.  

The
Company has no employees in its head office at the present time other than its Officers and Directors, and engages personnel through
consulting agreements where necessary as well as outside attorneys, accountants and technical consultants.  

Cash

REPORT
OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing
reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and
providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material
effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements
would be prevented or detected.  

In
connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, Management on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting is under the supervision of the principal executive officer who is the chief executive officer of the
Company. Under his direction, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as required
by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer concluded that Disclosures
Controls and Procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016. Due to limited financial resources available, there is a lack
of segregation of duties in financial reporting although the Principal Executive Officer, who also serves as Principal Financial
Officer, is an experienced financial executive and professional with professional accreditation.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders,  

  Wincash
Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc.  

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. (the  Company ) as of June 30,
2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the
years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial losses, which raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to their planned financing and other matters are also described
in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.  ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS  

Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. ( the
Company ) was incorporated in March of 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada primarily for the purpose of acquiring
and developing mineral properties. 

On September 17, 2014, the Company terminated
the Asset Sale   Purchase Agreements with Mr. Tang and Mr. Hu for the acquisition of 24% and 29% equity interest and assets
in Everenergy, respectively due to neither Mr. Tang, Mr. Hu or Everenergy had complied various terms and conditions of the Asset
Sale   Purchase Agreement. On the same day, the Board of Directors approved the cancellation of the total 19,000,000 shares
of restricted common stock at the current market value of $0.12 per share. On October 21, 2014, 11,000,000 shares were returned
and effectively cancelled and the Company continues to pursue the return and cancellation of the remaining 8,000,000 shares. For
the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company could not recover the $1,000,000 cash payment and a total investment loss of $6,670,000
was resulted. 

On February 13, 2015, the Company disposed
its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold   Energy Asia Limited) to Mr. Tommy Tsap,
the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and director of the Company, Mr. Tsap Wai Ping, the brother of the CEO and China
Yi Gao Gold Trader Co., Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for a consideration of $100. For the year ended June, 30,
2015, there was no gain or loss recognized on the disposal of a subsidiary. 

On June 18, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment
to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. to Wincash
Apolo Gold   Energy, Inc. 

The Company will continue to anticipate potential
mineral property exploration and other energy related investments. As of June 30, 2016, the Company does not hold any mineral
property exploration claims. 

2. GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company suffered
the accumulated deficits of $16,050,826 from prior years and suffered from a working capital deficit of $75,460. The continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing financial support from its stockholders or external financing.
Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company s obligations as
they become due. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet its obligations. 

These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of presentation  

The accompanying financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ). 

Use of estimates  

Management uses estimates and assumptions
in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the reported revenue
and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments. 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company adopts FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC Topic 718 ) using the fair value method.
Under ASC Topic 718, the stock-based compensation is measured using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing model on the date of grant
under the modified prospective method. The fair value of stock-based compensation that are expected to vest are recognized using
the straight-line method over the requisite service period. 

Income taxes  

Income taxes are determined in accordance
with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC Topic 740 ). Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for
how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when
it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially
and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

Net loss per share  

The Company calculates net loss per share
in accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share.   Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar
to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

Related parties  

Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they
are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair value of financial instruments  

The carrying value of the Company s
financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, other payables and accrued liabilities, and amount due to a director
approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The Company also follows the guidance of the
ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820-10 ), with respect to financial
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1: Observable
    inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;   

Level 2: Inputs,
    other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level 3: Unobservable
    inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.   

Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates. 

Foreign currency translation  

Transactions denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into
the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are
recorded in the statement of operations. 

The reporting currency of the Company is United
States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

FASB issues various Accounting Standards Updates
relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10,Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) - Elimination of Certain Financial
Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates
the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected adoption of
this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations and cash flows since
inception. 

The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected
to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2016 (the
 Evaluation Date ). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are those
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe
that our financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 fairly present our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects. 

Management s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act, for the Company. 

Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management recognizes that there are inherent
limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions
or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. 

A material weakness is a significant deficiency,
or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting, as of the Evaluation Date, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the Evaluation Date. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of Evaluation Date and identified the following material weaknesses: 

Inadequate Segregation
of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. 

Insufficient Written Policies   Procedures:
 We have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. 

Inadequate Financial Statement
Closing Process:  We have an inadequate financial statement closing process. 

Lack of Audit Committee:  The lack of
a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors, resulting
in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 

Management is committed to improving its internal
controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with
accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which
will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) prepare and implement sufficient
written policies and checklists for financial reporting and closing processes and (4) may consider appointing outside directors
and audit committee members in the future. 

Management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public
accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which
could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report
was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us
to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in internal control
over financial reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the last quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or that are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the effectiveness
of controls and procedures  

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that the our controls and procedures will prevent all potential errors
or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met.

Committees: Meetings
of the Board 

The Company does not have a separate Compensation
Committee, Audit Committee or Nominating Committee. These functions are done by the Board of Directors meeting as a whole. The
Company s Board of Directors held both in person meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30,2016 and meetings by were
conducted by telephone. All corporate actions by the Board of Directors were either consented to in writing by all Directors or
were agreed to unanimously at a meeting where proper notice had been given and a quorum was present. 

Audit Committee 

The board of directors has not established
an audit committee. The functions of the audit committee are currently performed by the entire board of directors. The Company
is under no legal obligation to establish an audit committee and has elected not to do so at this time so as to avoid the time
and expense of identifying independent directors willing to serve on the audit committee. The Company may establish an audit committee
in the future if the board determines it to be advisable or we are otherwise required to do so by applicable law, rule or regulation. 

As the board of directors does not have an
audit committee, it therefore has no  audit committee financial expert  within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation
S-B. except its chief financial officer. In general, an  audit committee financial expert  is an individual member
of the audit committee who: 

understands
    generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements,   

is
    able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves,   

has
    experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our
    financial statements,   

understands
    internal controls over financial reporting, and   

understands
    audit committee functions.   

Board of Directors Independence 

One of the Company s directors is  independent 
within the meaning of definitions established by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any self-regulatory organization. This
director is Tsap Wai, Ping (Tommy Tsap). The Company is not currently subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all
or any portion of its board of directors include  independent  directors. 

Director Nominees 

The Company does not have a nominating committee.
The board of directors, sitting as a board, selects those individuals to stand for election as members of our board. Since the
board of directors does not include a majority of independent directors, the decision of the board as to director nominees is
made by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. The board will consider candidates for directors proposed
by security holders, although no formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Until otherwise determined, not
less than 90 days prior to the next annual board of directors  meeting at which the slate of board nominees is adopted,
the board accepts written submissions that include the name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee, along with
a brief statement of the candidate s qualifications to serve as a director and a statement of why the shareholder submitting
the name of the proposed nominee believes that the nomination would be in the best interests of shareholders. If the proposed
nominee is not the security holder submitting the name of the candidate, a letter from the candidate agreeing to the submission
of his or her name for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a resume
supporting the nominee s qualifications to serve on the board of directors, as well as a list of references. 

The board identifies director nominees through
a combination of referrals, including by management, existing board members and security holders, where warranted. Once a candidate
has been identified the board reviews the individual s experience and background, and may discuss the proposed nominee with
the source of the recommendation. If the board believes it to be appropriate, board members may meet with the proposed nominee
before making a final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of management s slate of director
nominees submitted for shareholders for election to the board. 

Among the factors that the board considers
when evaluating proposed nominees are their experience in the information technology industry, knowledge of and experience with
and knowledge of and experience in business matters, finance, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The board may request
additional information from the candidate prior to reaching a determination. The board is under no obligation to formally respond
to all recommendations, although as a matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so. 

Security Holder Communications with our
Board of Directors 

The Company provides an informal process for
security holders to send communications to our board of directors. Security holders who wish to contact the board of directors
or any of its members may do so by writing to Wincash Apolo Gold   Energy Inc., at 20/F, EIB Centre, 40-44 Bonham Strand,
Sheung Wan, Hong Kong. 

Correspondence directed to an individual board
member is referred, unopened, to that member. Correspondence not directed to a particular board member is referred, unopened,
to the President and CEO. 

Code of Ethics 

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
Securities and Exchange Commission s related rules, the Company is required to disclose whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the Company s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
or controller or persons performing similar functions. The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to its chief executive

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

The following Compensation Discussion and
Analysis (CD A) provides information on the compensation programs established for our  Named Executive Officers 
during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. All information provided herein should be read in conjunction with the tables provided
below. 

Our Board of Directors is responsible for
establishing, implementing and monitoring the policies governing compensation for our executives. Currently our Board does not
have a compensation committee. Our officers are members of our Board of Directors and are able to vote on matters of compensation.
We are not currently under any legal obligation to establish a compensation committee and have elected not to do so at this time.
In the future, we may establish a compensation committee if the Board determines it to be advisable or we are otherwise required
to do so by applicable law, rule or regulation. During the year ended June 30, 2016 our Board did not employ any outside consultants
to assist in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to executive compensation, although we have access to general executive
compensation information regarding both local and national industry compensation practices. In future periods we may participate
in regional and national surveys that benchmark executive compensation by peer group factors such as company size, annual revenues,
market capitalization and geographical location. 

The executive employment market in general
is very competitive due to the number of companies with whom we compete to attract and retain executive and other staff with the
requisite skills and experience to carry out our strategy and to maintain compliance with multiple Federal and State regulatory
agencies. Many of these companies have significantly greater economic resources than our own. Our Board has recognized that our
compensation packages must be able to attract and retain highly talented individuals that are committed to our goals and objectives,
without at this time paying cash salaries that are competitive with some of our peers with greater economic resources. Our compensation
structure is weighted towards equity compensation in the form of options to acquire common stock, which the Board believes motivates
and encourages executives to pursue strategic opportunities while managing the risks involved in our current business stage, and
aligns compensation incentives with value creation for our shareholders. 

Components of Our Executive Compensation
Program 

Our executive compensation program incorporates
components we believe are necessary in order for the Company to provide a competitive compensation package relative to our peers
and to provide an appropriate mix between short-term and long-term cash and non-cash compensation. Elements of our executive compensation
are listed below: 

Base
    Salary   

Stock
    Awards   

Other
    benefits available to all employees   

Items
    specific to our President and Chief Executive Officer per an employment agreement   

Base Salary: At present we do not have a
salary structure for employees and executives is based on skill set, knowledge and responsibilities. Base salaries may be
established as necessary. During the year ended June 30, 2016 none of our Named Executive Officers received a salary
increase. 

Stock Awards: A portion of compensation paid
to our executives is equity based. We believe equity compensation helps align the interests of our executives with the interests
of our shareholders. In that regard, our executives  compensation is subject to downside risk in the event that our common
stock price decreases. In addition, we believe stock awards provide incentives to aid in the retention of key executives. 

Other Benefits: Our Executive Officers and
employees receive no other benefits.

Management
