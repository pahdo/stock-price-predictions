NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS  

The United States Diesel-Heating Oil Fund,
LP ( UHN ), was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 13, 2007. UHN
is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership shares ( shares ) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca,
Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). Prior to November 25, 2008, UHN s shares traded on the American Stock Exchange
(the  AMEX ). UHN will continue in perpetuity, unless terminated sooner upon the occurrence of one or more events
as described in its Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended March 1, 2013 (the  LP
Agreement ). The investment objective of UHN is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares  per share
net asset value ( NAV ) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of heating oil (also known
as No. 2 fuel oil) for delivery to the New York harbor, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract
for heating oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the  NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire,
except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contract will be the next month
contract to expire (the  Benchmark Futures Contract ),plus interest earned on UHN s collateral holdings, less
UHN s expenses. It is not the intent of UHN to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar
terms, the spot price of heating oil or any particular futures contract based on heating oil. It is not the intent of UHN to be
operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract
as measured over a time period greater than one day. United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), the general partner
of UHN, believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures
Contracts (as defined below) and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments (as defined below). UHN accomplishes its objective
through investments in futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, crude oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels
that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange ( ICE Futures ) or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively,
 Futures Contracts ) and other diesel-heating oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts,
forward contracts for diesel-heating oil and over-the-counter ( OTC ) transactions that are based on the price of diesel-heating
oil, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively,  Other
Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments ). As of September 30, 2016, UHN held 84 Futures Contracts for heating oil traded
on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts for heating oil on the ICE Futures. 

UHN commenced investment operations on April
9, 2008 and has a fiscal year ending on December 31. USCF is responsible for the management of UHN. USCF is a member
of the National Futures Association (the  NFA ) and became a commodity pool operator registered with
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ) effective December 1, 2005 and a swaps firm on August 8,
2013. USCF is also the general partner of the United States Oil Fund, LP ( USO ), the United States Natural Gas
Fund, LP ( UNG ), the United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP ( USL ) and the United States Gasoline Fund,
LP ( UGA ), which listed their limited partnership shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbols  USO 
on April 10, 2006,  UNG  on April 18, 2007,  USL  on December 6, 2007 and  UGA 
on February 26, 2008, respectively. As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, each of USO s,
UNG s, USL s and UGA s shares commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008. USCF is also
the general partner of the United States Short Oil Fund, LP ( DNO ), the United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP
( UNL ) and the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP ( BNO ), which listed their limited partnership shares
on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbols  DNO  on September 24, 2009,  UNL  on November 18,
2009 and  BNO  on June 2, 2010, respectively. USCF is also the sponsor of the United States Commodity Index
Fund ( USCI ), the United States Copper Index Fund ( CPER ), the United States Agriculture Index Fund ( USAG )
and the USCF Canadian Crude Oil Index Fund ( UCCO ), each a series of the United States Commodity Index Funds Trust.
USCI, CPER, and USAG listed their shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol  USCI  on August 10, 2010,  CPER 
on November 15, 2011 and  USAG  on April 13, 2012, respectively. UCCO is currently in registration. 

All funds listed previously, other than UCCO,
are referred to collectively herein as the  Related Public Funds.  

UHN issues shares to certain authorized purchasers
( Authorized Participants ) by offering baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets ) through
ALPS Distributors, Inc., as the marketing agent (the  Marketing Agent ). The purchase price for a Creation Basket is
based upon the NAV of a share calculated shortly after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on the day the
order to create the basket is properly received. 

In addition, Authorized Participants pay UHN
a $350 fee for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more baskets ( Redemption Baskets ),
consisting of 50,000 shares. Shares may be purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange in smaller increments
than a Creation Basket or Redemption Basket. Shares purchased or sold on a nationally recognized securities exchange are not purchased
or sold at the per share NAV of UHN but rather at market prices quoted on such exchange. 

In April 2008, UHN initially registered 10,000,000
shares on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). On April 9, 2008, UHN listed
its shares on the AMEX under the ticker symbol  UHN  and switched to trading on the NYSE Arca under the same ticker
symbol on November 25, 2008. On that day, UHN established its  initial per share NAV by setting the price at $50.00
and issued 200,000 shares in exchange for $10,000,000. UHN also commenced investment operations on April 9, 2008 by purchasing Futures
Contracts traded on the NYMEX based on heating oil. As of September 30, 2016, UHN had registered a total of 60,000,000
shares. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and, therefore, do not include
all information and footnote disclosure required under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United
States of America. The financial information included herein is unaudited; however, such financial information reflects all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of USCF, necessary for the fair presentation of the
condensed financial statements for the interim period. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation  

The financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with GAAP as detailed in the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification. UHN is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB Topic 946. 

Revenue Recognition  

Commodity futures contracts, forward contracts,
physical commodities, and related options are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified
cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are reflected in the condensed statements of
financial condition and represent the difference between the original contract amount and the market value (as determined by exchange
settlement prices for futures contracts and related options and cash dealer prices at a predetermined time for forward contracts,
physical commodities, and their related options) as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the condensed
financial statements. Changes in the unrealized gains or losses between periods are reflected in the condensed statements
of operations. UHN earns income on funds held at the custodian or futures commission merchant ( FCM ) at prevailing
market rates earned on such investments. 

Brokerage Commissions  

Brokerage commissions on all open commodity
futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis. 

Income Taxes  

UHN is not subject to federal income taxes;
each partner reports his/her allocable share of income, gain, loss deductions or credits on his/her own income tax return. 

In accordance with GAAP, UHN is required to
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including
resolution of any tax related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. UHN files an
income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and may file income tax returns in various U.S. states. UHN is not subject
to income tax return examinations by major taxing authorities for years before 2013. The tax benefit recognized is measured
as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. De-recognition
of a tax benefit previously recognized results in UHN recording a tax liability that reduces net assets. However, UHN s conclusions
regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going
analysis of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. UHN recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized
tax benefits and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax fees payable, if assessed. No interest expense
or penalties have been recognized as of and for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

Creations and Redemptions  

Authorized Participants may purchase Creation
Baskets or redeem Redemption Baskets only in blocks of 50,000 shares at a price equal to the NAV of the shares calculated shortly
after the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on the day the order is placed. 

UHN receives or pays the proceeds from shares
sold or redeemed within three business days after the trade date of the purchase or redemption. The amounts due from Authorized
Participants are reflected in UHN s condensed statements of financial condition as receivable for shares sold, and amounts
payable to Authorized Participants upon redemption are reflected as payable for shares redeemed. 

Authorized Participants pay UHN a transaction
fee of $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. 

Partnership Capital and Allocation of Partnership
Income and Losses  

Profit or loss shall be allocated among the
partners of UHN in proportion to the number of shares each partner holds as of the close of each month. USCF may revise, alter
or otherwise modify this method of allocation as described in the LP Agreement. 

Calculation of Per Share Net Asset Value
( NAV )  

UHN s per share NAV is calculated on
each NYSE Arca trading day by taking the current market value of its total assets, subtracting any liabilities and dividing that
amount by the total number of shares outstanding. UHN uses the closing price for the contracts on the relevant exchange on that
day to determine the value of contracts held on such exchange. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share  

Net income (loss) per share is the difference
between the per share NAV at the beginning of each period and at the end of each period. The weighted average number
of shares outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average share. The weighted
average shares are equal to the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period, adjusted proportionately for shares added
and redeemed based on the amount of time the shares were outstanding during such period. There were no shares held by USCF at September
30, 2016. 

Offering Costs  

Offering costs incurred in connection with
the registration of additional shares after the initial registration of shares are borne by UHN. These costs include registration
fees paid to regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated with such offerings. These costs
are accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter
period if warranted. 

Cash Equivalents  

Cash equivalents include money market funds
and overnight deposits or time deposits with original maturity dates of six months or less. 

Reclassification  

Certain amounts in the accompanying condensed
financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of condensed financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires USCF to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts
of the revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

NOTE 3   FEES PAID BY THE FUND AND
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

USCF Management Fee  

Under the LP Agreement, USCF is responsible
for investing the assets of UHN in accordance with the objectives and policies of UHN. In addition, USCF has arranged for one or
more third parties to provide administrative, custody, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to UHN. For these
services, UHN is contractually obligated to pay USCF a fee, which is paid monthly, equal to 0.60% per annum of average daily
total net assets. 

Ongoing Registration Fees and Other Offering
Expenses  

UHN pays all costs and expenses associated
with the ongoing registration of its shares subsequent to the initial offering. These costs include registration or other fees
paid to regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses
associated with such offer and sale. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, UHN incurred $5,480 and $5,460, respectively,
in registration fees and other offering expenses. 

Independent Directors and Officers Expenses  

UHN is responsible for paying its portion of
the directors  and officers  liability insurance for UHN and the Related Public Funds and the fees and expenses of
the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of UHN and the Related Public Funds. UHN shares the fees and
expenses on a pro rata basis with each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each Related Public
Fund computed on a daily basis. These fees and expenses for the year ending December 31, 2016 are estimated to be a total
of $400 for UHN and, in the aggregate for UHN and the Related Public Funds, $554,800. 

Licensing Fees  

As discussed in Note 4 below, UHN entered into
a licensing agreement with the NYMEX on May 30, 2007, as amended on October 20, 2011. Pursuant to the agreement, UHN
and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee that is equal to 0.015% on all net assets.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, UHN incurred $396 and $564, respectively, under this arrangement. 

Investor Tax Reporting Cost  

The fees and expenses associated with UHN s
audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by UHN. These costs are estimated to be $64,000 for
the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Other Expenses and Fees and Expense Waivers  

In addition to the fees described above, UHN
pays all brokerage fees and other expenses in connection with the operation of UHN, excluding costs and expenses paid by USCF as
outlined in  Note 4   Contracts and Agreements  below. USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically
borne by UHN to the extent that such expenses exceed 0.15% (15 basis points) of UHN s NAV, on an annualized basis. USCF has
no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, USCF waived $74,612
of UHN s expenses. This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as
described in  Note 4   Contracts and Agreements  below. 

NOTE 4   CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS  

Marketing Agent Agreement  

UHN is party to a marketing agent agreement,
dated as of March 10, 2008, as amended from time to time, with the Marketing Agent and USCF, whereby the Marketing Agent provides
certain marketing services for UHN as outlined in the agreement. The fee of the Marketing Agent, which is borne by USCF, is equal
to 0.06% on UHN s assets up to $3 billion and 0.04% on UHN s assets in excess of $3 billion. In no event may the aggregate
compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services exceed 10% of the gross proceeds
of UHN s offering. 

The above fee does not include website construction
and development, which also are borne by USCF. 

Brown Brothers Harriman   Co. Agreements  

UHN is also party to a custodian agreement,
dated March 13, 2008, as amended from time to time, with Brown Brothers Harriman   Co. ( BBH Co. )
and USCF, whereby BBH Co. holds investments on behalf of UHN. USCF pays the fees of the custodian, which are determined
by the parties from time to time. In addition, UHN is party to an administrative agency agreement, dated February 7, 2008,
as amended from time to time, with USCF and BBH Co., whereby BBH Co. acts as the administrative agent, transfer agent and
registrar for UHN. USCF also pays the fees of BBH Co. for its services under such agreement and such fees are determined
by the parties from time to time. 

Currently, USCF pays BBH Co. for its services,
in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund accounting and fund administration services
rendered to UHN and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual fee for its transfer agency services. In
addition, USCF pays BBH Co. an asset-based charge of (a) 0.06% for the first $500 million of the Related Public Funds 
combined net assets, (b) 0.0465% for the Related Public Funds  combined net assets greater than $500 million but less
than $1 billion, and (c) 0.035% once the Related Public Funds  combined net assets exceed $1 billion. The annual minimum
amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000. USCF also pays BBH Co. transaction
fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction. 

Brokerage and Futures Commission Merchant
Agreements  

On October 8, 2013, UHN entered into a brokerage
agreement with RBC Capital Markets, LLC ( RBC Capital  or  RBC ) to serve as UHN s FCM effective
October 10, 2013. The agreement with RBC requires it to provide services to UHN in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures
Contracts and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through RBC for UHN s account.
In accordance with the agreement, RBC Capital charges UHN commissions of approximately $7 to $8 per round-turn trade, including
applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts. Such fees include those incurred when
purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UHN issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well
as fees incurred when selling Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when UHN redeems shares as a result of a Redemption
Basket. Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose
of rebalancing the portfolio. UHN also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Diesel-Heating
Oil-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ( Treasuries ). 

Total commissions accrued to brokers for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were similar. 

NYMEX Licensing Agreement  

UHN and the NYMEX entered into a licensing
agreement on May 30, 2007, as amended on October 20, 2011, whereby UHN was granted a non-exclusive license to use certain
of the NYMEX s settlement prices and service marks. Under the licensing agreement, UHN and the Related Public Funds, other
than BNO, USCI, CPER and USAG, pay the NYMEX an asset-based fee for the license, the terms of which are described in  Note 3 .
UHN expressly disclaims any association with the NYMEX or endorsement of UHN by the NYMEX and acknowledges that  NYMEX 
and  New York Mercantile Exchange  are registered trademarks of the NYMEX. 

NOTE 5   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OFF-BALANCE
SHEET RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES  

UHN engages in the trading of futures contracts,
options on futures contracts, and swaps (collectively,  derivatives ). UHN is exposed to both market risk, which is
the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk of failure by another party
to perform according to the terms of a contract. 

UHN may enter into futures contracts and options
on futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of an underlying commodity. A futures contract obligates the seller
to deliver (and the purchaser to accept) the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time
and place. Some futures contracts may call for physical delivery of the asset, while others are settled in cash. The contractual
obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or
by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated
date of delivery. Cleared swaps are agreements that are eligible to be cleared by a clearinghouse, e.g., ICE Clear Europe, and
provide the efficiencies and benefits that centralized clearing on an exchange offers to traders of futures contracts, including
credit risk intermediation and the ability to offset positions initiated with different counterparties. 

The purchase and sale of futures contracts
and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with an FCM. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract
value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary
activities. 

Futures contracts and options on futures contracts
involve, to varying degrees, elements of market risk (specifically commodity price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the
amount of variation margin. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure UHN has in the particular
classes of instruments. Additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts are an imperfect correlation between movements
in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market
for a futures contract. Buying and selling options on futures contracts exposes investors to the risks of purchasing or selling
futures contracts. 

All of the Futures Contracts held by UHN through
September 30, 2016 were exchange-traded. The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are generally perceived to be less
than those associated with OTC swaps since, in OTC swaps, a party must rely solely on the credit of its respective individual counterparties. However,
in the future, if UHN were to enter into non-exchange traded contracts, it would be subject to the credit risk associated with
counterparty non-performance. The credit risk from counterparty non-performance associated with such instruments is the net unrealized
gain, if any, on the transaction. UHN has credit risk under its futures contracts since the sole counterparty to all domestic and
foreign futures contracts is the clearinghouse for the exchange on which the relevant contracts are traded. In addition, UHN bears
the risk of financial failure by the clearing broker. 

UHN s cash and other property, such as
Treasuries, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds, subject to the FCM s segregation
requirements. In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available.
It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited. The insolvency of an
FCM could result in the complete loss of UHN s assets posted with that FCM; however, the majority of UHN s assets are
held in investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with UHN s custodian and would not be impacted by the insolvency
of an FCM. The failure or insolvency of UHN s custodian however, could result in a substantial loss of UHN s assets. 

USCF invests a portion of UHN s cash
in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable per share NAV. UHN is exposed to any risk of loss associated with an investment
in such money market funds. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, UHN held investments in money market funds in the amounts
of $1,200,000 and $600,000, respectively. USCF holds cash deposits with its custodian. Pursuant to a written agreement with
BBH Co., uninvested overnight cash balances are swept to offshore branches of U.S. regulated and domiciled banks located in
Toronto, Canada; London, United Kingdom; Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; and Nassau, Bahamas; which are subject to U.S. regulation
and regulatory oversight. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, UHN held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries
in the amounts of $3,581,772 and $2,322,704, respectively, with the custodian and FCM. Some or all of these amounts may be subject
to loss should UHN s custodian and/or FCM cease operations. 

For derivatives, risks arise from changes in
the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, UHN is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased
and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both a buyer and a seller of options, UHN pays or receives a premium at
the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. 

UHN s policy is to continuously monitor
its exposure to market and counterparty risk through the use of a variety of financial, position and credit exposure reporting
controls and procedures. In addition, UHN has a policy of requiring review of the credit standing of each broker or counterparty
with which it conducts business. The financial instruments held by UHN are reported in its condensed statements of financial condition
at market or fair value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly liquid nature and short-term
maturity. 

NOTE 6   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  

The following table presents per share performance
data and other supplemental financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the shareholders. This information
has been derived from information presented in the condensed financial statements. 

*  Annualized. 

Total returns are calculated based on the change
in value during the period. An individual shareholder s total return and ratio may vary from the above total returns
and ratios based on the timing of contributions to and withdrawals from UHN. 

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

UHN values its investments in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurement. The changes to past practice resulting from the application of ASC 820 relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained
from sources independent of UHN (observable inputs) and (2) UHN s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The three levels defined by the
ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows: 

Level I   Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for  identical  assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement
date. 

Level II   Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II assets include
the following: quoted prices for  similar  assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,
and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated
inputs). 

Level III   Unobservable pricing input
at the measurement date for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent
that observable inputs are not available. 

In some instances, the inputs used to measure
fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. 

The following table summarizes the valuation
of UHN s securities at September 30, 2016 using the fair value hierarchy: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no transfers
between Level I and Level II. 

The following table summarizes the valuation
of UHN s securities at December 31, 2015 using the fair value hierarchy: 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, there
were no transfers between Level I and Level II. 

Effective January 1, 2009, UHN adopted
the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815   Derivatives and Hedging, which require presentation of qualitative
disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains
and losses on derivatives.

Forward-Looking Information  

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including
this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  contains forward-looking
statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UHN s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements, which involve assumptions and describe UHN s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable
by use of the words  may,   will,   should,   expect,   anticipate, 
 estimate,   believe,   intend  or  project,  the negative of these words, other
variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be
incorrect, and UHN cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. UHN s
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors. 

UHN has based the forward-looking statements
included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q,
and UHN assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although UHN undertakes no obligation to revise
or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised
to consult any additional disclosures that UHN may make directly to them or through reports that UHN in the future files with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 

Introduction  

UHN, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity
pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). The investment
objective of UHN is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares  per share net asset value ( NAV )
to reflect the daily changes, in percentage terms, of the spot price of heating oil, as measured by the daily changes, in the price
of a specified short-term futures contract on heating oil (also known as No. 2 fuel oil), for delivery to the New York harbor,
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the  NYMEX ) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the
near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next
month contract to expire (the  Benchmark Futures Contract ), plus interest earned on UHN s collateral holdings,
less UHN s expenses.  Near month contract  means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire.  Next
month contract  means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract. 

UHN s investment objective is  not 
for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of heating oil or any particular futures contract
based on heating oil,  nor  is UHN s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage
change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period  greater than one day . The general
partner of UHN, United States Commodity Funds LLC ( USCF ), believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio
to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Oil-Related Investments (as
defined below). 

UHN invests primarily in futures contracts
for heating oil, crude oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange
( ICE Futures ) or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively,  Futures Contracts ) and to a lesser
extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other oil-related investments such as
cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for diesel-heating oil, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter
( OTC ) swaps that are based on the price of diesel-heating oil, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures
Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively,  Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments ). For
convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments collectively are
referred to as  Diesel-Heating Oil Interests  in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities
will cause daily changes in UHN s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in UHN s
per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that daily changes in prices of the Benchmark Futures Contract have
historically closely tracked the daily changes in spot prices of heating oil. USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships
will be that the daily changes in the price of UHN s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the
daily changes in the spot price of a barrel of heating oil on a percentage basis, plus interest earned on UHN s collateral
holdings, less UHN s expenses. 

UHN seeks to achieve its investment objective
by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UHN s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will
be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract over
the same period. 

Regulatory Disclosure  

Accountability Levels, Position Limits and
Price Fluctuation Limits . Designated contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels
and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons
under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UHN is not) may hold, own or control. These levels
and position limits apply to the futures contracts that UHN invests in to meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability
levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price
fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous
day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades
may be made at a price beyond that limit. 

The accountability levels for the Benchmark
Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on US-based exchanges such as the NYMEX are not a fixed ceiling, but rather
a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions. The current accountability
level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 5,000 net contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes
an accountability level for all months of 7,000 net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for heating oil. In
addition, ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its heating oil contract
as the NYMEX. If UHN and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for
diesel-heating oil, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor UHN s and the Related Public Funds  exposure and may ask
for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the
extent of liquidity resources of UHN and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UHN could
be ordered to reduce its aggregate net futures contracts position back to the accountability level. As of September 30, 2016, UHN
held 84 Heating Oil Futures HO Contracts traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, UHN did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX or ICE Futures. 

Position limits differ from accountability
levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow
such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that
may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in
the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that UHN will run up against such position limits because UHN s investment
strategy is to close out its positions and  roll  from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract
beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, UHN did not exceed any position
limits imposed by the NYMEX and the ICE Futures. 

The regulation of commodity interest trading
in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. The various statements made in this summary are subject
to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
( FINRA ), CFTC, the National Futures Association (the  NFA ), the futures exchanges, clearing organizations
and other regulatory bodies. 

Futures Contracts and Position Limits   

The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute
from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing
of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered
and sold in the United States. 

The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative
positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in
the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required
to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the  Position Limit Rules ). The
Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds
that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined;
create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract
markets ( DCMs ) and swap execution facilities ( SEFs ) to establish position limits or, in some cases,
position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S.
located platforms. The CFTC s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged
by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple
times. 

Until such time as the Position Limit Rules
are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in
commodities and related derivatives (collectively,  Referenced Contracts ). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal
limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and
accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, UHN may be limited
with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions,
the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts
held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures
exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit
Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions
with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well
as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is
unclear how the Position Limit Rules affect UHN, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position
Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of UHN to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF s
ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of UHN. 

Swap  Transactions   

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) imposes regulatory requirements on certain  swap  transactions that
UHN is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of UHN to meet its investment objective. The term  swap 
is broadly defined to include various types of OTC derivatives, including swaps and options. 

CFTC regulations require that certain transactions
ultimately falling within the definition of  swap  be executed on organized exchanges or  swap execution facilities 
and cleared through regulated clearing organizations ( CCPs ).  Clearing  refers to the process by which
a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a CCP, via a clearing member ( i.e ., an FCM) and replaced
by two mirror swaps, with the CCP becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap. CCPs have several layers
of protection against default including margin, member capital contributions and FCM guarantees of their customers  transactions
with the CCP. FCMs also pre-qualify the counterparties to all swaps that are sent to the CCP from a credit perspective, setting
limits for each counterparty and collecting initial and variation margin daily from each counterparty for changes in the value
of cleared swaps. The margin collected from both parties to the swap protects against credit risk in the event a counterparty defaults.
The initial and variation margin requirements are set by and held for the benefit of the CCP. Additional initial margin may be
required and held by the FCM. 

Current rules and regulations require enhanced
customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures
and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that
customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures
trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the
capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs
of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner. 

Certain index-based credit default swaps and
interest rate swaps are subject to mandatory clearing. If UHN enters into index-based credit default swaps or interest rate swaps
that are subject to mandatory clearing, UHN will be required to centrally clear those swaps. 

To the extent that a swap is required to be
cleared, it must also be executed on a SEF or DCM if it is designated as  made available to trade  by a SEF or DCM.
 Made available to trade  refers to the regulatory process by which the SEF or DCM execution requirement is implemented
by the CFTC. To date, only certain of the index-based credit default swaps and interest rate swaps that are required to be cleared
are made available to trade on a SEF. If UHN enters into index-based credit default swaps or interest rate swaps that are subject
to mandatory clearing, UHN will be required to execute those swaps on a SEF if they are designated as made available to trade.
In order to execute swaps on a SEF, UHN will have to be a member of a SEF or it may access the SEF through an intermediary. Members
of a SEF are subject to additional requirements under CFTC regulations and are subject to the rules and jurisdiction of the relevant
SEF. 

Swaps that are not required to be cleared and
executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including,
among others, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation
requirements and dispute resolution requirements. In addition, U.S. regulators have adopted rules to impose initial and variation
margin requirements that will apply to swap dealers and major swap participants and their counterparties. If UHN engages in non-cleared
swap transactions it will be subject to some or all of the requirements of the margin rules, which include a requirement that swap
dealers and major swap participants collect variation margin daily, beginning in March 2017, and, potentially initial margin, beginning
in September 2020. 

In addition to the rules and regulations imposed
under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation
( EMIR ). EMIR imposes requirements on non-cleared derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the CFTC and other
regulators in the United States and which are described above. UHN may be indirectly impacted by EMIR to the extent that it engages
in derivatives transactions with entities that are subject to EMIR. 

On August 12, 2013, the CFTC issued final rules
establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators ( CPOs ) of investment companies registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  Investment Company Act ) that are required to register due to
recent changes to CFTC Regulation 4.5. The final rules were issued in a CFTC release entitled  Harmonization of Compliance
Obligations for Registered Investment Companies Required to Register as Commodity Pool Operators.  Although UHN is not a
registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Harmonization Rules amended certain CFTC disclosure rules to
make the requirements for all CPOs to periodically update their disclosure documents consistent with those of the SEC. This change
decreased the burden on UHN and USCF of having to comply with certain inconsistent regulatory requirements. Other non-U.S. jurisdictions
also impose obligations with respect to OTC swaps that could impact UHN if it were to engage in OTC swaps with non-U.S. persons. 

Money Market Reform   

The SEC adopted Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 on July 23, 2014, which goes effective on October 14, 2016, to reform money market funds ( MMFs ).
While the new rule applies only to MMFs, it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as UHN. The new rule requires institutional
prime MMFs to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a  floating
net asset value per share  or  floating NAV ). Government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized
cost method to value their portfolio securities. Additionally, liquidity fees and gates allowing an MMF s board of directors
to directly address runs on a fund. MMFs  boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent runs
by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates (temporary suspension of redemptions). The fees and gates could be imposed
on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government MMFs. UHN currently
invests in government MMFs, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for assets not used
for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts. UHN does not hold any non-government MMFs and, currently, does not anticipate
investing in any non-government MMFs. The new rule further decreases the likelihood that UHN would invest in any non-governmental
MMFs. However, if UHN were to make investments in non-government MMFs in the future, such investments could negatively impact UHN
because of the changes to MMFs resulting from the new rule. 

Price Movements  

Diesel-heating oil futures prices were volatile
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and ended higher than the start of the period. The price of the Benchmark Futures
Contract started the period at $1.124 per gallon. It hit a peak on June 8, 2016 at a price of $1.571 per gallon. The low of the
period was on January 20, 2016 when the price dropped to $0.878 per gallon. The period ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract
at $1.538 per gallon, an increase of approximately 36.83% over the period. UHN s per share NAV began the period at $12.48
and ended the period at $15.51 on September 30, 2016, an increase of 24.28% over the period. UHN s per share NAV reached
its high for the period on June 8, 2016 at $16.58 and reached its low for the period on January 20, 2016 at $9.60. The Benchmark
Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2016 contract and ended with August 2016 contract. The increase of
approximately 36.83% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved
by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period
described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts,
measured from the start of the period to the end of the period, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UHN seeks
to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled   Tracking UHN s Benchmark.   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the crude oil futures market was in a state of contango, meaning that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract
was lower than the price of the next month crude oil futures contract, and contracts further away from expiration. (On days when
the market is in backwardation, the price of the near month crude oil futures contract is typically higher than the price of the
next month crude oil futures contract or contracts further away from expiration.) For a discussion of the impact of backwardation
and contango on total returns, see   Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns   below. 

Valuation of Futures Contracts and
the Computation of the Per Share NAV  

The per share NAV of UHN s shares is
calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m.
New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
UHN s administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New
York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UHN investments, including
ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York
time.  

Results of Operations and the Diesel-Heating
Oil Market  

Results of Operations.  On April 9,
2008, UHN listed its shares on the American Stock Exchange (the  AMEX ) under the ticker symbol  UHN. 
On that day, UHN established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 200,000 shares to the initial Authorized
Participant in exchange for $10,000,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, UHN s
shares ceased trading on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008. 

Since its initial offering of 10,000,000 shares,
UHN has registered one subsequent offering of its shares: 50,000,000 shares which were registered with the SEC on April 30,
2010. Shares offered by UHN in the subsequent offering were sold by it for cash at the shares  per share NAV as described
in the applicable prospectus. As of September 30, 2016, UHN had issued 1,300,000 shares, 350,000 of which were outstanding. As
of September 30, 2016, there were 58,700,000 shares registered but not yet issued. 

More shares may have been issued by UHN than
are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Unlike funds that are registered under the Investment Company Act shares
that have been redeemed by UHN cannot be resold by UHN. As a result, UHN contemplates that additional offerings of its shares
will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions. 

As of September 30, 2016, UHN had the following
Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC, Nomura Securities
International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC. 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Portfolio Expenses . UHN s expenses consist
of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, the fees and expenses
of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee
that UHN pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UHN. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. 

Average interest rates earned on short-term
investments held by UHN, including cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As a result, the amount of income earned by UHN as a percentage of average
total net assets was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

The increase in UHN s total fees and
expenses excluding management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015, was due to an increase in certain of UHN s operating expenses. 

Total commissions accrued to brokers by UHN
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were similar.

total net assets was higher during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. 

The increase in UHN s total fees and

for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, were similar. 

Tracking UHN s Benchmark  

USCF seeks to manage UHN s portfolio
such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price
of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that
over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in UHN s per share NAV is within a range of 90% to
110% (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. As an example, if the average
daily movement of the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.5% per
day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time
period fell between 0.45% and 0.55% ( i.e ., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results). UHN s portfolio
management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UHN s per share NAV equal to the nominal price of the
current Benchmark Futures Contract or the spot price for diesel-heating oil. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage
the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts. 

For
the 30-valuation days ended September 30, 2016, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract was (0.009)%,
while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UHN over the same time period was (0.013)%. The average difference
was (0.004)% (or (0.4) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the
Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in tracking by the per share NAV was 0.095%, meaning that over this time period
UHN s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.  

Since the commencement of the offering of UHN s
shares to the public on April 9, 2008 to September 30, 2016, the simple average daily change in the Benchmark Futures Contract
was (0.031)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of UHN over the same time period was (0.033)%. The average
daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily
movement of the Benchmark Futures Contract, the average error in daily tracking by the per share NAV was (0.913)%, meaning that
over this time period UHN s tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal.
The following two graphs demonstrate the correlation between the changes in UHN s NAV and the changes in the Benchmark Futures
Contract. The first graph exhibits the daily changes for the last 30 valuation days ended September 30, 2016; the second graph
measures monthly changes from September 30, 2011 through September 30, 2016.

OF FUTURE RESULTS   

*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE
OF FUTURE RESULTS   

An alternative tracking measurement of the
return performance of UHN versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return
of UHN, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the  expected  changes in its per share NAV under the assumption
that UHN s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its Benchmark Futures Contract. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the actual total return of UHN as measured by changes in its per share NAV was 24.28%. This is based on an initial per share
NAV of $12.48 as of December 31, 2015 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2016 of $15.51. During this time
period, UHN made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if UHN s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead
exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UHN would have had an estimated per share
NAV of $15.61 as of September 30, 2016, for a total return over the relevant time period of 25.08%. The difference between
the actual per share NAV total return of UHN of 24.28% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract of
25.08% was an error over the time period of (0.80)%, which is to say that UHN s actual total return underperformed the benchmark
result by that percentage. UHN incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and
selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV
of UHN to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. 

By comparison, for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the actual total return of UHN as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (14.96)%. This is based on an initial
per share NAV of $21.53 as of December 31, 2014 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2015 of $18.31. During
this time period, UHN made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if UHN s daily changes in its per share NAV
had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contract, UHN would have had an estimated
per share NAV of $18.38 as of September 30, 2015, for a total return over the relevant time period of (14.63)%. The difference
between the actual per share NAV total return of UHN of (14.96)% and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contract
of (14.63)% was an error over the time period of (0.33)%, which is to say that UHN s actual total return underperformed the
benchmark result by that percentage. UHN incurred expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for
the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tended to cause daily changes in
the per share NAV of UHN to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. 

There are currently three factors that have
impacted or are most likely to impact UHN s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contract. 

First, UHN may buy or sell its holdings in
the then current Benchmark Futures Contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during
which UHN executes the trade. In that case, UHN may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than that of the Benchmark Futures
Contract, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of UHN to either be too high or too low relative to the
daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, USCF attempted to minimize the
effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contract at, or as close as possible
to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for UHN to obtain the closing settlement price
and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UHN s
attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contract over time. 

Second, UHN incurs expenses primarily composed
of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of Futures Contracts, and other expenses. The impact of
these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UHN to track slightly lower than daily changes in the price
of the Benchmark Futures Contract. At the same time, UHN earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents
and Treasuries. UHN is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions
to shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within
the portfolio and added to UHN s NAV. When this income exceeds the level of UHN s expenses for its management
fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses
of the independent directors of USCF), UHN will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV
of UHN to track slightly higher than daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. If short-term interest rates rise above
the current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were
to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would increase. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the
combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would
tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contract. USCF
anticipates that interest rates will continue to remain at historical lows and, therefore, it is anticipated that fees and expenses
paid by UHN will continue to be higher than interest earned by UHN. As such, USCF anticipates that UHN will continue to underperform
its benchmark until such a time when interest earned at least equals or exceeds the fees and expenses paid by UHN. 

Third, UHN may hold Other Diesel-Heating
Oil-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contract s total return
movements. In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contract could result in daily changes in the per
share NAV of UHN that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, UHN did not hold any Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments. If UHN increases in
size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits, UHN may invest in Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments,
which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error. 

Term Structure of Diesel-Heating Oil Futures
Prices and the Impact on Total Returns.  Several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract
position. One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month Futures Contracts and
 rolling  those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and
the next month contract. For example, if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation
referred to as  backwardation  in the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price
of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if
the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a situation referred to as  contango  in
the futures market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value
as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration. 

As an example, assume that the price of diesel-heating
oil for immediate delivery (the  spot  price), was $2 per gallon, and the value of a position in the near month futures
contract was also $2. Over time, the price of a gallon of diesel-heating oil will fluctuate based on a number of market
factors, including demand for diesel-heating oil relative to its supply. The value of the near month contract will likewise
fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract
and not take delivery of the diesel-heating oil, every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches
expiration and invest in the next month contract. 

If the futures market is in backwardation,
 e.g. , when the expected price of diesel-heating oil in the future would be less, the investor would be buying a next month
contract for a lower price than the current near month contract. Using the $2 per barrel price above to represent the front month
price, the price of the next month contract could be $1.96 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper than the front month contract. Hypothetically,
and assuming no other changes to either prevailing diesel-heating oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price,
the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash
and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $1.96 next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new
near month contract with a price of $2. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend
to rise faster than the spot price of diesel-heating oil, or fall slower. As a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical
example for the spot price of diesel-heating oil to have risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the investment
in the second month futures contract would have risen 12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed. Similarly,
the spot price of diesel-heating oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have
fallen only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant, the difference would continue to increase. 

If the futures market is in contango, the investor
would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract. Using again the $2 per barrel
price above to represent the front month price, the price of the next month contract could be $2.04 per barrel, that is, 2% more
expensive than the front month contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either prevailing diesel-heating oil
prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract (and ignoring the
impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month contract would fall
as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of $2. In this example, it would mean that
the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of diesel-heating oil, or fall faster. As
a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of diesel-heating oil to have risen 10% after
some period of time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango
is large enough or enough time has elapsed. Similarly, the spot price of diesel-heating oil could have fallen 10% while the
value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant,
the difference would continue to increase. 

The chart below compares the price of the near
month contract to the price of the next month contract over the last 10 years for diesel-heating oil. When the price of the
near month contract is higher than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation.
When the price of the near month contract is lower than the price of the next month contract, the market would be described as
being in contango. Although the prices of the near month contract and the price of the next month contract do tend to move up or
down together, it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the price of the next month contract
(backwardation), and other times they are below the price of the next month contract (contango). In addition, investors can
observe that diesel-heating oil prices, both near month and next month, often display a seasonal pattern in which the price of
diesel-heating oil tends to decline in the summer months and increase in the winter months and. This mirrors the physical
demand for diesel-heating oil, which typically peaks in the winter. 

*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE
OF FUTURE RESULTS   

An alternative way to view backwardation and
contango data over time is to subtract the dollar price of the next month diesel-heating oil futures contract from the dollar price
of the near month diesel-heating oil futures contract. If the resulting number is a positive number, then the price of the
near month contract is higher than the price of the next month and the market could be described as being in backwardation. If
the resulting number is a negative number, then the near month price is lower than the price of the next month and the market could
be described as being in contango. The chart below shows the results from subtracting the next month contract price from the
price of the near month contract for the 10-year period between September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2016. Investors will note
that the near month diesel-heating oil futures contract spent time in both backwardation and contango. Investors will further
note that the markets display a very seasonal pattern that corresponds to the seasonal demand patterns for diesel-heating oil mentioned
above. That is, in many, but not all cases, the price of the near month is higher than the next month (or if the near month
is lower, the degree that it is below the next month is smaller) during the middle of the winter months as the price of diesel-heating
oil for delivery in those winter months rises to meet peak demand. At the same time, the price of the near month contract,
when that month is just before the onset of fall, does not rise as far or as fast as the price of a next month contract whose delivery
falls closer to the start of the winter season. 

* PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY
INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS   

While the investment objective of UHN
is not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the spot price of diesel-heating oil, contango
and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in UHN shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical
direct investment in diesel-heating oil. For example, an investment in UHN shares made on December 31, 2015 and held to September
30, 2016 increased based upon the changes in the per share NAV for UHN shares on those days by approximately 24.28%, while the
Benchmark Futures Contract increased 36.87% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning
and storing diesel-heating oil, which could be substantial). By comparison, an investment in UHN shares made on December 31, 2014
and held to September 30, 2015 decreased based upon the changes in the per share NAV for UHN shares on those days by approximately
(14.96)%, while the Benchmark Futures Contract decreased by (16.15)% (note: this comparison ignores the potential costs associated
with physically owning and storing diesel-heating oil, which could be substantial). 

Periods of contango or backwardation do not
materially impact UHN s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally
impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UHN s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contract. It is impossible
to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both
conditions will occur during different periods. 

Heating Oil Market.  During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the price of heating oil in the United States was primarily impacted by movements in crude oil
prices, the input for heating oil. 

Crude Oil Market . During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, crude oil prices were impacted by several factors. Crude oil inventories in the United States stood at
approximately 469 million barrels by the end of September, approximately 9% higher than the same week a year earlier. Storage increased
steadily during the first three quarters of 2016, peaking at 512 million barrels, by far the highest volume since the EIA began
reporting storage data in 1982. The new storage record was achieved early in the second quarter before declining on lower U.S.
production and production disruptions overseas. The final weekly production level reported by the Department of Energy in the third
quarter of 2016 was about 12% lower than the peak reached in June of 2015. United States crude oil prices finished the third quarter
of 2016 approximately 30.24% higher than at the beginning of the year. Prices firmed as supply disruptions abroad improved the
global supply and demand balance, as U.S. production declined, and as inventories began to fall from peak levels. Should supply
resume an upward trajectory or should the global economic situation decline there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices
could fall, while disruptions due to conflicts in the Middle East would likely have the opposite effect. 

USCF believes that over both the medium term
and long term, changes in the price of crude oil will exert the greatest influence on the price of refined petroleum products such
as diesel-heating oil. At the same time, there can be other factors that, particularly in the short term, cause the price of diesel-heating
oil to rise (or fall), more (or less) than the price of crude oil. For example, warmer weather during the high demand period of
the winter season could cause American consumers to reduce their diesel-heating oil consumption. Furthermore, diesel-heating oil
prices are impacted by the availability of refining capacity. As a result, it is possible that changes in diesel-heating oil prices
may not match the changes in crude oil prices. 

Diesel-Heating Oil Price Movements in Comparison
to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories.  USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which
prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically,
such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes
over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move
up or down in price or value together, known as  positive correlation,  and -1 indicates that they move in completely
opposite directions, known as  negative correlation.  A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the
two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as  non-correlation.  That is, the investment options
sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions. 

For the ten-year time period between September
30, 2006 and September 30, 2016, the table below compares the monthly movements of diesel-heating oil prices versus the monthly
movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as natural gas, crude oil and unleaded gasoline, as well as several
major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities. It can
be seen that over this particular time period, the movements in diesel-heating oil on a monthly basis were somewhat correlated
with the movements of large cap U.S. equities, global equities, and natural gas. However, movements in diesel-heating oil were
strongly correlated to movements in crude oil and unleaded gasoline and somewhat inversely correlated with the movements of U.S.
government bonds.

The table below covers a more recent, but much
shorter, range of dates than the above table. Over the one-year period ended September 30, 2016, diesel-heating oil still
showed neither strongly correlated nor inversely correlated movements with large cap U.S. equities, global equities or natural
gas. Movements in diesel-heating oil were strongly correlated to the movements in crude oil and unleaded gasoline, and somewhat
inversely correlated to movements in U.S. government bonds.

Investors are cautioned that the historical
price relationships between diesel-heating oil and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes,
as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results. The results pictured
above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that diesel-heating oil has
historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes
that in the future it is possible that diesel-heating oil could have long-term correlation results that indicate prices of diesel-heating
oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods
shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of diesel-heating oil to equities and bonds will
be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long-term historical results suggest. 

The correlations between diesel-heating
oil, crude oil, natural gas and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UHN s assets in Futures Contracts
and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UHN s per share NAV correlate
as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract. If certain other
fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the Benchmark Futures Contract, then their use could
lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the
Benchmark Futures Contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of diesel-heating oil. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Preparation of the condensed financial statements
and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the
application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. UHN s application of these policies
involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 

USCF has evaluated the nature and types of
estimates that it makes in preparing UHN s condensed financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that
the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such
as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by UHN for its Futures Contracts
are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value
of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts
prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, UHN estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis
using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a
monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

UHN has not made, and does not anticipate making,
use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. UHN has met, and it is anticipated that UHN will continue
to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries,
cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. UHN s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing
margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its
OTC swaps and payment of its expenses, summarized below under  Contractual Obligations.  

UHN currently generates cash primarily
from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares ( Creation Baskets ) and (ii) income earned on
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. UHN has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Diesel-Heating
Oil Interests. UHN invests in Diesel-Heating Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable
to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other
Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments. A significant portion of UHN s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that
are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Diesel-Heating Oil Interests. The balance of the assets is held in
UHN s account at its custodian bank and in Treasuries at the FCM. Income received from UHN s money market funds
and Treasuries is paid to UHN. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, UHN s expenses exceeded the income UHN earned
and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, UHN used other assets to pay expenses which would cause a decrease in UHN s NAV over time. To the extent expenses
exceed income, UHN s NAV will be negatively impacted. 

UHN s investments in Diesel-Heating Oil
Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For
example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred
to as  daily limits.  During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price
of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither
be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market
conditions could prevent UHN from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, UHN did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UHN cannot predict
whether such an event may occur in the future. 

Since the initial offering of shares, UHN has
been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing
fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of
its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses
of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business, while
USCF has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of UHN s Marketing Agent, administrator and Custodian and registration
expenses relating to the initial offering of shares. If USCF and UHN are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to
cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding, UHN will terminate and investors may lose all or part
of their investment. 

Market Risk  

Trading in Futures Contracts and Other
Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UHN entering into contractual commitments to purchase or
sell diesel-heating oil at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly
exceed UHN s future cash requirements since UHN intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result,
UHN is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. UHN considers
the  fair value  of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk
associated with UHN s commitments to purchase diesel-heating oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts
held. However, should UHN enter into a contractual commitment to sell diesel-heating oil, it would be required to make delivery
of the diesel-heating oil at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are
no limits on the future price of diesel-heating oil, the market risk to UHN could be unlimited. 

UHN s exposure to market risk depends
on a number of factors, including the markets for diesel-heating oil, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates,
the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments markets and the relationships among
the contracts held by UHN. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an
investor s capital. 

Credit Risk  

When UHN enters into Futures Contracts
and Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet
its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is
the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the
clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the
financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should
significantly reduce credit risk. UHN is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by
their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance
that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UHN in such
circumstances. 

USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of
UHN by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, UHN generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets
that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other
Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing
and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the
benefit of UHN to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of UHN in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures
Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging
to UHN, all assets of UHN relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UHN s
assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account UHN s assets
related to foreign Futures Contracts trading. 

In the future, UHN may purchase OTC swaps,
see   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q
for a discussion of OTC swaps. 

As of September 30, 2016, UHN held cash deposits
and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of $4,781,772 with the custodian and FCM. Some or all of these
amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should UHN s custodian and/or FCM, as applicable,
cease operations. 

Off Balance Sheet Financing  

As of September 30, 2016, UHN had no loan guarantee,
credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business,
which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services
which are in the best interests of UHN. While UHN s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated,
they are not expected to have a material impact on UHN s financial position. 

European Sovereign Debt  

UHN had no direct exposure to European sovereign
debt as of September 30, 2016 and has no direct exposure to European sovereign debt as of the filing of this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q. 

Redemption Basket Obligation  

In order to meet its investment objective and
pay its contractual obligations described below, UHN requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks
of 50,000 shares called  Redemption Baskets.  UHN has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash
or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being
redeemed. 

Contractual Obligations  

UHN s primary contractual obligations
are with USCF. In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage
of UHN s NAV, currently 0.60% of NAV on its average daily total net assets. 

USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs
associated with the formation of UHN, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration
with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UHN and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly,
AMEX), respectively. However, since UHN s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering
and listing additional shares of UHN have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UHN, and not by USCF. 

USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent
and the fees of BBH Co., as well as BBH Co. s fees for performing administrative services, including those in connection
with the preparation of UHN s condensed financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports. USCF and UHN have
also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which UHN and the Related Public Funds, other than BNO,
USCI, CPER and USAG, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX. UHN also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting
and reporting requirements. USCF has voluntarily agreed to pay certain expenses typically borne by UHN to the extent that such
expenses exceed 0.15% (15 basis points) of UHN s NAV, on an annualized basis. USCF has no obligation to continue such payments
into subsequent periods. This voluntary expense waiver is in addition to those amounts USCF is contractually obligated to pay as
described in  Note 4  in  Item 1  of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

In addition to USCF s management fee,
UHN pays its brokerage fees (including fees to an FCM), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property,
and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection
with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary
expenses. The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UHN s business, including expenses relating
to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement,
the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the
settlement of claims and litigation. Commission payments to an FCM are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis. UHN also
pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF. See  Note 3  to the  Notes to Condensed
Financial Statements (Unaudited)  in  Item 1  of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

The parties cannot anticipate the amount of
payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UHN s per share NAVs and trading levels to
meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed
upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UHN s existence. Either
party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements. 

As of September 30, 2016, UHN s portfolio
consisted of 84 Heating Oil Futures HO Contracts traded on the NYMEX. As of September 30, 2016, UHN did not hold any Futures Contracts
traded on ICE Futures Europe. For a list of UHN s current holdings, please see UHN s website at www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.  

OTC Contract Risk   

Currently, OTC transactions are subject
to changing regulation.   

UHN may purchase OTC contracts, such as forward
contracts or swap or spot contracts. Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures,
each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. 

UHN may enter into certain transactions where
an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract ( Exchange for Related Position  or  EFRP 
transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UHN, the OTC component is the purchase and sale of one
or more baskets of UHN s shares. These EFRP transactions may expose UHN to counterparty risk during the interim period between
the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from
the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution. 

Swap transactions, like other financial transactions,
involve a variety of significant risks. The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the
terms and circumstances of the transaction. In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk,
credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. 

Highly customized swap transactions in particular
may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions. Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial
gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor. 

In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations
associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated
only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Therefore, it may not
be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UHN s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction
prior to its scheduled termination date. 

To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection
with such contracts, UHN will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published
by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty,
if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UHN due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency
of the counterparty. 

USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the
creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF s board
of directors (the  Board ). Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UHN only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are,
or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by
the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether
or not regulated by the CFTC. Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United
Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel. Existing counterparties are also reviewed
periodically by USCF. UHN will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support.
Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party
open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction
in such situations. 

In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less
certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared
swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated,
and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers
and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually
obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent
value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. 

During the nine month reporting period ended
September 30, 2016, UHN limited its OTC activities to EFRP transactions. 

UHN anticipates that the use of Other Diesel-Heating
Oil-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely
track the investment goals of UHN. However, there can be no assurance of this. OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related
expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UHN s
ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contract. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

UHN maintains disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in UHN s periodic reports filed or submitted under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. 

The duly appointed officers of USCF, including
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of UHN if UHN had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UHN s disclosure
controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UHN have been effective as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Change in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in UHN s internal
control over financial reporting during UHN s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, UHN s internal control over financial reporting.
