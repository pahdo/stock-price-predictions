      Basis
    of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of OriginClear, Inc. (the  Company ) (formerly OriginOil, Inc.)
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016. For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Going
Concern   

  The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business. The accompanying condensed financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated significant revenue, and has negative cash flows
from operations, which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among
other things, additional cash infusion. Management believes the existing shareholders, the prospective new investors and
future sales will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, and will
allow the development of its core business operations. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain
additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.  

2.  
      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES   

This
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for
their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OriginClear, Inc. and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries,
Progressive Water Treatment, Inc., (PWT) and OriginClear Company, Ltd. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated
upon consolidation of these entities.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Equipment
sales    

  We
recognize revenue upon delivery of equipment, provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, title, and risk of loss have passed
to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Title to the
equipment is transferred to the customer once the last payment is received. We record revenue as goods are shipped, and the equipment
has been fully accepted by the customer. Generally, we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral. We do not
ship a product until we have a purchase agreement signed by the customer with a payment arrangement.  

Percentage
of completion    

  Revenues
and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting
in accordance with ASC 605-35     Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts .
 Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct
proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct
material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general
and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company
will recognize the loss as it is determined.  

The
asset  Costs in excess of billings  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress.
The liability  Billings in excess of costs  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in progress.
Assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts are included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying
balance sheets, as they will be liquidated in the normal course of the contract completion.  

Revisions
in cost and profit estimates during the course of the contract are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts for the
revisions become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty
provisions, and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, which are recognized in the period the
revisions are determined.

2.  
      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES (Continued)   

Contract
Receivable   

  The
Company bills its customers in accordance with contractual agreements. The agreements generally require billing to be on a progressive
basis as work is completed. Credit is extended based on evaluation of clients financial condition and collateral is not required.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any customer is unable to make
required payments. Management performs a quantitative and qualitative review of the receivables past due from customers on a monthly
basis. The Company records an allowance against uncollectible items for each customer after all reasonable means of collection
have been exhausted, and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately
$50,000 as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net contract receivable balance was $391,035 and $0 at September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to the acquisition of PWT.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

  The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the award is measured
on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and
vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the
value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance
commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee
stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances
where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.  

On
September 29, 2015, the Company adopted and approved a new incentive stock option plan and reserved 8,000,000 shares of common
stock at par value $0.0001 per share of the Corporation for issuance.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet,
where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016, the balances reported for cash, prepaid expenses, accounts
payable, and accrued expenses approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.  

We
adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value,
established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
These tiers include:  

Level
    1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;   

Level
    2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as
    quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
    are not active; and   

Level
3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions,
such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are
unobservable.    

The
following table presents certain liabilities of the Company s financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on the
Company s balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016:

2.  
      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES (Continued)   

The
following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining the approximate fair
value:  

Loss
per Share Calculations   

  Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased
to include securities or other contracts to issue common stock that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares
had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has excluded 113,916,311 stock options, 17,824,259 common stock purchase
warrants outstanding, and $4,214,068 convertible notes that are convertible into shares of common stock, because their impact
on the loss per share is anti-dilutive.   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company has excluded 3,954,644
stock options, 23,749,549 common stock purchase warrants outstanding, and $4,741,858 convertible notes that are convertible into
shares of common stock, because their impact on the loss per share is anti-dilutive.    

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used in valuing our stock options, warrants, convertible
notes, and common stock issued for services, among other items. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

  The
Company adopted the guidance of ASC Topic 810  Consolidation  of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to determine
whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10 all majority-owned subsidiaries all
entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest
with the parent, the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely
to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.
Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting
interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent
of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also
exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree.
The Company consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries, if any, in which the parent s power to control exists.  

The
consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the entities at September 30, 2016.

Foreign
Currency Matters   

  We
adopted ASC Topic 830    Foreign Currency Matters,  which relates to translating the records of a foreign subsidiary
from its functional currency into the reporting currency. The records are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). The financial position and results of operations of the Company s foreign subsidiary is measured using the foreign
subsidiary s local currency as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of such subsidiary has been translated into
U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates
of exchange on the balance sheet date. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate
component of shareholders  equity, unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investments.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in a loss of $17.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-09,  Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee
share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payments award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments
are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-9 on the Company s financial statements.   

In
March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Contingent
Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments . The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt
instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. U.S. GAAP
provides specific guidance for assessing whether call (put) options that can accelerate the repayment of principal on a debt instrument
meet the clearly and closely related criterion. The guidance states that for contingent call (put) options to be considered clearly
and closely related, they can be indexed only to interest rates or credit risk. Public companies must apply the new requirements
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-06 on the Company s financial statements.   

In
May 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments do not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. The amendments
provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. These amendments are effective at the same
time Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year entity). The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-12 on the Company s financial statements.  

In
August 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230)   Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-15 on the Company s financial statements.   

Management does not believe that any other recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

      BUSINESS ACQUISITION (Continued)   

Each share of Series B Preferred
Stock has a stated value of $150 per share and is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock in three annual increments
beginning 12 months from closing. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the case of reverse splits, stock dividends,
reclassifications and the like. In addition, the conversion price is subject to certain full ratchet anti-dilution protection.
The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to vote with the holders of the Company s common stock on all corporate actions,
including the election of the Company s directors. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to cast one vote
for each share of Series B Preferred Stock owed. This brief description of the Certificate of Designation is only a summary of
the material terms. 

The
acquisition was accounted for under ASC 805. PWT is engaged in providing water treatment systems and services for a wide variety
of applications and component sales. The acquisition is designed to enhance our services in water treatment. PWT became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.  

Under
the purchase method of accounting, the transactions were valued for accounting purposes at $1,500,000, which was the fair value
of PWT at the time of acquisition. The assets and liabilities of PWT were recorded at their respective fair value as of the date
of acquisition. Since, the Company determined there were no other separately identifiable intangible assets, any difference between
the cost of the acquired entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The
acquisition date estimated fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has not identified any intangible assets other than goodwill. However, the above estimated
fair value of the intangible assets of PWT is based on a preliminary purchase price allocation prepared by management. As a result,
during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the preliminary
purchase price allocation period, we record adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price
allocation period in our operating results in the period in which the adjustments were determined.

      CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES   

On
various dates the Company entered into unsecured convertible Notes (the  Convertible Promissory Notes  or  Notes ),
that mature between six and nine months from the date of issuance and bear interest at 10% per annum. The Notes mature on various
dates through January 25, 2016. The Notes may be converted into shares of the Company s common stock at conversion prices
ranging from the lesser of $0.06 to $0.14 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends, combinations and other similar transactions)
or 50% of the lowest trade price on any trade day following issuance of the Notes. The Notes include customary default provisions
related to payment of principal and interest and bankruptcy or creditor assignment. In the event of default, the Notes shall become
immediately due and payable at the mandatory default amount. The mandatory default amount is 150% of the Note amount and such
mandatory default amount shall bear interest at 10% per annum. In addition, for as long as the Notes or other convertible notes
in effect between the purchaser and the Company are outstanding, if the Company issues any security with terms more favorable
than the terms of the Notes or such other convertible notes or a term was not similarly provided to the purchaser of the Notes
or such other convertible notes, then such more favorable or additional term shall, at the purchaser s option, become part
of the Notes and such other convertible notes. The conversion feature of the Notes was considered a derivative in accordance with
current accounting guidelines because of the reset conversion features of the Notes. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding
principal balance was $2,535,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 93,866,797 shares of common
stock upon conversion of $518,000 in aggregate principal, plus accrued interest of $96,040. As of September 30, 2016, the Notes
had an aggregate remaining balance of $2,017,000. The Company recorded amortization of debt discount, which was recognized as
interest expense in the amount of $1,691 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On February 24, 2015, the
unsecured convertible promissory notes (the  OID Notes ), with an aggregate remaining principle balance of $273,124,
plus accrued interest of $13,334 were amended. The OID Notes included an original issue discount and one time interest, which has
been fully amortized. The OID Notes were extended and matured on various dates through September 19, 2014. On each maturity date,
each note was extended one year from its maturity date through September 19, 2015. On February 24, 2015, the Notes were amended
and have a maturity date of December 31, 2015. The Notes were analyzed under ASC 470  (Extinguishment   Modification of debt)
 to determine if there was a 10% change between the fair value of the embedded conversion option immediately before and after
the modification or exchange. The change of the fair value of the conversion feature was greater than 10% of the carrying value
of the debt. As a result, in accordance with ASC 470-50, the Company deemed the terms of the amendment to be substantially different
and treated the convertible note as an extinguishment. The OID Notes were convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock at a conversion price initially of $0.4375. After the amendment the conversion price changed to the lesser of $0.08 per share,
or b) fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trade price of common stock recorded since the original effective date of this note, or
c) the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity after the effective date. On May 19, 2015, a holder of
a note with a more favorable term converted a note at a price of $0.02, which became part of this note due to the reset provision
mentioned above. The conversion feature of the notes was considered a derivative in accordance with current accounting guidelines
because of the reset conversion features of the notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 10,470,588
shares of common stock upon partial conversion of principal in the amount of $89,000, leaving a remaining balance of $184,124. 

The
Company entered into various unsecured convertible Notes (the  Convertible Promissory Notes  or  Notes ),
for an aggregate amount of $1,900,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has received advances in the aggregate of $1,325,000.
The notes matured between nine and twelve months from the date of issuance of each advance and bears interest at 10% per annum.
The Notes were extended and mature on various dates ending on May 31, 2017. The Notes may be converted into shares of the Company s
common stock at conversion prices ranging from the lesser of $0.02 to $0.08 (subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends,
combinations and other similar transactions) or 50% of the lowest trade price on any trade day following issuance of the Notes.
The Notes include customary default provisions related to payment of principal and interest and bankruptcy or creditor assignment.
In the event of default, the Notes shall become immediately due and payable at the mandatory default amount. The mandatory default
amount is 150% of the Note amount and such mandatory default amount shall bear interest at 10% per annum. In addition, for as
long as the Notes or other convertible notes in effect between the purchaser and the Company are outstanding, if the Company issues
any security with terms more favorable than the terms of the Notes or such other convertible notes or a term was not similarly
provided to the purchaser of the Notes or such other convertible notes, then such more favorable or additional term shall, at
the purchaser s option, become part of the Notes and such other convertible notes. The conversion feature of the Notes was
considered a derivative in accordance with current accounting guidelines because of the reset conversion features of the Notes.
The Company recorded amortization of debt discount, which was recognized as interest expense in the amount of $96,104 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.

6.  
      DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

We
evaluated the financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the conversion
feature of the convertible promissory note was not afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments due to its
variable conversion rate. The note has no explicit limit on the number of shares issuable so they did not meet the conditions
set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. The Company elected to recognize the note under paragraph
815-15-25-4, whereby, there would be a separation into a host contract and derivative instrument. The Company elected to initially
and subsequently measure the note in its entirety at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The derivative
liability is adjusted periodically according to the stock price fluctuations.  

For purpose of determining the fair market
value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion, the Company used the Binomial Lattice valuation model. The
significant assumptions used in the Binomial Lattice formula valuation of the derivative are as follows: 

The
derivative liability recognized in the financial statements as of September 30, 2016 was $12,189,026

Overview
of Business   

OriginClear
is a leading provider of water treatment solutions and the developer of a breakthrough water cleanup technology. Through its wholly
owned subsidiaries, OriginClear provides systems and services to treat water in a wide range of industries, such as municipal,
pharmaceutical, semiconductors, industrial, and oil   gas. To rapidly grow this segment of the business, we strategically
acquire profitable and well-managed water treatment companies, which allow us to expand our global market presence and technical
expertise. To enable a new era of clean and socially responsible water treatment solutions, we invented Electro Water Separation ,
a breakthrough high-speed water cleanup technology using multi-stage electrochemistry that we license worldwide to water treatment
equipment manufacturers. Water is our most valuable resource, and the mission of The OriginClear Group  is to improve the
quality of water and help return it to its original and clear condition.  

The
Group    

Outsourcing
is a fast-growing reality in water treatment. Tougher regulations, water scarcities and general outsourcing trends are driving
industrial and agricultural water treatment users to delegate their water problem to service providers. As Global Water Intelligence
pointed out in their report on October 30, 2015,   Water is often perceived as a secondary importance, with end-users
increasingly wanting to focus solely on their own core business. This is driving a move away from internal water personnel towards
external service experts to take control of water aspects.   External service experts are typically small privately
owned and locally operated. Consolidating these companies could lead to enormous economies of scale through sharing of best practices,
technologies, and customers. Again, Global Water Intelligence report, dated May 8, 2014 indicated,    the market
is incredibly fragmented There needs to be some sort of aggregation of customers before it becomes a truly good business. 
 Therefore, OriginClear is assembling a group of such water treatment companies to create an opportunity for significant growth
and increased company value for the stockholders.  

Progressive
Water Treatment    

On
October 1, 2015, Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment, Inc. ( PWT ) became the first company in The OriginClear
Group. PWT is profitable and is a fast-growing designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment
applications. PWT reported revenue of $4,831,788 in 2015, of which $773,699 was included in the consolidated financial statements
for period ending December 31, 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, PWT reported revenue of $4,070,136 which is included in
the consolidated financial statements ending September 30, 2016.  

PWT s
Business    

Since 1995, PWT
of McKinney, Texas has been designing and manufacturing a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and
pure water applications. Known as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), PWT utilizes a wide range of technologies, including
chemical injection, media filters, membrane, ion exchange and SCADA technology that it integrates into turnkey systems that it
designs and builds. The Company also offers a broad range of services including maintenance contracts, retrofits and replacement
assistance. In addition, PWT rents equipment in contracts of varying duration. Customers are primarily served in the United States
and Canada, with the Company s reach extending worldwide from Japan to Argentina to the Middle East. As OriginClear s
technology matures and enters commercial distribution channels, PWT intends to integrate it into applicable field situations, such
as clarifying very oily, turbid water prior to processing with filters and membranes. 

OriginClear
is currently in discussions for additional, accretive acquisitions of companies specializing in complementary markets and applications.  

Technology
Licensing    

For its first eight
years of existence, OriginClear focused uniquely on development and commercialization of its breakthrough Electro Water Separation 
technology. In 2015, the Company established the OriginClear Technologies division, operating in parallel to the OriginClear Group.
The mission of OriginClear Technologies is to develop Electro Water Separation  and achieve its full recognition as an international
industry standard in treating our increasingly complex wastewater treatment challenges. For this purpose, OriginClear Technologies
relies on an ongoing strong R D and engineering activity for the development of its technology, while actively building its
network of partners, licensees and joint venture partners for commercial development. A key element of this strategy is OriginClear
Technologies, Inc., (previously OriginClear (HK)), OriginClear s wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong that manages Asia-Pacific
market development, with a special focus on China sales and manufacturing. While OriginClear Technologies focuses on developing
and monetizing the Company s internally-developed Intellectual Property, best practices and trade secrets, it is expected
to do the same for technologies which may come in the future with OriginClear Group s acquisition of profitable water treatment
companies. 

The
Technology    

OriginClear
is the proprietary developer of Electro Water Separation  (EWS), the high-speed, primarily chemical-free technology to clean
up large quantities of water. It removes oils, suspended solids, certain dissolved solids, and pathogens, in a continuous and
energy-efficient process. The Company originally developed this technology to solve the challenge of removing microalgae from
a highly dilute state. The EWS technology remains an efficient mechanism for the concentration of live algae cells from water.
The electro-chemical process was then extended, first to cleaning up oil and gas waste water and most recently, to industrial,
agricultural and urban effluents. EWS is designed to be an early step in removal of oils, solids and pathogens; reducing the work
that more expensive, downstream processes such as Ultra Filtration or Reverse Osmosis must do, therefore enabling more cost-efficient
and high-volume water cleanup overall.  

EWS,
combined with an iSep ultrafiltration membrane, has demonstrated up to a 99.9% removal of dispersed oil, 99.5% removal of suspended
solids as well as successful treatment of chemical oxygen demand (COD), including specific contaminants such as ammonia, phosphorus
and hydrogen sulfide. These results were presented at the International Water Conference in 2015.  

In
March of 2016, OriginClear announced that it had successfully developed and proved Advanced Oxidation as the last stage of EWS.
University laboratory tests have shown that EWS with Advanced Oxidation (EWS:AOx ) can now extract certain dissolved contaminants,
which are otherwise difficult to remove without chemicals such as chlorine. Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction
in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent
global discharge requirements. In 2016, OriginClear filed for a patent to protect the new AOx process and system configuration.
Our technology integrates easily with other industry processes and we have begun to embed our technology into larger systems through
licensing and joint ventures.  

Beginning
in July of 2016, OriginClear participated in a 60-day pilot test of a system which incorporated its technology. The client was
an organization which specializes in the treatment of Produced water in Kern County. In May 2016, the client agreed to implement
a 60-day pilot test of a multi-step produced water treatment system that culminates in reverse osmosis. The pilot treatment system
would be designed and installed with the intent that the treated water would meet Proposition 65 safe harbor levels and any applicable
specifications. On July 20, 2016, the client commenced the pilot test of the multi-step produced water treatment system which
was provided by ECT Ser-vices   Solutions, under license from OriginClear. After an initial commissioning period, the pilot
demonstrated the ability to safely and reliably treat the produced water to below the limits contained in the treated water specifications.
When the complete system was fully operational its energy consumption was roughly 20kWh for 30 bbl of water per hour with a reject
rate of 25% or 23 bbl/hour. This translated to about 1 kWh per barrel treated. At 15 cents per kWh this cost is approximatively
15-20 cents per 42-gallon barrel.  

Additional
Information   

On October 17, 2016
(the  Grant Date ), the Company entered into a Consultant Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement (the  Option Agreement )

cash consideration.  

The securities above
were offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) since, among other things, the transactions did not involve a public offering
and the securities were acquired for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof.  

On November 1, 2016,
the Company received a notice from the OTCQB Marketplace (the  OTCQB ) advising the Company that its bid price has
closed below $0.01 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days and no longer meets the Standards for Continued Eligibility for OTCQB
as per the OTCQB standards. Pursuant to the OTCQB standards, the Company has been granted a period of 180 calendar days in which
to regain compliance with Section 2.3, or until April 30, 2017. If, at that time, the Company s bid price has not closed
at or above $0.01 for any ten consecutive trading days then the security will be removed from the OTCQB marketplace. 

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) defines  critical accounting policies  as those that require application
of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all of the accounting policies require management
to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. However, the following policies could be deemed to be critical
within the SEC definition.    

Revenue
Recognition     

Equipment
sales    

  We
recognize revenue upon delivery of equipment, provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, title, and risk of loss have passed
to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.  Title
to the equipment is transferred to the customer once the last payment is received. We record revenue as goods are shipped, and
the equipment has been fully accepted by the customer. Generally, we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral. We
do not ship a product until we have a purchase agreement signed by the customer with a payment arrangement.    

Percentage
of completion    

  Revenues
and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the  percentage of completion method  of accounting
in accordance with ASC 605-35     Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts .
 Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct
proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct
material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general
and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company
will recognize the loss as it is determined.  

The
asset  Costs in excess of billings  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress.
The liability  Billings in excess of costs  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in progress.
Assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts are included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying
balance sheets, as they will be liquidated in the normal course of the contract completion.  

Revisions
in cost and profit estimates during the course of the contract are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts for the
revisions become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty
provisions, and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, which are recognized in the period the
revisions are determined.  

Use
of Estimates     

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing
these financial statements include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance,
and the fair value of stock options, warrants, convertible notes and common stock for services. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments     

Fair
value of financial instruments requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet,
where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.    

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

Management
reviewed accounting pronouncements issued during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and no pronouncements were believed
by management to have a material impact on our present or future financial statements.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts
receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company has not generated significant revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash
infusion. We obtained funds from our shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Management believes the existing
shareholders, the prospective new investors and future sales will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s
obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of its core business operations. No assurance can be given that
any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if
the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing,
or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash of $867,661 and $695,295, respectively and working capital deficit of $15,348,850
and $13,471,476, respectively.  The increase in working capital deficit was due primarily to derivative liabilities and convertible
promissory notes, an increase in cash, cost in excess of billing and accrued expenses with a decrease in contracts receivable,
work in process, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, billing in excess of cost, and deferred income.  

During
the nine months of 2016, we raised an aggregate of $125,000 in an offering of unsecured convertible notes, and $963,217 through
private placements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions and
future revenue.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $910,146 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,350,071 for the prior
period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was due to a decrease in net loss due to the
acquisition of PWT.  

Net
cash flows used in investing activities was $5,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $45,168 for the
prior period ended September 30, 2015. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to less equipment purchased
in the current period.  

Net
cash flows provided by financing activities was $1,088,217 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,135,732
for the prior period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due to a decrease in
debt financing offset by an increase in equity financing. To date we have principally financed our operations through the sale
of our common stock and the issuance of debt.  

We
do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures during the next twelve months.  Although our proceeds
from the issuance of convertible debt together with revenue from operations are currently sufficient to fund our operating
expenses, we will need to raise additional funds in the future so that we can expand our operations. Therefore,
our future operations are dependent on our ability to secure additional financing.  Financing transactions may
include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading
price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing
through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could
incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements
that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders
may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of
existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce
our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to curtail
our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.  

We
have estimated our current average burn, and believe that we have assets to ensure that we can function without liquidation over
the next twelve months, due to our cash on hand, growing revenue, and our ability to raise money from our investor base. Based
on the aforesaid, we believe we have the ability to continue our operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize
assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.  

Item
3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

Item
4.  Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Pursuant
to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer ( CEO/CFO ) of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures , as defined under Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
disclosed in our annual report filing for the year ended December 31, 2015, there was a material weakness in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting due to the fact that the Company had a lack of segregation of duties and failure to implement
accounting controls of acquired businesses. Based upon the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures at the end of
the period covered by this report, the Company's CEO/CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective due to a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  

To
address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this review report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the first nine months of 2016 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting .   

Limitations
on Internal Controls   

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
