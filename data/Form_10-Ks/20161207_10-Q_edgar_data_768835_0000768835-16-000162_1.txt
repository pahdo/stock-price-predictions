NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  All references in this report to  we,   us,  or  our  are to Big Lots, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  We are a unique, non-traditional, discount retailer operating in the United States of America ( U.S. ).  At   October 29, 2016  , we operated   1,442   stores in   47   states and the District of Columbia.  We make available, free of charge, through the  Investor Relations  section of our website (  www.biglots.com  ) under the  SEC Filings  caption, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The contents of our websites are not part of this report. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and these notes have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial information.  The consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which management believes are necessary to present fairly our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented.  These consolidated financial statements, however, do not include all information necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  Interim results may not necessarily be indicative of results that may be expected for, or actually result during, any other interim period or for the year as a whole.  We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and these notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   ( 2015 Form 10-K ). 
    
  Fiscal Periods 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which results in fiscal years consisting of   52 or 53 weeks  .  Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.  Fiscal year   2016   (   2016   ) is comprised of the 52 weeks that began on January 31, 2016 and will end on   January 28, 2017  .  Fiscal year   2015   (   2015   ) was comprised of the 52 weeks that began on February 1, 2015 and ended on   January 30, 2016  .  The fiscal quarters ended   October 29, 2016   (   third   quarter of   2016   ) and   October 31, 2015   (   third   quarter of   2015   ) were both comprised of 13 weeks.  The year-to-date periods ended   October 29, 2016   ( year-to-date   2016   ) and   October 31, 2015   ( year-to-date   2015   ) were both comprised of 39 weeks.  
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses include store expenses (such as payroll and occupancy costs) and costs related to warehousing, distribution, outbound transportation to our stores, advertising, purchasing, insurance, non-income taxes, and overhead.  Our selling and administrative expense rates may not be comparable to those of other retailers that include distribution and outbound transportation costs in cost of sales.  Distribution and outbound transportation costs included in selling and administrative expenses were   $38.2 million   and   $41.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015  , respectively, and   $111.3 million   and   $120.3 million   for the year-to-date   2016   and the year-to-date   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Advertising Expense 
  Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of television and print advertising, digital or internet marketing and advertising, and in-store point-of-purchase presentations.  Advertising expenses are included in selling and administrative expenses.  Advertising expenses were   $15.6 million   and   $15.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015  , respectively, and   $52.3 million   and   $53.7 million   for the year-to-date   2016   and the year-to-date   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Derivative Instruments 
  We use derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations in diesel fuel prices.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  Our derivative instruments may consist of collar or swap contracts.  Our current derivative instruments do not meet the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting.  Instead, our derivative instruments are marked-to-market to determine their fair value and any gains or losses are recognized currently in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.

Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures 
  The following table provides supplemental cash flow information for the year-to-date   2016   and the year-to-date   2015  : 

Reclassifications 
  Merchandise Categories 
  We periodically assess, and make minor adjustments to, our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up of our merchandise categories.  Our financial reporting process utilizes the most current product hierarchy in reporting net sales by merchandise category for all periods presented.  Therefore, there may be minor reclassifications of net sales by merchandise category compared to previously reported amounts. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, this guidance expands related disclosure requirements. The pronouncement was originally set to be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date from December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, but will allow for early adoption as of December 15, 2016. This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as the expected adoption method.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing a right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update makes several modifications to the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the requirement to recognize the income tax effects of awards that vest or settle as income tax expense. Additionally, this update clarifies the presentation of certain components of share-based awards in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2   BANK CREDIT FACILITY 
    
  On July 22, 2011, we entered into a   $700 million     five  -year unsecured credit facility, which was first amended on May 30, 2013.  On May 28, 2015, we entered into an additional amendment of the credit facility that among other things extended its expiration date to May 30, 2020 (as amended, the  2011 Credit Agreement ). 
    
  Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes and working capital.  The 2011 Credit Agreement includes a   $30 million   swing loan sublimit and a   $150 million   letter of credit sublimit.  The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2011 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating.  The 2011 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from multiple interest rate options.  The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR.  We may prepay revolving loans made under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  The 2011 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios   a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2011 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2011 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  At   October 29, 2016  , we had   $362.9 million   of borrowings outstanding under the 2011 Credit Agreement and   $7.7 million   was committed to outstanding letters of credit, leaving   $329.4 million   available under the 2011 Credit Agreement.   

NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  In connection with our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, we had mutual fund investments of   $22.9 million   and   $17.3 million   at   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively, which were recorded in other assets.  These investments were classified as trading securities and were recorded at their fair value.  The fair values of mutual fund investments were Level 1 valuations under the fair value hierarchy because each fund s quoted market value per share was available in an active market. 
    
  The fair values of our long-term obligations are estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for similar instruments.  These fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Given the variable rate features and relatively short maturity of the instruments underlying our long-term obligations, the carrying value of these instruments approximates the fair value. 
    
  The carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of the relatively short maturity of these items. 

NOTE 4   SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
    
  Earnings per Share 
  There were no adjustments required to be made to the weighted-average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share and there were no securities outstanding at   October 29, 2016   or   October 31, 2015   which were excluded from the computation of earnings per share other than antidilutive stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units.  For the   third   quarter of   2016   and the year-to-date 2016, the stock options outstanding that were antidilutive and excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were immaterial.  For the third quarter of 2015 and the year-to-date   2015  ,   0.3 million   and   0.3 million  , respectively, of the stock options outstanding were antidilutive and excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.  Antidilutive stock options generally consist of outstanding stock options where the exercise price per share is greater than the weighted-average market price per share for our common shares for each period.  Antidilutive stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation because they decrease the number of diluted shares outstanding under the treasury stock method.  The restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that were antidilutive, as determined under the treasury stock method, were immaterial for all periods presented. 
    
  Share Repurchase Programs 
  On March 1, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to   $250 million   of our common shares ( 2016 Repurchase Program ).  The 2016 Repurchase Program was exhausted during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  During the year-to-date 2016, we have acquired approximately   5.6 million   of our outstanding common shares for   $250.0 million   under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

Dividends 
  The Company declared and paid cash dividends per common share during the periods presented as follows: 

The amount of dividends declared may vary from the amount of dividends paid in a period based on certain instruments with restrictions on payment, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance share units.  The payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with applicable laws and agreements and any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. 

NOTE 5   SHARE-BASED PLANS 
    
  We have issued nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance share units under our shareholder-approved equity compensation plans.  Our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, as described below and/or in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K, are expensed and reported as nonvested shares.  We recognized share-based compensation expense of   $8.1 million   and   $3.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015  , respectively, and   $24.8 million   and   $10.0 million   for the year-to-date   2016   and the year-to-date   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Non-vested Restricted Stock 
  The following table summarizes the non-vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units activity for the year-to-date   2016  :   

The non-vested restricted stock units granted in the first, second, and third quarters of   2016   generally vest, and are expensed, on a ratable basis over   three   years from the grant date of the award, if certain threshold financial performance objectives are achieved and the grantee remains employed by us through the vesting dates.  

10 

     Table of Contents  

The non-vested restricted stock awards granted in prior years vest if certain financial performance objectives are achieved.  If we meet a threshold financial performance objective and the grantee remains employed by us, the restricted stock will vest on the opening of our first trading window   five   years after the grant date of the award.  If we meet a higher financial performance objective and the grantee remains employed by us, the restricted stock will vest on the first trading day after we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC for the fiscal year in which the higher objective is met.   
    
  As of January 31, 2015, we estimated a   five  -year period for vesting, and therefore expensing, of all non-vested restricted stock awards granted in prior years, as we do not anticipate achieving the higher financial performance objective for any outstanding grants. 
    
  Non-vested Stock Awards to Non-Employee Directors 
  In the second quarter of   2016  ,   19,104   common shares underlying the restricted stock awards granted in   2015   to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors vested on the trading day immediately preceding our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. These awards were part of the annual compensation granted in   2015   to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors.  Additionally, in the second quarter of   2016  , each non-employee elected to our Board of Directors at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders received an annual restricted stock award having a grant date fair value of approximately   $110,000  .  The 2016 restricted stock awards will vest on the earlier of (1) the trading day immediately preceding our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or (2) the non-employee director s death or disability.  However, the restricted stock award will not vest if the non-employee director ceases to serve on our Board of Directors before either vesting event occurs. 
    
  Performance Share Units 
  In 2013, in connection with his appointment as CEO and President, Mr. David J. Campisi was awarded   37,800   performance share units ( PSUs ).  Mr. Campisi s PSU award fully vested during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  In the year-to-date 2016, we issued PSUs to certain members of management, which vest if certain financial performance objectives are achieved over a   three  -year performance period and the grantee remains employed by us during that period.  At   October 29, 2016  ,   971,595   nonvested PSUs were outstanding in the aggregate.  The financial performance objectives for each fiscal year within the three-year performance period are approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors during the first quarter of the respective fiscal year.   
    
  As a result of the process used to establish the financial performance objectives, we will only meet the requirements of establishing a grant date for the PSUs when we communicate the financial performance objectives for the third fiscal year of the award to the award recipients, which will then trigger the service inception date, the fair value of the awards, and the associated expense recognition period. If we meet the applicable threshold financial performance objectives over the three-year performance period and the grantee remains employed by us through the end of the performance period, the PSUs will vest on the first trading day after we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year in the performance period.   
    
  We have begun or expect to begin recognizing expense related to PSUs as follows: 

The number of shares to be distributed upon vesting of the PSUs depends on our average performance attained during the three-year performance period as compared to the targets defined by the Compensation Committee, and may result in the distribution of an amount of shares that is greater or less than the number of PSUs granted, as defined in the award agreement.  At   October 29, 2016  , we estimate the attainment of an average performance that is greater than the targets established for the PSUs issued in 2014.  In the year-to-date 2016, we recognized $  13.1 million   in share-based compensation expense related to PSUs.

Stock Options 
  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year-to-date   2016  : 

The stock options granted in prior years vest in equal amounts on the first   four   anniversaries of the grant date and have a contractual term of   seven   years.  The number of stock options expected to vest was based on our annual forfeiture rate assumption.

The total unearned compensation cost related to all share-based awards outstanding, excluding PSUs issued in 2015 and 2016, at   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $21.3 million  .  This compensation cost is expected to be recognized through January 2019 based on existing vesting terms with the weighted-average remaining expense recognition period being approximately   1.4   years from   October 29, 2016  . 

NOTE 6   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  Through January 31, 2016, we maintained a qualified defined benefit pension plan ( Pension Plan ) and a nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plan ( Supplemental Pension Plan ) covering certain employees whose hire date occurred before April 1, 1994.  On October 31, 2015, our Board of Directors approved amendments to freeze benefits and terminate the Pension Plan.  The Pension Plan discontinued accruing benefits on December 31, 2015 and the termination was effective January 31, 2016.  On December 2, 2015, our Board of Directors approved amendments to freeze benefits and terminate the Supplemental Pension Plan.  The Supplemental Pension Plan discontinued accruing benefits on December 31, 2015 and the termination was effective December 31, 2015.  We expect to complete the termination of the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan by January 28, 2017. The pension liability has been and will be settled through either lump sum payments or purchased annuities. 
    
  The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost for our plans were as follows: 

The components of combined net periodic pension cost were as follows: 

During the year-to-date 2016, we recognized a settlement loss of $1.6 million, which was driven by terminated vested participants electing to receive lump sum payments.  If we are able to complete the full distribution of the pension plans during 2016, we will recognize the remaining unrecognized actuarial loss, or   $23.1 million   as of October 29, 2016, into income through settlement charges in 2016. 
    
  As a result of the termination of our Pension Plan, we considered the financial benefit, such as reduced regulatory fees, of making a voluntary contribution to the Pension Plan.  During the third quarter of 2016, we made a voluntary contribution of   $5.8 million   to the Pension Plan.  We currently expect to fund our entire pension liability, or   $13.2 million  , during the next 12 months as a result of the plan terminations.

NOTE 7   INCOME TAXES 
    
  We have estimated the reasonably possible expected net change in unrecognized tax benefits through October 28, 2017, based on 1) expected cash and noncash settlements or payments of uncertain tax positions, and 2) lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations for unrecognized tax benefits.  The estimated net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the next 12 months is approximately   $5.0 million  .  Actual results may differ materially from this estimate. 

NOTE 8   CONTINGENCIES 
    
  On May 21, May 22 and July 2, 2012,   three   shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against us and certain of our current and former outside directors and executive officers.  The lawsuits were consolidated, and, on August 13, 2012, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint captioned   In re Big Lots, Inc. Shareholder Litigation  , No. 2:12-cv-00445 (S.D. Ohio) (the  Consolidated Derivative Action ), which generally alleged that the individual defendants traded in our common shares based on material, nonpublic information concerning our guidance for fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the director defendants failed to suspend our share repurchase program during such trading activity.  The consolidated complaint asserted claims under Ohio law for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of trade secrets and corporate waste and sought declaratory relief and disgorgement to us of proceeds from any wrongful sales of our common shares, plus attorneys  fees and expenses. 
    
  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, which was granted by the Court in an Opinion and Order dated April 14, 2015, pursuant to which plaintiffs  claims were all dismissed with prejudice, with the exception of their claim for corporate waste, which was dismissed without prejudice. On May 5, 2015, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to File Verified Consolidated Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint, which sought to replead the claim for corporate waste that was dismissed without prejudice by the Court, as well as a Motion for Reconsideration and, in the Alternative, for Certification of Question of State Law to the Supreme Court of Ohio. Defendants  responses to both motions were filed on May 29, 2015. On August 3, 2015, the Court granted Plaintiffs  Motion for Leave to File Verified Consolidated Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint, and Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint on the same date, asserting a claim for corporate waste against Jeffrey Berger, Steven Fishman, David Kollat, Brenda Lauderback, Philip Mallott, Russell Solt, and Dennis Tishkoff. On September 30, 2015, defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint. The case is currently in discovery. 
    
  We received a letter dated January 28, 2013, sent on behalf of a shareholder demanding that our Board of Directors investigate and take action in connection with the allegations made in the derivative and securities lawsuits described above. The shareholder indicated that he would commence a derivative lawsuit if our Board of Directors failed to take the demanded action. On March 6, 2013, our Board of Directors referred the shareholder s letter to a committee of independent directors to investigate the matter. That committee, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, investigated the allegations in the shareholder s demand letter and, on August 28, 2013, reported its findings to our Board of Directors along with its recommendation that the Board reject the shareholder s demand. Our Board of Directors unanimously accepted the recommendation of the demand investigation committee and, on September 9, 2013, outside counsel for the committee sent a letter to counsel for the shareholder informing the shareholder of the Board s determination. On October 18, 2013, the shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit captioned   Brosz v. Fishman et al.  , No. 1:13-cv-00753 (S.D. Ohio) (the  Brosz Action ) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against us and each of the current and former outside directors and executive officers originally named in the 2012 shareholder derivative lawsuit. The plaintiff s complaint generally alleged that the individual defendants traded in our common shares based on material, nonpublic information concerning our guidance for fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the director defendants failed to suspend our share repurchase program during such trading activity. The complaint asserted claims under Ohio law for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste and misappropriation of trade secrets and sought damages, injunctive relief and disgorgement to us of proceeds from any wrongful sales of our common shares, plus attorneys  fees and expenses. 
    
  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted by the Court in an Opinion and Order dated April 14, 2015, which dismissed the plaintiff s claims with prejudice with the exception of his claim for corporate waste and his assertion that our Board of Directors wrongfully rejected his demand to take action against the individually named defendants. On May 5, 2015, the Court so ordered the parties  stipulation, staying plaintiff s time to seek leave to amend his complaint in order to make a request to inspect the Company s books and records pursuant to Ohio Revised Code  1701.37, and plaintiff served that request for inspection on May 8, 2015. On August 17, 2015 plaintiff filed an Amended Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint. On September 30, 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of November 20, 2015 the motion was fully briefed and awaits decision.

On February 10, 2014, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court in Columbus, Ohio, captioned   Tremblay v. Campisi et al.  , No. 14CV-02-1421 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl., Franklin Cnty.) (the  Tremblay Action ), against us and certain of our current and former outside directors and executive officers (David Campisi, Steven Fishman, Joe Cooper, Charles Haubiel, Timothy Johnson, Robert Claxton, John Martin, Norman Rankin, Paul Schroeder, Robert Segal, Steven Smart, David Kollat, Jeffrey Berger, James Chambers, Peter Hayes, Brenda Lauderback, Philip Mallott, Russell Solt, James Tener and Dennis Tishkoff). The plaintiff s complaint generally alleges that the individual defendants traded in our common shares based on material, nonpublic information concerning our guidance for fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the director defendants failed to suspend our share repurchase program during such trading activity. The complaint also alleges that we and various individual defendants made false and misleading statements regarding our Canadian operations prior to our announcement on December 5, 2013 that we were exiting the Canadian market. The complaint asserts claims under Ohio law for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of insider information and seeks damages, injunctive relief and disgorgement to us of proceeds from any wrongful sales of our common shares, plus attorneys  fees and expenses. At the parties  request, the court has stayed this lawsuit until after the judge in the federal derivative lawsuits discussed in the preceding paragraphs has ruled on the motions to dismiss pending in those actions. 
    
  On August 1, 2016, our Board of Directors passed a resolution creating a special litigation committee ( SLC ) to conduct an independent investigation and determine, in its sole discretion, whether it is in the best interests of the Company to pursue the claims asserted in the Consolidated Derivative Action, the Brosz Action, and the Tremblay Action. The SLC is composed of three members, each of whom is a director that is not a party to any of the derivative actions and was not a member of the Board until well after the relevant time period. The SLC has retained independent counsel and is actively proceeding with its investigation. On October 20, 2016, the Company filed motions to stay all proceedings in the Consolidated Derivative Action and the Brosz Action pending the completion of the SLC s investigation. 
    
  On July 9, 2012, a putative securities class action lawsuit captioned   Willis, et al. v. Big Lots, Inc., et al.  , 2:12-cv-00604 (S.D. Ohio) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on behalf of persons who acquired our common shares between February 2, 2012 and April 23, 2012. This lawsuit was filed against us, Lisa Bachmann, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Fishman and Mr. Haubiel. The complaint in the putative class action generally alleges that the defendants made statements concerning our financial performance that were false or misleading. The complaint asserts claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 and seeks damages in an unspecified amount, plus attorneys  fees and expenses. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 4, 2013, which added Mr. Johnson as a defendant, removed Ms. Bachmann as a defendant, and extended the putative class period to August 23, 2012.  On May 6, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the putative class action complaint. On January 21, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants  motion to dismiss, allowing some claims to move forward.  The case is currently in discovery. On May 27, 2016, the lead plaintiff moved for class certification (requesting a class period from March 2, 2012 through August 23, 2012) and to appoint class representatives and class counsel. Defendants opposed the motion and it remains before the Court. 
    
  We believe that the shareholder derivative and putative class action lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against the allegations levied in these lawsuits.  While a loss from these lawsuits is reasonably possible, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any loss that may result or whether the lawsuits will have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  On October 1, 2013, we received a subpoena from the District Attorney for the County of Alameda, State of California, seeking information concerning our handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste in the State of California.  We have provided information and are cooperating with the authorities from multiple counties and cities in California in connection with this ongoing matter.  In March of 2016, we entered into settlement negotiations related to this matter.   
    
  Overall, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded accruals totaling   $4.7 million   associated with pending legal and regulatory matters.  
    
  In 2013, we sold certain tabletop torch and citronella products manufactured by a third party.  In August 2013, we recalled the products and discontinued their sale in our stores.  In 2014, we were named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits relating to these products alleging personal injuries suffered as a result of negligent shelving and pairing of the products, product design, manufacturing and marketing defects and/or breach of warranties.

Although we believe that we are entitled to indemnification from the third-party manufacturer of the products for all of the expenses that we have incurred (and may in the future incur) with respect to these matters and that these expenses are covered by our insurance (subject to a   $1 million   deductible), in the second quarter of 2015, we (1) determined that our ability to obtain any recovery from the manufacturer may be limited because, among other things, the manufacturer has exhausted its applicable insurance coverage, is domiciled outside the United States and has been dissolved by its parent and (2) became engaged in litigation with our excess insurance carrier regarding the scope of our coverage.  In the second quarter of 2015, we settled   one   of the lawsuits and settled another lawsuit in the third quarter of 2015.    Two   additional lawsuits remain pending against Big Lots in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, respectively.  Both of the outstanding lawsuits are in discovery.  Additionally, we have brought a separate lawsuit in the United States District Court of Massachusetts against the company that tested the product.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a   $4.5 million   charge related to these matters.  
    
  We are involved in other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  We currently believe that each such action and claim will be resolved without a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, litigation involves an element of uncertainty.  Future developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 

NOTE 9   BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA 
    
  We use the following seven merchandise categories, which match our internal management and reporting of merchandise net sales: Food, Consumables, Soft Home, Hard Home, Furniture, Seasonal, and Electronics   Accessories. The Food category includes our beverage   grocery, candy   snacks, and specialty foods departments. The Consumables category includes our health and beauty, plastics, paper, chemical, and pet departments. The Soft Home category includes our home d cor, frames, fashion bedding, utility bedding, bath, window, decorative textile, and area rugs departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances, table top, food preparation, stationery, greeting cards, and home maintenance departments. The Furniture category includes our upholstery, mattress, ready-to-assemble, and case goods departments. The Seasonal category includes our lawn   garden, summer, Christmas, toys, and other holiday departments. The Electronics   Accessories category includes our electronics, jewelry, apparel, hosiery, and infant accessories departments. 
    
  We periodically assess, and potentially enact minor adjustments to, our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up of our merchandise categories. Our financial reporting process utilizes the most current product hierarchy in reporting net sales by merchandise category for all periods presented. Therefore, there may be minor reclassifications of net sales by merchandise category compared to previously reported amounts. 
    
  The following table presents net sales data by merchandise category:

NOTE 11   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  We may enter into derivative instruments designed to mitigate certain risks, including collar contracts to mitigate our risk associated with market fluctuations in diesel fuel prices.  These contracts are used strictly to limit our risk exposure and not as speculative transactions.  Our derivative instruments associated with diesel fuel do not meet the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting.  Therefore, our derivative instruments associated with diesel fuel will be marked-to-market to determine their fair value and the associated gains and losses will be recognized currently in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Our outstanding derivative instrument contracts for the   third   quarter of   2016   were comprised of the following: 

The fair value of our outstanding derivative instrument contracts was as follows: 

The effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations was as follows:

  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
    
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the  Act ) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. We wish to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions of the Act. 
    
  Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act, and such statements are intended to qualify for the protection of the safe harbor provided by the Act. The words  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   objective,   goal,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will,   should,   may,   target,   forecast,   guidance,   outlook,  and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, strategies, plans, goals or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to the expectations of management as to future occurrences and trends, including statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events and projected sales, earnings, capital expenditures and business strategy. Forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge, forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, any one or a combination of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Forward-looking statements that we make herein and in other reports and releases are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the current economic and credit conditions, the cost of goods, our inability to successfully execute strategic initiatives, competitive pressures, economic pressures on our customers and us, the availability of brand name closeout merchandise, trade restrictions, freight costs, the risks discussed in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors discussed from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. This report should be read in conjunction with such filings, and you should consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements. 
    
  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our public announcements and SEC filings.

OVERVIEW 
    
  The discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Each term defined in the notes has the same meaning in this item and the balance of this report. 
    
  The following are the results from the   third   quarter of   2016   that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance from the   third   quarter of   2015  : 

Comparable store sales for stores open at least fifteen months, including e-commerce, were flat. 
                 
    Selling and administrative expenses decreased $2.2 million.  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 37.1% of net sales. 
                
    Operating profit rate increased 40 basis points to 0.2%. 
                
    Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.03 per share from a loss of $(0.03) per share. 
                 
    We declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.21 per common share in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share paid in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
       
  See the discussion and analysis below for additional details regarding our operating results. 

STORES 
    
  The following table presents stores opened and closed during the year-to-date   2016   and the year-to-date   2015  : 

We expect to open 9 stores during 2016, which is a reduction from our original expectation of 15 store openings.  We anticipate closing approximately 26 stores during 2016, which will result in approximately 17 net closings which is slightly more than our original expectation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table compares components of our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales at the end of each period:

  Continuing Operations 
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales by merchandise category (in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales) in the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015  , and the change in net sales (in dollars and percentage) and the change in comparable store sales for stores open at least fifteen months plus the results of our e-commerce net sales ( comp  or  comps ) (in percentage) from the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   were as follows: 

We periodically assess, and make minor adjustments to, our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up of our merchandise categories.  Our financial reporting process utilizes the most current product hierarchy in reporting net sales by merchandise category for all periods presented.  Therefore, there may be minor reclassifications of net sales by merchandise category compared to previously reported amounts.

     Table of Contents  

Net sales decreased $11.0 million, or 1.0%, to   $1,105.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $1,116.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease in net sales was principally due to a net decrease of 21 stores since the end of the   third   quarter of   2015  , which decreased net sales by approximately $10.8 million.  Our comps were flat in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Soft Home experienced increases in net sales and comps which were primarily driven by continued broad-based improvement in our product assortment.  The Furniture category experienced positive net sales and comps during the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by strength in our mattress and upholstery departments, which were positively impacted by an expansion of allocated square footage in approximately 50% of our stores during the first quarter of 2016, the performance of our Easy Leasing lease-to-purchase program, and the introduction of a third party, private label credit card offering. The Consumable category experienced flat comps with positive performance in our health, beauty, and cosmetics department due to the introduction of an everyday, branded product program, partially offset by negative comps in our paper department, due to fewer closeout opportunities.  The positive comps in Furniture and Soft Home were partially offset by a decrease in comps in the low single digits in our Seasonal and Food categories and, as expected, larger negative comps in Electronics   Accessories and Hard Home.  The comp decrease in Seasonal was primarily the result of lower levels of summer clearance merchandise and our strategic decision to narrow the assortment and reduce the allotted space to our toys department. Food experienced a decrease in net sales and comps due to merchandising execution and timing of closeout inventory purchases in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The negative comps in Electronics   Accessories were also a result of a reduced product offering from our  edit  activities in the electronics department, as we continue to refine our understanding of where we can be successful in this category.  Hard Home experienced negative comps as a result of a reduction in allocated square footage and the resulting narrowed assortment.   
    
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin dollars increased by $2.0 million, or 0.5%, to   $442.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $440.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to a higher gross margin rate, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $6.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in net sales, which decreased gross margin dollars by $4.3 million.  Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 40.0% in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to 39.4% in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The gross margin rate increase was principally due to a higher initial mark-up in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our higher initial mark-up resulted from lower inbound freight costs as well as favorable merchandise costs. 
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses were   $409.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $412.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease of $2.2 million, or 0.5%, was primarily driven by a reduction in distribution and outbound transportation costs of $2.7 million, a $1.3 million reduction in pension settlement and curtailment charges associated with our decision to terminate our pension plan, coupled with decreases in self-insurance costs of $1.8 million, accrued bonus expense of $1.5 million, and store related payroll of $1.1 million partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation of $5.0 million, and administrative costs to support our e-commerce platform of $2.2 million. The decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs was driven by operational efficiencies generated at our distribution centers and favorable diesel fuel prices on our outbound transportation during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in self-insurance costs was driven by a decreased occurrence of high cost claims within our health benefits program. The decrease in our accrued bonus expense was related to lower performance to our quarterly operating plans as compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2015.  The decrease in store related payroll resulted from a net decrease of 21 stores since the third quarter of 2015.  The increase in share-based compensation expense was driven by performance share units, which had not met the accounting requirements for expensing prior to the first quarter of 2016. The increase in administrative costs to support our e-commerce platform was attributable to the launch of our e-commerce platform near the end of the first quarter of 2016 and, thus, many of these costs were not incurred in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 37.1% for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to 36.9% for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
    
  Depreciation Expense 
  Depreciation expense increased $0.1 million to   $30.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $30.2 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Depreciation expense as a percentage of sales was flat at 2.7% for both the third quarter of 2016 and the   third   quarter of 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $1.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $1.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  We had total average borrowings (including capital leases) of $325.9 million in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to total average borrowings of $292.9 million in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The increase in total average borrowings (including capital leases) was primarily due to an increase of $36.4 million to our average revolving debt balance under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  The increase to our average revolving debt balance was primarily the result of the investments in our 2016 Repurchase Program exceeding our cash inflows from operations during the year-to-date 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
  Other income (expense) was   $0.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $(0.7) million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The change from 2015 to 2016 was driven by a change in pricing trends for diesel fuel.  We recognized unrealized gains on our diesel fuel hedging contracts during the third quarter of 2016, as an increase in current and future projected diesel fuel prices positively impacted the valuation on our hedges. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized unrealized losses due to a decrease in fuel prices, which negatively impacted the valuation of our hedges.  
    
  Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax benefit rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015   for income from continuing operations was 38.7% and 58.5%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective income tax benefit rate was primarily driven by the fact that there was non-discrete income tax expense in the third quarter of 2016 as we experienced a pretax income as compared to a non-discrete income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015 as we experienced a pretax loss.  The non-discrete income tax rate was slightly lower as increased hiring based tax credits exceeded the impact of estimated nondeductible expenses for 2016.  Our net discrete income tax items were comparable as benefits recognized due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and the favorable cumulative effect of the non-discrete rate update offset the decrease in local tax settlements.  

YEAR-TO-DATE   2016   COMPARED TO YEAR-TO-DATE   2015    
    
  Continuing Operations 
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales by merchandise category (in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales) in the   year-to-date     2016   and the   year-to-date     2015  , and the change in net sales (in dollars and percentage) and the change in comps (in percentage) from the   year-to-date     2016   compared to the   year-to-date     2015   were as follows: 

Net sales increased   $14.6 million  , or   0.4%  , to   $3,621.2 million   in the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to   $3,606.6 million   in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase in net sales was principally due to a   1.2%   increase in comps, which increased net sales by $41.6 million, partially offset by the net decrease of 21 stores since the end of the third quarter of   2015  , which decreased net sales by $27.0 million. The Furniture category experienced positive net sales and comps during the year-to-date 2016, primarily driven by strength in our mattress, case goods, and upholstery departments, which were positively impacted by an expansion of allocated square footage in approximately 50% of our stores during the first quarter of 2016, the performance of our Easy Leasing lease-to-purchase program, and the introduction of a third party, private label credit card offering. Soft Home experienced increases in net sales and comps which were primarily driven by continued broad-based improvement in the product assortment, quality and perceived value by our customers

     Table of Contents  

The positive net sales and comps in our Seasonal category were primarily the result of an improved assortment in our lawn   garden and summer departments and a favorable weather pattern in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015, which experienced an extended winter.  Partially offsetting Seasonal s growth in our lawn   garden and summer departments was a reduction in the square footage allocated to the toys department.  The Consumable category experienced flat comps, yet negative net sales, driven by positive comps in our pet department where we introduced an exclusive label offering in 2015 that has continued to grow, partially offset by negative comps in the paper department driven by fewer closeout opportunities. The net sales and total comp increases in Furniture, Soft Home, and Seasonal were partially offset by slightly negative net sales and comps in Food and negative net sales and comps in our Hard Home and Electronics   Accessories categories. The Food category experienced a slight decrease in net sales and comps due to merchandising execution, such as product mix discrepancies, and the timing of closeout inventory purchases. The negative net sales and comps in Electronics   Accessories were a result of a reduced product offering from our  edit  activities in the electronics department, as we continue to refine our understanding of where we can be successful in this category. Hard Home experienced negative net sales and comps as a result of an intentionally narrowed assortment, primarily from a reduction in allocated space during the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect comparable store sales in the range of flat to a 2% increase. 
    
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin dollars increased $26.1 million, or 1.8%, to   $1,446.1 million   for the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to   $1,420.0 million   for the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to an increase in gross margin rate, which increased gross margin dollars by approximately $20.4 million, coupled with an increase in net sales of $14.6 million, which benefited gross margin dollars by approximately $5.7 million.  Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 39.9% in the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to 39.4% in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The gross margin rate increase was principally due to the impact of a higher initial mark-up. Our higher initial mark-up was a product of lower inbound freight costs as well as favorable merchandise costs. 
    
  We expect our gross margin rate will be higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses were   $1,251.9 million   for the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to   $1,246.5 million   for the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase of $5.4 million, or 0.4%, was primarily driven by an increase in share-based compensation of $14.8 million, accruals for legal settlements of $5.3 million, administrative costs to support our e-commerce platform of $7.2 million, partially offset by decreases in distribution and outbound transportation costs of $9.0 million, self-insurance costs of $3.3 million, store related payroll of $2.8 million, and the absence of a $4.5 million loss contingency associated with a merchandise-related legal matter, which occurred during the second quarter of 2015.  The increase in share-based compensation expense was driven by performance share units, which had not met the accounting requirements for expensing prior to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs was driven by operational efficiencies generated at our distribution centers and through our outbound transportation initiatives during the year-to-date 2016 as compared to the year-to-date 2015. During the year-to-date 2016, we incurred $5.0 million in charges related to wage and hour claims brought against us in the State of California associated with both our stores and our distribution center as well as for an action related to our handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste in California.  The increase in administrative costs to support our e-commerce platform was attributable to the launch of our e-commerce platform during the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, many of these costs were not incurred in the year-to-date 2015. The decrease in self-insurance costs was due to a decrease in the occurrence of high cost claims within our general liability program. The decrease in store-related payroll was driven by a net decrease of 21 stores compared to the end of the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were flat at 34.6% for both the   year-to-date     2016   and the   year-to-date     2015  . 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate that our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales will increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.  This anticipated increase is a result of share-based compensation expense from PSUs and the administrative costs to support our recently launched e-commerce platform.

Depreciation Expense 
  Depreciation expense decreased $1.6 million to   $90.8 million   in the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to   $92.4 million   for the   year-to-date     2015  .  The decrease was driven by the reduction in new store spending in 2014 and 2015 as compared to 2010 and 2011, as the initial store construction costs on those stores are completing the depreciation cycle.  This decrease was partially offset by the depreciation of our e-commerce platform, which was placed into service in the first quarter of 2016.  Depreciation expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 10 basis points compared to the   year-to-date     2015  . 
    
  We expect that our depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 will be approximately flat in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015.  Total capital expenditures are forecasted to be approximately $100 million. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $3.8 million   in the   year-to-date     2016  , compared to   $2.7 million   in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase was driven by higher average borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement. We had total average borrowings (including capital leases) of $235.2 million in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to total average borrowings of $171.4 million in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase in total average borrowings (including capital leases) was primarily due to an increase of $64.7 million to our average revolving debt balance under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  The increase to our average revolving debt balance was primarily the result of the investments in our 2016 Repurchase Program exceeding our cash inflows from operations during the year-to-date 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
  Other income (expense) was   $1.0 million   in the year-to-date   2016  , compared to   $(2.4) million   in the year-to-date   2015  .  We recognized unrealized gains on our diesel fuel hedging contracts during the year-to-date 2016, primarily the third quarter of 2016, as an increase in current and future projected diesel fuel prices positively impacted the valuation on our hedges. In the year-to-date 2015, principally the second quarter of 2015, we recognized unrealized losses due to a decrease in fuel prices, which negatively impacted the valuation of our hedges.  
    
  Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax rate for the   year-to-date     2016   and the   year-to-date     2015   for income from continuing operations was     37.7% and 36.3%, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate was principally driven by a net decrease in hiring tax credits (principally federal tax credits related to the immediate prior wage year) that are received in the current year as a substantial amount of these credits accelerated into 2015, a net decrease in settlements and lapses of the statute of limitations, 
  as well as an estimated increase in the amount of nondeductible expenses.  

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  On July 22, 2011, we entered into the 2011 Credit Agreement, which was first amended on May 30, 2013.  On May 28, 2015, we entered into a second amendment of the 2011 Credit Agreement that, among other things, extended its expiration date to May 30, 2020.  Borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement are available for working capital and general corporate purposes.  The 2011 Credit Agreement includes a $30 million swing loan sublimit and a $150 million letter of credit sublimit.  The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2011 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating.  The 2011 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from multiple interest rate options.  The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR.  We may prepay revolving loans made under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  The 2011 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios   a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2011 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2011 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  At   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2011 Credit Agreement. 
    
  The primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and, as necessary, borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our net sales are typically highest during the nine-week Christmas selling season in our fourth fiscal quarter. Generally, our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter. We have typically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility.  At   October 29, 2016  , we had   $362.9 million   in outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement and the borrowings available under the 2011 Credit Agreement were   $329.4 million  , after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling   $7.7 million  .

In March 2016, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common shares.  During the year-to-date 2016, we exhausted the 2016 Repurchase Program by purchasing approximately 5.6 million common shares at an average price of $44.72 per share. 
    
  In the year-to-date 2016, we have declared and paid three quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per common share for a total paid amount of approximately $29.2 million. 
    
  In December 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share payable on  
  December 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2016. 

The following table compares the primary components of our cash flows from the   year-to-date     2016   compared to the   year-to-date     2015  : 

Cash provided by operating activities decreased by   $8.8 million   to   $43.5 million   in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $52.3 million   of cash provided by operating activities in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in our income tax payments, which decreased our cash provided by operating activities by $31.6 million in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to the   year-to-date     2015  .  The increase in income tax payments was principally driven by our increase in pretax income in the year-to-date 2016 compared to the year-to-date 2015 and extension payments for 2015 made in 2016.  There were substantially less income tax payments in year-to-date 2015 for 2014 extensions due to the large taxable loss associated with the wind down of our former Canadian operations. Partially offsetting the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in net income of $14.4 million, which was primarily driven by the increase in comparable store sales and an improved operating profit rate in the year-to-date 2016. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities decreased by   $26.5 million   to   $71.8 million   in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $98.3 million   in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The decrease was primarily driven by a $38.9 million decrease in capital expenditures to   $72.1 million   in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $111.0 million   in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The decrease in capital expenditures was driven by fewer capital projects in 2016 as compared to 2015, which included an upgrade in our POS systems and substantial investment in our e-commerce platform.  The decrease in capital expenditures was partially offset by a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of an asset held for sale of $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2015, while no similar transaction has occurred in 2016. 
    
  Cash provided by financing activities decreased by   $21.4 million   to   $33.9 million   in the   year-to-date     2016   compared to   $55.3 million   in the   year-to-date     2015  .  The primary driver of this decrease was a $52.4 million increase in payments for treasury shares acquired to $254.3 million in the year-to-date 2016 from $201.8 million in the year-to-date 2015, partially offset by an increase of $27.8 million in net borrowings under our bank credit facility to $300.6 million in the year-to-date 2016 compared to $272.8 million in the year-to-date 2015. 
    
  On a consolidated basis, we expect cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures to be approximately $195 million for   2016  , which is a decrease of $15 million from previous expectations.  The decrease is the result of our expectation that we will complete the termination of our pension plans, including distribution of assets, in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to completing the distribution of assets in the first quarter of 2017.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, and bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information about our accounting policies. 
    
  The estimates, judgments, and assumptions that have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require the most significant judgments are outlined in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our   2015   Form 10-K.  Had we used estimates, judgments, and assumptions different from any of those discussed in our   2015   Form 10-K, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity for the current period could have been materially different from those presented. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on investments that we make from time to time and on borrowings under the 2011 Credit Agreement.  An increase or decrease of 1% in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
    
  We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in our derivative instruments, associated with diesel fuel.  At October 29, 2016, we had outstanding derivative instruments, in the form of collars, covering   5,425,000   gallons of diesel fuel.  The below table provides further detail related to our current derivative instruments, associated with diesel fuel. 

Additionally, at October 29, 2016, a 1% difference in the forward curve for diesel fuel prices would affect unrealized gains (losses) in other income (expense) by approximately $0.1 million. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Accordingly, please refer to the discussion in note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements regarding our settlement discussions with the State of California. 
    
  Aside from this matter, no response is required under Item 103 of Regulation S-K. For a discussion of certain litigated matters, also see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

(1) 
    In August, September, and October 2016, in connection with the vesting of certain outstanding restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, we acquired 426, 2,633, and 239 of our common shares, respectively, which were withheld to satisfy minimum statutory income tax withholdings.

  CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
  PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
