Note   1       Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Description of Business 
  DPL   is a diversified regional energy company organized in 1985 under the laws of Ohio.    DPL s     one   reportable segment is the Utility segment, comprised of its   DP L   subsidiary.  DPLER, which was   DPL's   competitive retail segment, was sold January 1, 2016.  See   Note 12   Business Segments   for more information relating to these reportable segments.  The terms  we,   us,   our  and  ours  are used to refer to   DPL   and its subsidiaries. 
    
  DPL   is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of AES.  
    
  DP L   is a public utility incorporated in 1911 under the laws of Ohio.  Beginning in 2001, Ohio law gave Ohio consumers the right to choose the electric generation supplier from whom they purchase retail generation service; however, distribution and transmission retail services are still regulated.    DP L   has the exclusive right to provide such distribution and transmission services to approximately   518,000   customers located in West Central Ohio.  Additionally,   DP L   offers retail SSO electric service to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in a     6,000     square mile area of West Central Ohio.    DP L   owns multiple coal-fired and peaking electric generating facilities as well as numerous transmission facilities, all of which are included in the financial statements at amortized cost.    DP L   sources   100%   of the generation for its SSO customers through a competitive bid process.  Principal industries located in   DP L s   service territory include automotive, food processing, paper, plastic, manufacturing and defense.    DP L's   distribution sales reflect the general economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns, retail competition in our service territory and the market price of electricity.    DP L   sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market. 
    
  DPL s   other significant subsidiaries include AES Ohio Generation, which owns and operates peaking generating facilities from which it sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market, and MVIC, our captive insurance company that provides insurance services to   DPL   and our subsidiaries.    DPL   owns all of the common stock of its subsidiaries. 
    
  DPL   also has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II, formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to investors. 
    
  DP L s   electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators while its generation business is deemed competitive under Ohio law.  Accordingly,   DP L   applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates, and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs. 
    
  DPL   and its subsidiaries employed   1,171   people as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   1,163   were employed by   DP L  .  Approximately   62%   of all   DPL   employees are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on   October 31, 2017  .

  DPL s   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of   DPL   and its wholly-owned subsidiaries except for DPL Capital Trust II, which is not consolidated, consistent with the provisions of GAAP.    DP L   has undivided ownership interests in   five   coal-fired generating facilities, various peaking generating 
  facilities and numerous transmission facilities, all of which are included in the financial statements at amortized cost, which was adjusted to fair value at the date of the Merger for   DPL  .  Operating revenues and expenses of these facilities are included on a pro rata basis in the corresponding lines in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Certain immaterial amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements, the instructions of Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally

     Table of Contents  

included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted from this interim report.  Therefore, our interim financial statements in this report should be read along with the annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the opinion of our management, the Condensed   Consolidated   Financial Statements presented in this report contain all adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  ; our results of operations for the   three and nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Unless otherwise noted, all adjustments are normal and recurring in nature.  Due to various factors, including, but not limited to, seasonal weather variations, the timing of outages of EGUs, changes in economic conditions involving commodity prices and competition, and other factors, interim results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of our results that will be realized for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the revenues and expenses of the periods reported.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Significant items subject to such estimates and judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; liabilities recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits. 
    
  As a result of push down accounting,   DPL s   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the Merger include depreciation of fixed assets based upon their fair value at the Merger date. 
    
  Accounting for Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities    
  DP L   collects certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments from its customers.  These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and not included in revenue.    The amounts of such taxes collected for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $14.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively.  The amounts of such taxes collected for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $38.9 million and $38.5 million, respectively.

      2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 
    Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03, this standard clarifies that the SEC Staff would not object to an entity presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset that is subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. Transition method: retrospective. 
    January 1, 2016 
    Deferred financing costs related to lines-of-credit of approximately $3.1 million recorded within Other deferred assets were not reclassified. 
      2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) 
    The standard simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the standard. Transition method: retrospective. 
    January 1, 2016 
    Deferred financing costs of approximately $2.1 million previously classified within Other prepayments and current assets and $14.0 million previously classified within Other deferred assets were reclassified to reduce the related debt liabilities.

    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
      2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments 
    This standard clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. When a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity no longer has to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. Transition method: a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the effective date. 
    January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard, but do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

      2014-09, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
    The Revenue from Contracts with Customers standard provides a single and comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing revenue recognition. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments to the standard provide further clarification on contract revenue recognition specifically related to the implementation of the principal versus agent evaluation, the identification of performance obligations, clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property, and allows for the election to account for shipping and handling activities performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. Transition method: a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach.

Note   3       Regulatory Matters 
    
  Ohio law requires that all Ohio distribution utilities file either an ESP or MRO to establish rates for SSO service.  Although it has been in effect since January 2014, on June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio (Court) issued an opinion in the appeal of   DP L s   ESP 2, which had been approved by the PUCO for the years 2014-2016 and which, among other matters, permitted   DP L   to collect a non-bypassable service stability rider equal to approximately   $9.2 million   per month for each of those years and required   DP L   to legally separate its generation assets by January 1, 2017.  Over the period of ESP 2,   DP L   has used all available cash flow to fund, among other things, debt repayments and necessary investments to ensure reliability and system performance.  No dividends have been paid by   DPL   to AES during this period.  In the opinion, the Court stated briefly, without expanding upon the basis, that the PUCO s approval of the ESP was reversed on the authority of one of the Court s prior rulings in a separate case not involving   DP L  .  In view of that reversal, on July 27, 2016   DP L   filed a motion to withdraw ESP 2 and implement rates consistent with those in effect as a result of ESP 1. 
    
  On August 26, 2016, the PUCO granted   DP L's   motion to withdraw ESP 2, thereby terminating ESP 2 and its provisions, terms and conditions, including the requirement for   DP L   to legally separate its generation assets by January 1, 2017.  While   DP L   may legally separate its generation assets, it is continuing to evaluate its options and timing with respect to separation.  Further, the PUCO granted   DP L's   motion to implement the provisions, terms and conditions of ESP 1 until a subsequent standard service offer is authorized by the PUCO.  Tariffs consistent with the PUCO's Finding and Order were filed and became effective September 1, 2016.  The rates under ESP 1 will be in place until rates consistent with the outcome for   DP L s   pending ESP 3 filing are approved and effective.  The impact of reverting to ESP 1 is expected to result in a revenue reduction of approximately   $3.0 million   per month compared to those collected under ESP 2. 
    
  On February 22, 2016,   DP L   filed ESP 3 at the PUCO seeking an effective date of January 1, 2017.  On September 23, 2016,   DP L   withdrew part of its ESP 3 filing that requested a Reliable Electricity Rider (RER).  On October 11, 2016,   DP L   filed an amended application requesting to recover   $145.0 million   per year for seven years that supports the alternative to the RER, named the Distribution Modernization Rider.  Also as part of its plan,   DP L   recommends including renewable energy attributes as part of the product that is competitively bid, and seeks recovery of approximately   $10.5 million   of regulatory assets.  The plan also proposes a new Distribution Investment Rider to allow   DP L   to recover costs associated with future distribution equipment and infrastructure needs.  Additionally, the plan establishes new riders set initially at zero, related to energy reductions from   DP L s   energy efficiency programs, and certain environmental costs   DP L   may incur.  An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin December 5, 2016.  There can be no assurance that ESP 3 will be approved as filed or on a timely basis.  If ESP 3 is not approved on a timely basis or if the final ESP 3 provides for terms that are more adverse than those submitted in   DP L's   application, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially impacted.

Note   4       Fair Value 
    
  The fair values of our financial instruments are based on published sources for pricing when possible.  We rely on valuation models only when no other methods exist.  The value of our financial instruments represents our best estimates of the fair value, which may not be the value realized in the future. 
    
  The following table presents the fair value, carrying value and cost of our non-derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Information about the fair value of our derivative instruments can be found in   Note 5   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 

These financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or collateral requirements and as such are presented in the Condensed   Consolidated   Balance Sheet at their gross fair value, except for Debt, which is presented at amortized carrying value.    
    
  Debt 
  Unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the financial statements as debt is presented at cost, net of unamortized premium or discount and deferred financing costs in the financial statements.  The debt amounts include the current portion payable in the next twelve months and have maturities that range from   2016   to   2061  . 
    
  Master Trust Assets 
  DP L   established Master Trusts to hold assets that could be used for the benefit of employees participating in employee benefit plans and these assets are not used for general operating purposes.  These assets are primarily comprised of open-ended mutual funds, which are valued using the net asset value per unit.  These investments are recorded at fair value within Other deferred assets on the balance sheets and classified as available-for-sale.  Any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. 
    
  DPL   had   $0.9 million   (  $0.6 million   after tax) of unrealized gains and immaterial unrealized losses on the Master Trust assets in AOCI at   September 30, 2016   and   $0.7 million   (  $0.5 million   after tax) of unrealized gains and   $0.1 million   (  $0.1 million   after tax) in unrealized losses on the Master Trust assets in AOCI at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $2.3 million   (  $1.5 million   after tax) of various investments were sold to facilitate the distribution of benefits and the unrealized gains were reversed into earnings.  An immaterial amount of unrealized gains are expected to be reversed to earnings as investments are sold over the next twelve months to facilitate the distribution of benefits. 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  These inputs are then categorized as: 
             
    Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); 

20 

     Table of Contents  

Level 2 (observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active); or 
                
    Level 3 (unobservable inputs). 
     Valuations of assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk.  We include our own credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk in our calculation of fair value using global average default rates based on an annual study conducted by a large rating agency. 
    
  We did not have any transfers of the fair values of our financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The fair value of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the respective category within the fair value hierarchy for   DPL   was determined as follows: 

21 

     Table of Contents  

Our financial instruments are valued using the market approach in the following categories: 
             
    Level 1 inputs are used for derivative contracts such as heating oil futures, natural gas futures and for money market accounts that are considered cash equivalents.  The fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. 
                
    Level 2 inputs are used to value derivatives such as forward power contracts (which are traded on the OTC market but which are valued using prices on the NYMEX for similar contracts on the OTC market).  Other Level 2 assets include open-ended mutual funds that are in the Master Trust, which are valued using observable prices based on the end of day net asset value per unit. 
                
    Level 3 inputs such as FTRs are considered a Level 3 input because the monthly auctions are considered inactive.  Other Level 3 inputs include the credit valuation adjustment on some of the forward power contracts and forward power contracts in less active markets.  Our Level 3 inputs are immaterial to our derivative balances as a whole and as such no further disclosures are presented. 
     Approximately   93%   of the inputs to the fair value of our derivative instruments are from quoted market prices.    
    
  Our debt is fair valued for disclosure purposes only and most of the fair values are determined using quoted market prices in inactive markets.  These fair value inputs are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  As the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base loan is not publicly traded, fair value is assumed to equal carrying value.  These fair value inputs are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there are no observable inputs.  Additional Level 3 disclosures are not presented since debt is not recorded at fair value. 
    
  Cash Equivalents 
  DPL   had   $90.1 million   in money market funds included as part of cash and cash equivalents in its   Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  The money market funds have quoted prices that are generally equivalent to par. 

22 

     Table of Contents  

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  We use the cost approach to determine the fair value of our AROs, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value at the initial recording of the liability.  Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal cost as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates.  These inputs to the fair value of the AROs would be considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.  AROs for ash ponds, asbestos, river structures and underground storage tanks   increased   by a net amount of   $3.0 million   and   increased   by a net amount of   $38.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  When evaluating impairment of long-lived assets, we measure fair value using the applicable fair value measurement guidance.  Impairment expense is measured by comparing the fair value at the evaluation date to the carrying amount. The following table summarizes Long-lived assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and their level within the fair value hierarchy (there were   no   impairments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ):

Note   5       Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  In the normal course of business,   DPL   enters into various financial arrangements, including derivative financial instruments.  We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for commodities.  The derivatives that we use to economically hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward and futures contracts.  Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required.  The objective of the hedging program is to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that we have adequate resources to meet our requirements.  We monitor and value derivative positions monthly as part of our risk management processes.  We use published sources for pricing, when possible, to mark positions to market.  All of our derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale, cash flow hedges or marked to market each reporting period.

(a)    Refers to whether the derivative instruments have been designated as a cash flow hedge. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  As part of our risk management processes, we identify the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The fair value of cash flow hedges is determined by observable market prices available as of the balance sheet dates and will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to contract expiration.  The effective portion of the hedging transaction is recognized in AOCI and transferred to earnings using specific identification of each contract when the forecasted hedged transaction takes place or when the forecasted hedged transaction is probable of not occurring.  The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings in the current period.  All risk components were taken into account to determine the hedge effectiveness of the cash flow hedges. 
    
  We enter into forward power contracts to manage commodity price risk exposure related to our generation of electricity.  We do not hedge all commodity price risk.  We reclassify gains and losses on forward power contracts from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which the contracts settle.

The following table provides information for   DPL   concerning gains or losses recognized in AOCI for the cash flow hedges for the   three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a)  The actual amounts that we reclassify from AOCI to earnings related to power can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes. 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedges 
  Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sales exceptions under FASC 815.  Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the Condensed   Consolidated   Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurred.  This is commonly referred to as  MTM accounting.   Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty.  FTRs, heating oil futures, natural gas, and certain forward power contracts are currently marked to market. 
    
  Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts, as provided under GAAP.  Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under GAAP are not subject to MTM accounting and are recognized in the Condensed   Consolidated   Statements of Operations on an accrual basis. 
    
  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
  In accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP, a cost or loss that is probable of recovery in future rates should be deferred as a regulatory asset and revenue or a gain that is probable of being returned to customers should be deferred as a regulatory liability.  Therefore, a portion of the heating oil futures are assigned to the retail

jurisdiction and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts settle.  If these unrealized gains and losses are no longer deemed to be probable of recovery through our rates, they will be reclassified into earnings in the period such determination is made.  Beginning January 1, 2016, we no longer assign any portion of the heating oil futures to our retail jurisdiction as all of our SSO retail sales are sourced through the competitive bid process. 
    
  Financial Statement Effect 
  The following tables present the amount and classification within the Condensed   Consolidated   Statements of Operations or Condensed   Consolidated   Balance Sheets of the gains and losses on   DPL s   derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Credit risk-related contingent features 
  Certain of our OTC commodity derivative contracts are under master netting agreements that contain provisions that require us to post collateral if our credit ratings drop below certain thresholds.  We have crossed that threshold with one counterparty to the derivative instruments and they could request that we post collateral of   $0.9 million   at this time. 
    
  The aggregate fair value of   DPL s   commodity derivative instruments that were in a MTM loss position at   September 30, 2016   was   $30.9 million  .    $5.1 million   of collateral was posted directly with third parties and in a broker margin account which offsets our loss positions on the forward contracts.  This liability position is further offset by the asset position of counterparties with master netting agreements of   $22.7 million  .  Since our debt is below investment grade, we could have to post collateral for the remaining   $3.1 million  .

    Note payable to related party. See   Note 11   Related Party Transactions   for additional information. 
       
  Premiums or discounts recognized at the date of the Merger are amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. 
    
  Significant transactions 
  On February 5, 2016,   $73.0 million   of   DPL's     $130.0 million     6.5%   Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2016 were redeemed under the indenture's make-whole call provision, which allows for the bonds to be called prior to maturity with a make-whole payment as determined by discounting the bond's future cash flow by a similarly maturing U.S. Treasury bond's yield plus 50 basis points.  On the call date, principal plus the make-whole payment due totaled   $75.4 million  , which was paid with cash on hand.  On October 17, 2016, the remaining   $57.0 million   of the   6.5%   Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2016 were redeemed at maturity with cash on hand. 
    
  On August 24, 2016,   DP L   refinanced its   $445.0 million   of   1.875%   First Mortgage Bonds due 2016, with a variable rate Term Loan B of   $445.0 million   maturing on August 24, 2022 and secured by a pledge of   DP L   First Mortgage Bonds.  The variable interest rate on the loan is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread of   3.25%  , with a LIBOR floor of   0.75%  .  Up to the maturity date but not starting until March 31, 2017, the loan amortizes   0.25%   of the initial principal balance quarterly, and contains covenants and restrictions that are generally consistent with existing   DP L   credit agreements. 
    
  Debt covenants and restrictions 
  DP L s   unsecured revolving credit agreement and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement have   two   financial covenants.  The first financial covenant measures Total Debt to Total Capitalization. The Total Debt to Total Capitalization ratio is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing total debt at the end of the quarter by total capitalization at the end of the quarter.  The second financial covenant ratio compares EBITDA to Interest Expense.  The EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing EBITDA for the   four   prior fiscal quarters by the consolidated interest charges for the same period.

The cost of borrowing under   DP L's   unsecured revolving credit agreement and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement adjust under certain credit rating scenarios. 
    
  DPL s   revolving credit agreement and term loan have   two   financial covenants.  The first financial covenant, a Total Debt to EBITDA ratio, is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter by dividing total debt at the end of the current quarter by consolidated EBITDA for the   four   prior fiscal quarters.  The second financial covenant, an EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio, is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing EBITDA for the   four   prior fiscal quarters by the consolidated interest charges for the same period. 
    
  The cost of borrowing under   DPL's   revolving credit agreement and term loan adjust under certain credit rating scenarios.    DPL s   revolving credit agreement, term loan, and senior unsecured notes due 2019 restrict dividend payments from   DPL   to AES.

Note   7       Income Taxes 
    
  The following table details the effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Income tax expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax rates for   2016   and   2015   of   38.6%   and   30.8%  , respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , management estimated the annual effective tax rate based on its forecast of annual pre-tax income.  To the extent that actual pre-tax results for the year differ from the forecasts applied to the most recent interim period, the rates estimated could be materially different from the actual effective tax rates. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   DPL s   current period effective tax rate was greater than the estimated annual effective rate primarily due to a change in its uncertain tax positions.  The increase in the annual effective rate compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a forecasted pre-tax loss in the 2016 tax year. 

Note   8       Benefit Plans 
    
  DP L   sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for the vast majority of its employees. 
    
  We generally fund pension plan benefits as accrued in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and, in addition, make voluntary contributions from time to time.  There were   $5.0 million   in employer contributions made during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $5.0 million   in employer contributions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The amounts presented in the following tables for pension include the collective bargaining plan formula, the traditional management plan formula, the cash balance plan formula and the SERP, in the aggregate.  The amounts presented for postretirement include both health and life insurance.  The pension and postretirement costs below have not been adjusted for amounts billed to the Service Company for former   DP L   employees who are now employed by the Service Company but are still participants in the   DP L   plan.

Note   9   -   Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 
    
  On October 13, 2016 (the "Redemption Date"),   DPL's   subsidiary,   DP L,   redeemed all of its issued and outstanding preferred stock, consisting of the following series: Preferred Stock,   3.75%   Series A, Cumulative (the  Series A Stock  Preferred Stock,   3.75%   Series B, Cumulative (the  Series B Stock  and Preferred Stock,   3.90%   Series C, Cumulative (the  Series C Stock  and, together with the Series A Stock and the Series B Stock, the  Preferred Stock ).  On the Redemption Date, the Preferred Stock of each series was redeemed at the following prices as specified in   DP L s   Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,     plus, in each case an amount equal to all accrued dividends payable with respect to such Preferred Stock to the Redemption Date: a price of   $102.50   per share for the Series A Stock, a price of   $103.00   per share for the Series B Stock, and a price of   $101.00   per share for the Series C Stock.  Dividends on the Preferred Stock ceased to accrue on the Redemption Date. Upon redemption, the Preferred Stock is no longer outstanding, and     all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of   DP L  , except the right to payment of the redemption price, ceased to exist. 
    
  As we issued the notice to redeem the preferred stock of   DP L   in the third quarter, the   $23.5 million   redemption value was included in Other Current Liabilities as of September 30, 2016.  The difference between the carrying value of the Redeemable Preferred Stock of Subsidiary and the redemption amount was charged to   Other paid-in capital  .

     Table of Contents  

In addition, with   DP L   preferred stock no longer outstanding, certain provisions in   DP L's   Amended Articles of Incorporation which could limit the payment of cash dividends on any of its common stock, no longer apply.  

Note   10       Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Guarantees 
  In the normal course of business,   DPL   enters into various agreements with its wholly-owned subsidiary,   AES Ohio Generation  , providing financial or performance assurance to third parties.  These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to these subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish these subsidiaries  intended commercial purposes. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   DPL   had   $16.6 million   of guarantees on behalf of   AES Ohio Generation   to third parties for future financial or performance assurance under such agreements.  The guarantee arrangements entered into by   DPL   with these third parties cover select present and future obligations of   AES Ohio Generation   to such beneficiaries and are terminable by   DPL   upon written notice to the beneficiaries within a certain time. The carrying amount of obligations for commercial transactions covered by these guarantees recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was   $4.8 million   and   $0.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  To date,   DPL   has not incurred any losses related to the guarantees of   AES Ohio Generation   s obligations and we believe it is remote that   DPL   would be required to perform or incur any losses in the future associated with any of the above guarantees. 
    
  Equity Ownership Interest 
  DP L   owns a   4.9%   equity ownership interest in OVEC, which is recorded using the cost method of accounting under GAAP.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L   could be responsible for the repayment of   4.9%  , or   $74.9 million  , of a   $1,528.0 million   debt obligation that has maturities from   2018   to   2040  .  This would only happen if OVEC defaulted on its debt payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have no knowledge of such a default. 
    
  Commercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
  There have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to our commercial commitments and to the information disclosed in the contractual obligations table in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under various laws and regulations.  We believe the amounts provided in our Condensed   Consolidated   Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies.  However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations and other matters discussed below, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Condensed   Consolidated   Financial Statements.  As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of   September 30, 2016  , cannot be reasonably determined. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
  DPL s   and   DP L s   facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local environmental regulations and laws.  The environmental issues that may affect us include: 

The federal CAA and state laws and regulations (including State Implementation Plans) which require compliance, obtaining permits and reporting as to air emissions; 
                
    Litigation with federal and certain state governments and certain special interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coal-fired generating stations require additional permitting or pollution control technology, or whether emissions from coal-fired generating stations cause or contribute to climate change; 
                
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA and the Ohio EPA that require or will require substantial reductions in SO   2   , particulates, mercury, acid gases, NOx, and other air emissions.    DP L   has installed

emission control technology and is taking other measures to comply with required and anticipated reductions; 
             
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require reporting and reductions of GHGs; 
                
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA associated with the federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits; and 
                
    Solid and hazardous waste laws and regulations, which govern the management and disposal of certain waste.  The majority of solid waste created from the combustion of coal and fossil fuels consists of fly ash and other coal combustion by-products. 

Note   11       Related Party Transactions    
    
  Service Company 
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Service Company began providing services including operations, accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other corporate services on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies,   DPL   and   DP L  .  The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations.  This includes ensuring that the regulated utilities served, including   DP L  , are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses. 
    
  Benefit plans 
  DPL   has an agreement with AES or one of its affiliates to participate in a group benefits program, including but not limited to, health, dental, vision and life benefits.  AES or its affiliate administers the financial aspects of the group insurance program, receives all premium payments from the participating affiliates, and makes all vendor payments. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of these transactions: 

DPL Capital Trust II 
  DPL   has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II (the "Trust"), formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to third-party investors.  Effective in 2003,   DPL   deconsolidated the Trust upon adoption of the accounting standards related to variable interest entities and currently treats the Trust as a nonconsolidated subsidiary.  The Trust holds mandatorily redeemable trust capital securities.  The investment in the Trust, which amounts to   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is included in Other deferred assets within Other non-current assets.    DPL   also has a note payable to the Trust amounting to   $15.6 million   and   $15.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that was established upon the Trust s deconsolidation in 2003.  See   Note 6   Debt   for additional information. 
    
  In addition to the obligations under the note payable mentioned above,   DPL   also agreed to a security obligation which represents a full and unconditional guarantee of payments to the capital security holders of the Trust.

Income taxes 
  AES files federal and state income tax returns which consolidate   DPL   and its subsidiaries.  Under a tax sharing agreement with AES,   DPL   is responsible for the income taxes associated with its own taxable income and records the provision for income taxes using a separate return method.    DPL   had   net payable balances of $97.0 million and $50.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are recorded in Accounts receivable, net and Accrued taxes on the accompanying Balance Sheets on a gross basis.    

Note   12       Business Segments 
    
  At December 31, 2015,   DPL   had   two   segments consisting of the operations of two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries,   DP L   (Utility segment)     and   DPLER   (Competitive Retail segment which included DPLER's wholly-owned subsidiary, MC Squared).  This is how we viewed our business and made decisions on how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. 
    
  The Competitive Retail segment, DPLER s competitive retail electric service business, was sold on January 1, 2016 (see   Note 13   Discontinued Operations  ).    DPL   now operates through one segment, the Utility segment.  Segment disclosures for 2015 have not been restated to show the competitive retail segment as a discontinued operation and therefore do not tie to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  The Utility segment is comprised of   DP L s   electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses which generate and deliver electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers.    DP L   generates electricity at   five   coal-fired power plants and   DP L   distributes power to approximately   518,000   retail customers who are located in a   6,000   square mile area of West Central Ohio.  Prior to the sale of DPLER,   DP L   also sold electricity to DPLER and to other Ohio utilities.  In 2016, all of   DP L's   electricity for SSO customers was sourced through a competitive bid auction and   DP L's   energy and capacity was primarily sold into the PJM wholesale market.    DP L s   transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators while rates for its generation business are deemed competitive under Ohio law. 
    
  The Competitive Retail segment s electric energy used to meet its sales obligations was purchased from   DP L  .  Intercompany sales from   DP L   to DPLER were based on fixed-price contracts for each customer; the price approximated market prices for wholesale power at the inception of each customer s contract.  These agreements were terminated in connection with the sale of DPLER on January 1, 2016.  
    
  Included in the  Other  column in the following tables are other businesses that do not meet the GAAP requirements for disclosure as reportable segments, certain corporate costs including interest expense on   DPL s   debt, and adjustments related to purchase accounting from the Merger.  Management evaluates segment performance based on gross margin.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in   Note 1   Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  .  Intersegment sales and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

Note   13       Discontinued Operations 
    
  On January 1, 2016,   DPL   closed on the sale of DPLER, its competitive retail business.  The sale agreement was signed on December 28, 2015 and   DPL   received   $75.5 million   of restricted cash on December 31, 2015 for the sale.  This amount was shown as Restricted cash with the associated liability shown as "  Deposit received on sale of DPLER  " on the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  Assets and liabilities related to DPLER were reclassified

     Table of Contents  

to "Assets held for sale" and "Liabilities held for sale" in the December 31, 2015 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.    DPL   recorded a gain on this transaction of   $49.2 million   in the first quarter of 2016.  The gain includes the impact of DPLER s liability to   DP L   that transferred with the sale on January 1, 2016 but was eliminated in consolidation at December 31, 2015.  Deferred taxes and intercompany balances were not reclassified to held for sale. 
    
  Operating activities related to DPLER have been reclassified to "Discontinued operations" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the major categories of assets, liabilities at the dates indicated, and the revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income tax of discontinued operations as of and for the periods indicated: 

DPLER purchased its power from   DP L   during 2015.  Prior to DPLER being presented as a discontinued operation, this purchased power and   DP L's   corresponding wholesale revenue would have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Cash flows related to discontinued operations are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Cash flows from operating activities for discontinued operations were   $(0.7) million   and   $28.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash flows from investing activities for discontinued operations were   $75.5 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  All cash generated from discontinued operations was paid to   DPL   through dividends for all periods presented. 

Note   14       Fixed-asset Impairment 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we tested the recoverability of our long-lived assets at certain of our generation facilities at   DP L  .  A ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio on June 20, 2016, lower expectation of future capacity revenue resulting from the most recent PJM capacity auction and a higher anticipated level of environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be an impairment indicator for these assets.    We performed a long-lived asset impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of Killen and certain   DP L   peaking generating facilities were not recoverable.    The asset groups of Killen and these

     Table of Contents  

DP L   peaking generating facilities were determined to have fair values of   $84.3 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively, using the discounted cash flows under the income approach.  As a result, we recognized an asset impairment expense of   $230.8 million   and   $4.7 million   for Killen and these   DP L   peaking generating facilities, respectively.

Note   1       Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Description of Business 
  DP L   is a public utility incorporated in 1911 under the laws of Ohio.  Beginning in 2001, Ohio law gave Ohio consumers the right to choose the electric generation supplier from whom they purchase retail generation service; however, distribution and transmission retail services are still regulated.    DP L   has the exclusive right to provide such distribution and transmission services to approximately   518,000   customers located in West Central Ohio.  Additionally,   DP L   offers retail SSO electric service to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in a     6,000     square mile area of West Central Ohio.    DP L   owns multiple coal-fired and peaking electric generating facilities as well as numerous transmission facilities, all of which are included in the financial statements at amortized cost.    DP L   sources   100%   of the generation for its SSO customers through a competitive bid process.  Principal industries located in   DP L s   service territory include automotive, food processing, paper, plastic, manufacturing and defense.    DP L's   distribution sales reflect the general economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns, retail competition in our service territory and the market price of electricity.    DP L   sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market.      DP L   is a subsidiary of   DPL  . 
    
  DP L s   electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators while its generation business is deemed competitive under Ohio law.  Accordingly,   DP L   applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates, and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs. 
    
  DP L   employed   1,163   people as of   September 30, 2016  .  Approximately   62%   of all employees are under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on   October 31, 2017  . 
    
  Financial Statement Presentation 
  DP L   does not have any subsidiaries.    DP L   has undivided ownership interests in five coal-fired generating facilities, peaking electric generating facilities and numerous transmission facilities, all of which are included in the financial statements at amortized cost.  Operating revenues and expenses of these facilities are included on a pro rata basis in the corresponding lines in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  Certain immaterial amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements, the instructions of Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted from this interim report.  Therefore, our interim financial statements in this report should be read along with the annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the opinion of our management, the Condensed   Financial Statements presented in this report contain all adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  ; our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Unless otherwise noted, all adjustments are normal and recurring in nature.  Due to various factors, including, but not limited to, seasonal weather variations, the timing of outages of EGUs, changes in economic conditions involving commodity prices and competition, and other factors, interim results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of our results that will be realized for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the revenues and expenses of the periods reported.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Significant items subject to such estimates and judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; liabilities recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.

Accounting for Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities 
  DP L   collects certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments from its customers.  These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and not included in revenue.    The amounts of such taxes collected for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $14.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively.  The amounts of such taxes collected for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $38.9 million and $38.5 million, respectively.

    Date of Adoption 
    Effect on the financial statements upon adoption 
      New Accounting Standards Adopted 
      2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 
    Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03, this standard clarifies that the SEC Staff would not object to an entity presenting debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset that is subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. Transition method: retrospective. 
    January 1, 2016 
    Deferred financing costs related to lines-of-credit of approximately $0.7 million recorded within Other deferred assets were not reclassified. 
      2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) 
    The standard simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the standard. Transition method: retrospective. 
    January 1, 2016 
    Deferred financing costs of approximately $1.8 million previously classified within Other prepayments and current assets and $4.5 million previously classified within Other deferred assets were reclassified to reduce the related debt liabilities. 
      2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
    The standard makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance. The standard amends the evaluation of whether (1) fees paid to a decision-maker or service providers represent a variable interest, (2) a limited partnership or similar entity has the characteristics of a VIE and (3) a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Transition method: retrospective. 
    January 1, 2016 
    There were no changes to the consolidation conclusions. 
      New Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
      2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control 
    This standard amends the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by amending how a reporting entity, that is a single decision maker of a VIE, treats indirect interests in that entity held through related parties that are under common control. Transition method: retrospectively. 
    January 1, 2017 Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.  
      2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory 
    This standard requires that an entity recognizes the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Transition method: modified retrospective method. 
    January 1, 2018 Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.  
      2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) 
    This standard provides specific guidance on how certain cash transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Transition method: retrospective method 
    January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements but do not anticipate a material impact.

      2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    This standard updates the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost to an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model. It also allows for the presentation of credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as an allowance rather than a write down. Transition method: various. 
    January 1, 2020 Early adoption is permitted only as of January 1, 2019. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.  
      2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
    The standard simplifies the following aspects of accounting for share-based payment awards: accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of employee taxes paid on statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. Transition method: Various.

    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.  
      2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments 
    This standard clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. When a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity no longer has to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. Transition method: a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the effective date. 
    January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard, but do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements.  
      2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships 
    The standard clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria (including those in paragraphs 815-20-35-14 through 35-18) continue to be met. Transition method: prospective or a modified retrospective basis. 
    January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard, but do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements.  
      2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) 
    The standard creates Topic 842, Leases which supersedes Topic 840, Leases, and introduces a lessee model that brings substantially all leases onto the balance sheet while retaining most of the principles of the existing lessor model in U.S. GAAP and aligning many of those principles with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Transition method: modified retrospective approach with certain practical expedients. 
    January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.  
      2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    The standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. Also, it amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Transition: cumulative effect in Retained Earnings as of adoption or prospectively for equity investments without readily determinable fair value. 
    January 1, 2018. Limited early adoption permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard, but do not anticipate a material impact on our financial statements.  
      2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 
    The standard replaces the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test. Transition method: prospectively. 
    January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. 
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial statements.

    The Revenue from Contracts with Customers standard provides a single and comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing revenue recognition. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments to the standard provide further clarification on contract revenue recognition specifically related to the implementation of the principal versus agent evaluation, the identification of performance obligations, clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property, and allows for the election to account for shipping and handling activities performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. Transition method: a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach.

Note   3       Regulatory Matters 
    
  Ohio law requires that all Ohio distribution utilities file either an ESP or MRO to establish rates for SSO service.  Although it has been in effect since January 2014, on June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio (Court) issued an opinion in the appeal of   DP L s   ESP 2, which had been approved by the PUCO for the years 2014-2016 and which, among other matters, permitted   DP L   to collect a non-bypassable service stability rider equal to approximately   $9.2 million   per month for each of those years and required   DP L   to legally separate its generation assets by January 1, 2017.  Over the period of ESP 2,   DP L   has used all available cash flow to fund, among other things, debt repayments and necessary investments to ensure reliability and system performance.  No dividends have been paid by   DPL   to AES during this period.  In the opinion, the Court stated briefly, without expanding upon the basis, that the PUCO s approval of the ESP was reversed on the authority of one of the Court s prior rulings in a separate case not involving   DP L  .  In view of that reversal, on July 27, 2016   DP L   filed a motion to withdraw ESP 2 and implement rates consistent with those in effect as a result of ESP 1. 

48 

     Table of Contents  

On August 26, 2016, the PUCO granted   DP L's   motion to withdraw ESP 2, thereby terminating ESP 2 and its provisions, terms and conditions, including the requirement for   DP L   to legally separate its generation assets by January 1, 2017.  While   DP L   may legally separate its generation assets, it is continuing to evaluate its options and timing with respect to separation.  Further, the PUCO granted   DP L's   motion to implement the provisions, terms and conditions of ESP 1 until a subsequent standard service offer is authorized by the PUCO.  Tariffs consistent with the PUCO's Finding and Order were filed and became effective September 1, 2016.  The rates under ESP 1 will be in place until rates consistent with the outcome for   DP L s   pending ESP 3 filing are approved and effective.  The impact of reverting to ESP 1 is expected to result in a revenue reduction of approximately   $3.0 million   per month compared to those collected under ESP 2. 
    
  On February 22, 2016,   DP L   filed ESP 3 at the PUCO seeking an effective date of January 1, 2017.  On September 23, 2016,   DP L   withdrew part of its ESP 3 filing that requested a Reliable Electricity Rider (RER).  On October 11, 2016,   DP L   filed an amended application requesting to recover   $145.0 million   per year for seven years that supports the alternative to the RER, named the Distribution Modernization Rider.  Also as part of its plan,   DP L   recommends including renewable energy attributes as part of the product that is competitively bid, and seeks recovery of approximately   $10.5 million   of regulatory assets.  The plan also proposes a new Distribution Investment Rider to allow   DP L   to recover costs associated with future distribution equipment and infrastructure needs.  Additionally, the plan establishes new riders set initially at zero, related to energy reductions from   DP L s   energy efficiency programs, and certain environmental costs   DP L   may incur.  An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin December 5, 2016.  There can be no assurance that ESP 3 will be approved as filed or on a timely basis.  If ESP 3 is not approved on a timely basis or if the final ESP 3 provides for terms that are more adverse than those submitted in   DP L's   application, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially impacted. 

Note   4       Fair Value 
    
  The fair values of our financial instruments are based on published sources for pricing when possible.  We rely on valuation models only when no other methods exist.  The value of our financial instruments represents our best estimates of the fair value, which may not be the value realized in the future. 
    
  The following table presents the fair value, carrying value and cost of our non-derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Information about the fair value of our derivative instruments can be found in   Note 5   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 

These financial instruments are not subject to master netting agreements or collateral requirements and as such are presented in the Condensed   Balance Sheet at their gross fair value, except for Debt, which is presented at amortized carrying value. 
    
  Debt 
  Unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the financial statements as debt is presented at cost, net of unamortized premium or discount and deferred financing costs in the financial statements.  The debt amounts include the current portion payable in the next twelve months and have maturities that range from   2016   to   2061  . 

49 

     Table of Contents  

Master Trust Assets    
  DP L   established Master Trusts to hold assets that could be used for the benefit of employees participating in employee benefit plans and these assets are not used for general operating purposes.  These assets are primarily comprised of open-ended mutual funds, which are valued using the net asset value per unit.  These investments are recorded at fair value within Other deferred assets on the balance sheets and classified as available-for-sale.  Any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. 
    
  DP L   had   $1.1 million   (  $0.7 million   after tax) of unrealized gains and immaterial unrealized losses on the Master Trust assets in AOCI at   September 30, 2016   and   $0.8 million   (  $0.5 million   after tax) in unrealized gains and   $0.1 million   (  $0.1 million   after tax) in unrealized losses on the Master Trust assets in AOCI at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $2.3 million   (  $1.5 million   after tax) of various investments were sold to facilitate the distribution of benefits and the unrealized gains were reversed into earnings.  An immaterial amount of unrealized gains are expected to be reversed to earnings as investments are sold over the next twelve months to facilitate the distribution of benefits. 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  These inputs are then categorized as: 

Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); 
                
    Level 2 (observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active); or 
                
    Level 3 (unobservable inputs). 
     Valuations of assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk.  We include our own credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk in our calculation of fair value using global average default rates based on an annual study conducted by a large rating agency. 
    
  We did not have any transfers of the fair values of our financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The fair value of assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the respective category within the fair value hierarchy for   DP L   was determined as follows: 

51 

     Table of Contents  

Our financial instruments are valued using the market approach in the following categories: 
             
    Level 1 inputs are used for derivative contracts such as heating oil futures, natural gas futures and for money market accounts that are considered cash equivalents.  The fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. 
                
    Level 2 inputs are used to value derivatives such as forward power contracts (which are traded on the OTC market but which are valued using prices on the NYMEX for similar contracts on the OTC market).  Other Level 2 assets include open-ended mutual funds that are in the Master Trust, which are valued using observable prices based on the end of day net asset value per unit. 
                
    Level 3 inputs such as FTRs are considered a Level 3 input because the monthly auctions are considered inactive.  Other Level 3 inputs include the credit valuation adjustment on some of the forward power contracts and forward power contracts in less active markets.  Our Level 3 inputs are immaterial to our derivative balances as a whole and as such no further disclosures are presented. 
     Our debt is fair valued for disclosure purposes only and most of the fair values are determined using quoted market prices in inactive markets.  These fair value inputs are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  As the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base loan is not publicly traded, fair value is assumed to equal carrying value.  These fair value inputs are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as there are no observable inputs.  Additional Level 3 disclosures are not presented since debt is not recorded at fair value. 
    
  Approximately   93%   of the inputs to the fair value of our derivative instruments are from quoted market prices.

Cash Equivalents 
  DP L   had   $90.1 million   in money market funds included as part of cash and cash equivalents in its   Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  The money market funds have quoted prices that are generally equivalent to par. 

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  We use the cost approach to determine the fair value of our AROs, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value at the initial recording of the liability.  Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal cost as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates.  These inputs to the fair value of the AROs would be considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.  AROs for ash ponds, asbestos, river structures and underground storage tanks   increased   by a net amount of   $3.0 million   and   increased   by a net amount of   $38.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  When evaluating impairment of long-lived assets, we measure fair value using the applicable fair value measurement guidance.  Impairment expense is measured by comparing the fair value at the evaluation date to the carrying amount. The following table summarizes Long-lived assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and their level within the fair value hierarchy (there were   no   impairments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ):

Note   5       Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  In the normal course of business,   DP L   enters into various financial arrangements, including derivative financial instruments.  We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for commodities.  The  

53 

     Table of Contents  

derivatives that we use to economically hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward and futures contracts.  Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required.  The objective of the hedging program is to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that we have adequate resources to meet our requirements.  We monitor and value derivative positions monthly as part of our risk management processes.  We use published sources for pricing, when possible, to mark positions to market.  All of our derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale, cash flow hedges or marked to market each reporting period. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L   had the following outstanding derivative instruments: 

(a)    Refers to whether the derivative instruments have been designated as a cash flow hedge. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  ,   DP L   had the following outstanding derivative instruments: 

(a)    Refers to whether the derivative instruments have been designated as a cash flow hedge. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  As part of our risk management processes, we identify the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The fair value of cash flow hedges is determined by observable market prices available as of the balance sheet dates and will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to contract expiration.  The effective portion of the hedging transaction is recognized in AOCI and transferred to earnings using specific identification of each contract when the forecasted hedged transaction takes place or when the forecasted hedged transaction is probable of not occurring.  The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings in the current period.  All risk components were taken into account to determine the hedge effectiveness of the cash flow hedges. 
    
  We enter into forward power contracts to manage commodity price risk exposure related to our generation of electricity.  We do not hedge all commodity price risk.  We reclassify gains and losses on forward power contracts from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which the contracts settle. 

54 

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides information for   DP L   concerning gains or losses recognized in AOCI for the cash flow hedges for the   three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    The actual amounts that we reclassify from AOCI to earnings related to power can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes. 
       
  Derivatives not designated as hedges 
  Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sales exceptions under FASC 815.  Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the Condensed   Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurred.  This is commonly referred to as  MTM accounting.   Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by physical delivery, or net settled with the counterparty.  FTRs, heating oil futures, natural gas, and certain forward power contracts are currently marked to market. 
    
  Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts, as provided under GAAP.  Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under GAAP are not subject to MTM accounting and are recognized in the Condensed   Statements of Operations on an accrual basis. 
    
  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
  In accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP, a cost or loss that is probable of recovery in future rates should be deferred as a regulatory asset and revenue or a gain that is probable of being returned to customers should be deferred as a regulatory liability.  Therefore, a portion of the heating oil futures are assigned to the retail jurisdiction and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts settle.  If these unrealized gains and losses are no longer deemed to be probable of recovery through our rates, they will be reclassified into earnings in  

55 

     Table of Contents  

the period such determination is made.  Beginning January 1, 2016, we no longer assign any portion of the heating oil futures to our retail jurisdiction as all of our SSO retail sales are sourced through the competitive bid process.

Credit risk-related contingent features 
  Certain of our OTC commodity derivative contracts are under master netting agreements that contain provisions that require us to post collateral if our credit ratings drop below certain thresholds.  We have crossed that threshold with one counterparty to the derivative instruments and they could request that we post collateral of   $0.9 million   at this time. 
    
  The aggregate fair value of   DP L s   commodity derivative instruments that were in a MTM loss position at   September 30, 2016   was   $31.0 million  .   $22.8 million   of collateral was posted directly with third parties and in a broker margin account which offsets our loss positions on the forward contracts.  This liability position is further offset by the asset position of counterparties with master netting agreements of   $5.1 million  .  Since our debt is below investment grade, we could have to post collateral for the remaining   $3.1 million  .

  Significant transactions 
  On August 24, 2016,   DP L   refinanced its   1.875%   First Mortgage Bonds Due 2016, with a variable rate Term Loan B of   $445.0 million   maturing on August 24, 2022 and secured by a pledge of   DP L   First Mortgage Bonds.  The variable interest rate on the loan is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread of   3.25%  , with a LIBOR floor of   0.75%  .  Up to the maturity date but not starting until March 31, 2017, the loan amortizes   0.25%   of the initial principal balance quarterly, and contains covenants and restrictions that are generally consistent with existing   DP L   credit agreements. 
    
  Debt covenants and restrictions 
  DP L s   unsecured revolving credit agreement and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement have   two   financial covenants.  The first measures Total Debt to Total Capitalization and is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing total debt at the end of the quarter by total capitalization at the end of the quarter.  The second financial covenant measures EBITDA to Interest Expense.  The EBITDA to Interest Expense ratio is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing EBITDA for the   four   prior fiscal quarters by the consolidated interest charges for the same period. 
    
  The cost of borrowing under   DP L's   unsecured revolving credit agreement and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement adjusts under certain credit rating scenarios.

Note   7       Income Taxes 
    
  The following table details the effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Income tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax rates for   2016   and   2015   of   36.7%   and   29.0%  , respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   management estimated the annual effective tax rate based on its forecast of annual pre-tax income.  To the extent that actual pre-tax results for the year differ from the forecasts  

59 

     Table of Contents  

applied to the most recent interim period, the rates estimated could be materially different from the actual effective tax rates. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L s   current period effective tax rate was greater than the estimated annual effective rate primarily due to a change in its uncertain tax positions and the deduction for the preferred stock dividends.  The increase in the annual effective rate compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a forecasted pre-tax loss in the 2016 tax year. 

Note   8       Benefit Plans 
    
  DP L   sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for the vast majority of its employees. 
    
  We generally fund pension plan benefits as accrued in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and, in addition, make voluntary contributions from time to time.  There were   $5.0 million   in employer contributions made during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $5.0 million   in employer contributions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The amounts presented in the following tables for pension include the collective bargaining plan formula, the traditional management plan formula, the cash balance plan formula and the SERP, in the aggregate.  The amounts presented for postretirement include both health and life insurance.  The pension and postretirement costs below have not been adjusted for amounts billed to the Service Company for former   DP L   employees who are now employed by the Service Company but are still participants in the   DP L   plan.  See   Note 11   Related Party Transactions  . 
    
  The net periodic benefit cost of the pension and postretirement benefit plans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was:

Benefit payments and Medicare Part D reimbursements, which reflect future service, are estimated to be paid as follows: 

Note   9       Shareholder s Equity 
    
  DP L   has   250,000,000   authorized   $0.01   par value common shares, of which   41,172,173   are outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  All common shares are held by   DP L s   parent,   DPL  . 
    
  As part of the PUCO s approval of the Merger,   DP L   agreed to maintain a capital structure that includes an equity ratio, calculated as total equity divided by total capitalization, of at least   50 percent   and not to have a negative retained earnings balance.  After the fixed-asset impairment recorded during the second quarter of 2016 and as of September 30, 2016,   DP L's   equity ratio was   50%   and retained earnings balance was negative.  It is unknown what impact, if any, this will have on   DP L  .    In the generation separation order dated September 17, 2014, the PUCO permitted   DP L   to temporarily maintain long-term debt of   $750.0 million   or   75%   of its rate base, whichever is greater, until January 1, 2018. 
    
  On October 13, 2016 (the "Redemption Date"),   DP L   redeemed all of its issued and outstanding preferred stock, consisting of the following series: Preferred Stock,   3.75%   Series A, Cumulative (the  Series A Stock  Preferred Stock,   3.75%   Series B, Cumulative (the  Series B Stock  and Preferred Stock,   3.90%   Series C, Cumulative (the  Series C Stock  and, together with the Series A Stock and the Series B Stock, the  Preferred Stock ).  On the Redemption Date, the Preferred Stock of each series was redeemed at the following prices as specified in   DP L s   Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation,     plus, in each case an amount equal to all accrued dividends payable with respect to such Preferred Stock to the Redemption Date: a price of   $102.50   per share for the Series A Stock, a price of   $103.00   per share for the Series B Stock, and a price of   $101.00   per share for the Series C Stock.  Dividends on the Preferred Stock ceased to accrue on the Redemption Date. Upon redemption, the Preferred Stock was no longer outstanding, and     all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of   DP L  , except the right to payment of the redemption price, ceased to exist. 
    
  As we issued the notice to redeem the preferred stock in the third quarter, the   $23.5 million   redemption value was included in Other Current Liabilities as of September 30, 2016.  The difference between the carrying value of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and the redemption amount was charged to Other paid-in capital. 
    
  In addition, with   DP L   preferred stock no longer outstanding, certain provisions in   DP L's   Amended Articles of Incorporation which could limit the payment of cash dividends on any of its common stock, no longer apply.  
    
  Equity settlement of related party payable 
  DP L   settled a   $7.5 million   payable to   DPL   relating to income taxes.  This payable balance was settled through equity and   DPL's   investment in   DP L   was increased by   $7.5 million   as consideration for extinguishing the payable. 

Note   10       Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Equity Ownership Interest 
  DP L   owns a   4.9%   equity ownership interest in OVEC, which is recorded using the cost method of accounting under GAAP.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L   could be responsible for the repayment of   4.9%  , or   $74.9 million  , of a   $1,528.0 million   debt obligation that has maturities from   2018   to   2040  .  This would only happen if OVEC defaulted on its debt payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have no knowledge of such a default.

Commercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
  There have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to our commercial commitments and to the information disclosed in the contractual obligations table in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under various laws and regulations.  We believe the amounts provided in our Condensed   Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies.  However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations and other matters discussed below, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Condensed   Financial Statements.  As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of   September 30, 2016  , cannot be reasonably determined. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
  DP L s   facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local environmental regulations and laws.  The environmental issues that may affect us include: 

The federal CAA and state laws and regulations (including State Implementation Plans) which require compliance, obtaining permits and reporting as to air emissions; 
                
    Litigation with federal and certain state governments and certain special interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coal-fired generating stations require additional permitting or pollution control technology, or whether emissions from coal-fired generating stations cause or contribute to climate change; 
                
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA and the Ohio EPA that require or will require substantial reductions in SO   2   , particulates, mercury, acid gases, NOx, and other air emissions.    DP L   has installed emission control technology and is taking other measures to comply with required and anticipated reductions; 
                
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require reporting and reductions of GHGs; 
                
    Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA associated with the federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits; and 
                
    Solid and hazardous waste laws and regulations, which govern the management and disposal of certain waste.  The majority of solid waste created from the combustion of coal and fossil fuels consists of fly ash and other coal combustion by-products. 

Note   11       Related Party Transactions 
    
  Service Company 
  Effective January 1, 2014, the Service Company began providing services including operations, accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other corporate services on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies,   DPL   and   DP L  .  The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations.  This includes ensuring that the regulated utilities served, including   DP L  , are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses. 
    
  Benefit plans 
  DPL   has an agreement with AES or one of its affiliates to participate in a group benefits program, including but not limited to, health, dental, vision and life benefits.  AES or its affiliate administers the financial aspects of the group insurance program, receives all premium payments from the participating affiliates, and makes all vendor payments.

The following table provides a summary of these transactions: 

(a) 
    DP L   sold power to DPLER and MC Squared to satisfy the electric requirements of their retail customers.  The revenue dollars associated with sales to DPLER and MC Squared are recorded as wholesale revenues in   DP L s   Financial Statements.  These agreements were terminated upon the sale of DPLER on January 1, 2016. 
              (b) 
    MVIC, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of   DPL  , provides insurance coverage to   DP L   and other   DPL   subsidiaries for workers  compensation, general liability, property damages and directors  and officers  liability.  These amounts represent insurance premiums paid by   DP L   to MVIC.    DP L   received insurance proceeds from MVIC of   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.4 million   and   $4.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (c) 
    Prior to the sale of DPLER, in the normal course of business   DP L   incurred and recorded expenses on behalf of DPLER. Such expenses included but were not limited to employee-related expenses, accounting, information technology, payroll, legal and other administration expenses.   DP L   subsequently charged these expenses to DPLER at   DP L s   cost and credited the expense in which they were initially recorded. 
        
  Income taxes 
  AES files federal and state income tax returns which consolidate   DPL   and its subsidiaries, including   DP L  .  Under a tax sharing agreement with   DPL  ,   DP L   is responsible for the income taxes associated with its own taxable income and records the provision for income taxes using a separate return method.    DP L   had   a net payable balance of $36.2 million at September 30, 2016 which is recorded in Accounts receivable, net and Accrued taxes on the accompanying Balance Sheets and a net receivable balance of $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 which is recorded in Accounts receivable, net and Accrued taxes on the accompanying Balance Sheets on a gross basis.    
    
  Gain on termination of contract 
  On January 1, 2016,   DPL   closed on the sale of DPLER. Also on January 1, 2016,   DP L   terminated the contract it had with DPLER for the supply of electricity. The agreement terminating the contract was signed on December 28, 2015 and   DP L   received   $27.7 million   of restricted cash on December 31, 2015 for the early termination of the contract. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , this amount was recorded in Gain on termination of contract in the Condensed Statements of Operations and the cash received was included in Cash flows from operating activities in the Condensed Statements of Cash Flows.

Note   12       Fixed-asset Impairment 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we tested the recoverability of our long-lived assets at certain of our generation facilities at   DP L  .  A ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio on June 20, 2016, lower expectation of future capacity revenue resulting from the most recent PJM capacity auction and a higher anticipated level of environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be an impairment indicator for these assets.    We performed a long-lived asset impairment test and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups of Stuart, Killen and Zimmer were not recoverable.  The asset groups of Stuart, Killen and Zimmer were determined to have fair values of   $164.4 million  ,   $84.3 million   and   $111.0 million  , respectively, using the discounted cash flows under the income approach.  As a result, we recognized asset impairment expenses of   $292.0 million  ,   $246.2 million   and   $318.9 million   for Stuart, Killen and Zimmer, respectively during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Item 2   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  This report includes the combined filing of   DPL   and   DP L  .      On November 28, 2011,   DPL   became a wholly-owned subsidiary of AES, a global power company.  Throughout this report, the terms  we,   us,   our  and  ours  are used to refer to both   DPL   and   DP L  , respectively and altogether, unless the context indicates otherwise.  Discussions or areas of this report that apply only to   DPL   or   DP L   will clearly be noted in the section. 
    
  The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes of   DPL   and the Condensed Financial Statements and related footnotes of   DP L   included in   Part I   Financial Information  , the risk factors in Item 1A to Part I of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and in Item 1A to Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our  Forward-Looking Statements  section of this Form 10-Q.  For a list of certain abbreviations or acronyms in this discussion, see the Glossary at the beginning of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  POLITICAL FACTORS 
    
  The outcome of the 2016 U.S. elections could result in significant changes to U.S. environmental policies, energy policies and tax laws, the impact of which is uncertain. 
    
  REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
    
  DPL s  ,   DP L s   and our subsidiaries  facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of regulations and laws by federal, state and local authorities.  As well as imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at these facilities and operations in an effort to comply, or to determine compliance, with such regulations.  We record liabilities for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  See   Note 10   Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies   of Notes to   DPL s   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and   Note 10   Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies   of Notes to   DP L s   Condensed Financial Statements.    In addition to matters discussed or updated herein, our Forms 10-K and 10-Q previously filed with the SEC during 2016 describe other regulatory matters which have not materially changed since those filings. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
    
  In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.  In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at our facilities and operations to comply, or to determine compliance, with such regulations.  We record liabilities for loss contingencies related to environmental matters when a loss is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with the provisions of GAAP.  We did not have any accruals for environmental matters as of   September 30, 2016  .  We have a number of environmental matters for which we have not accrued loss contingencies because the risk of loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, which are disclosed in the paragraphs below.  We evaluate the potential liability related to environmental matters quarterly and may revise our accruals.  Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
    
  We have several pending environmental matters associated with our EGUs and stations.  Some of these matters could have material adverse effects on the operation of such EGUs and stations or our financial condition. 
    
  Clean Water Act rules for Selenium 
  On July 13, 2016, the USEPA published the final updated chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant selenium in freshwater per CWA section 304(a).  The rule will be implemented after state rulemaking occurs, which is expected to be at the end of 2017, and requirements will be incorporated into NPDES permits with compliance schedules in some cases.  We are reviewing the rule and cannot yet say what the impact will be on our operations. 
    
  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 
  On September 7, 2016, the USEPA finalized an update to the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS.  CSAPR addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air  

65 

     Table of Contents  

pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS.  The final rule finds that NOx ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Ohio) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS.  For these 22 states, the USEPA is issuing federal implementation plans that generally update existing CSAPR NOx ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states, and implement these budgets through modifications to the existing CSAPR NOx ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation will start in the 2017 ozone season (May through September 2017).  Affected facilities will receive fewer ozone season NOx allowances in 2017 and later, possibly     resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances.  At this time, we cannot predict what the impact will be with respect to these new standards and requirements, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase additional allowances based on reduced allocations. 
    
  Regulation of Waste Disposal 
  In September 2002,   DP L   and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considers   DP L   to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at the South Dayton Dump landfill site.  On June 8, 2016, the PRP group entered into another Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASAOC) (the  2016 ASAOC ) for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study.  On July 5, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint against   DP L   and other defendants, which the Court granted on August 15, 2016.    DP L   is unable to predict the outcome of these actions by the plaintiffs and the USEPA.  Additionally, the District Court s 2013 ruling and the Court of Appeals  affirmation of that ruling in 2014 do not address future litigation that may arise with respect to actual remediation costs.  While   DP L   is unable to predict the outcome of these and any future matters, if   DP L   were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  On April 7, 2010, the USEPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing that it is reassessing existing regulations governing the use and distribution in commerce of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  This reassessment is in the early stages and the USEPA is seeking information from potentially affected parties on how it should proceed.  A proposed rule is expected in 2017.  At present,   DP L   is unable to predict the impact of this initiative but it could have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
    
  PJM PRICING 
    
  Capacity Auction Price 
  The PJM capacity base residual auction for the   2019/20   period cleared at a per megawatt price of   $100  /MW-day for our RTO area.  The per megawatt prices for the periods   2018/19  ,   2017/18  ,   2016/17   and   2015/16   were   $165  /MW-day,   $152  /MW-day,   $134  /MW-day and   $136  /MW-day, respectively, based on previous auctions.  As discussed in our Form 10-K, a new CP program has been approved by the FERC, which will phase out RPM as of the 2018/19 period.  During the phase-out period, the RPM auction results were modified based on transitional auctions that were conducted in the third quarter of 2015.  We cannot predict the outcome of future auctions but based on actual results attained, we estimate that a hypothetical increase or decrease of $10/MW-day in the capacity auction price would result in an annual impact to net income of approximately   $6.2 million   and   $5.1 million   for   DPL   and   DP L  , respectively.  These estimates do not, however, take into consideration the other factors that may affect the impact of capacity revenues and costs on net income such as our generation capacity and the levels of wholesale revenues.  These estimates are discussed further within Commodity Pricing Risk under the Market Risk section of this Management Discussion   Analysis. 
    
  At present,   DP L   is unable to project whether the CP program will be beneficial or negative to   DP L s   operations, but the results could be material to   DP L s   results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
    
  OHIO COMPETITION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Ohio Retail Rates  
  Since January 2001,   DP L s   electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier.    DP L   continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state certified territory and the obligation to provide retail generation service to customers that do not choose an alternative supplier; however, the supply of electricity for   DP L s   SSO customers is all sourced through competitive bid as of January 2016.  The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over   DP L s   delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services. 

66 

     Table of Contents  

On November 30, 2015,   DP L   filed a distribution rate case using a 12-month test year of June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 to measure revenue and expenses and a date certain of September 30, 2015 to measure its asset base.    DP L   is seeking an increase to distribution revenues of $65.0 million per year.    DP L   has asked for recovery of certain regulatory assets as well as two new riders that would allow   DP L   to recover certain costs on an ongoing basis.  It has proposed a modified straight-fixed variable rate design in an effort to decouple distribution revenues from electric sales.  If approved as filed, the rates are expected to have an effect of approximately 4% on a typical residential customer bill based on rates in effect at the time of the filing. 
    
  For a discussion of the current status of   DP L's   ESPs, please see   Note 3   Regulatory Matters   of Notes to   DPL's   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and   Note 3   Regulatory Matters   of Notes to   DP L's   Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  On August 25, 2016,   DP L   filed an application at the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act requesting authorization to transfer   DP L   generation assets to AES Ohio Generation.  Several parties have intervened and filed comments or protests.  This application is still pending but is not expected to have a material financial impact to   DPL   or   DP L  . 
    
  The following tables provide a summary of the number of electric customers and volumes supplied by DPLER while an affiliate and non-affiliated CRES providers in our service territory during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    Customers at the end of each period. 
              (b) 
    The volumes supplied by DPLER, prior to its sale on January 1, 2016, represented approximately   27%   and   29%   of   DP L s   total distribution volumes during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
       
  DPLER was an affiliated company until its sale on January 1, 2016.  While owned by   DPL  , DPLER was one of the registered CRES providers that marketed competitive transmission and generation services.

FUEL AND RELATED COSTS 
    
  Fuel and Commodity Prices 
  The coal market is a global market in which domestic prices are affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance.  In addition, domestic issues like government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues affect mining costs and supply availability.  Our approach is to hedge the fuel costs for our anticipated electric sales.  For the year ending   December 31, 2016  , we have substantially all our coal requirements under contract to meet our committed sales.  We may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility.  If our suppliers do not meet their contractual commitments or we are not hedged against price volatility, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   DPL 
    
  DPL s   results of operations include the results of its subsidiaries, including the consolidated results of its principal subsidiary   DP L  .  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  A separate specific discussion of the results of operations for   DP L   is presented elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Income Statement Highlights   DPL 

(a) 
    For purposes of discussing operating results, we present and discuss gross margins. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends and includes the same information that is used by management to make decisions regarding our financial performance. 
       
  DPL   Revenues 
  Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity during warmer and colder weather than they do during mild temperatures.  Therefore,     our retail sales volume is impacted by the number of heating and cooling degree days occurring during a year.  Cooling degree days typically have a more significant impact than heating degree days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes. 

(a) 
    Heating and cooling degree days are a measure of the relative heating or cooling required for a home or business.  The heating degrees in a day are calculated as the difference of the average actual daily temperature below 65 degrees  

69 

     Table of Contents  

Fahrenheit.  For example, if the average temperature on March 20th was 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the heating degrees for that day would be the 25 degree difference between 65 degrees and 40 degrees.  In a similar manner, cooling degrees in a day are the difference of the average actual daily temperature in excess of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. 
    
  We sell generation into the wholesale market which covers a multi-state area and settles on an hourly basis throughout the year, factors impacting our wholesale sales volume each hour of the year include: wholesale market prices; retail demand throughout the entire wholesale market area; availability of our plants and non-affiliated utility plants to sell into the wholesale market; and weather conditions across the multi-state region.  Our plan is to make wholesale sales when market prices allow for the economic operation of our generation facilities when margin opportunities exist between the wholesale sales and power purchase prices. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of changes in revenues from the prior period: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Revenues   decreased $14.0 million   to   $389.3 million   from   $403.3 million   in the same period of the prior year.  This decrease was primarily the result of lower average retail and wholesale rates, partially offset by higher retail volume and higher wholesale volume.  The changes in the components of revenue are discussed below: 

Retail revenues   decreased $5.8 million   primarily due to lower average   DP L   retail rates. The decrease in retail rates was primarily driven by decreased retail revenue from SSO customers as the competitive auction rate, which represents 100% of   DP L   SSO load in 2016 compared to 60% in 2015, is lower than the non-auction generation rate.  Warmer summer weather in 2016 contributed to the volume increase as cooling degree days increased by 237.  The aforementioned impacts resulted in   an unfavorable $21.4 million   retail price variance and   a favorable $16.7 million   retail volume variance.   In addition, there was an unfavorable $1.1 million variance in other miscellaneous retail revenues. 

Wholesale revenues   decreased $3.9 million   primarily as a result of   an unfavorable $20.5 million   wholesale price variance and   a favorable $16.6 million   wholesale volume variance.  The price decrease of $20.5 million was primarily due to lower market prices in 2016 and higher prices on sales to DPLER in 2015.  This price decrease was partially offset by a favorable wholesale volume variance due to the fact that   DP L   had excess generation available to be sold in the wholesale market in 2016 resulting from 100% of its SSO load being served through the competitive bid process compared to 60% during 2015.  In addition, there was a 10.2% increase in internal generation from   DP L's   co-owned and operated plants in 2016 compared to the  

70 

     Table of Contents  

prior year.  This favorable wholesale volume variance was partially offset by a decrease in volume due to the sale of DPLER, as   DP L   previously had full requirements sales to DPLER in 2015.  These sales were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to DPLER being a discontinued operation. 

RTO capacity and other revenues, consisting primarily of compensation for use of   DP L s   transmission assets, regulation services, reactive supply and operating reserves, and capacity payments under the RPM construct,   decreased $5.9 million   compared to the prior year.  This decrease was the result of a $1.5 million decrease in RTO transmission and congestion revenue and a $4.4 million decrease in revenue realized from the PJM capacity auction due to lower capacity cleared in the auction.    The capacity prices that became effective in June 2016 were $59/MW-day under the base RPM auction and $134/MW-day for the transitional CP auction, compared to $136/MW-day in June 2015. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Revenues   decreased $170.5 million   to   $1,081.6 million   from   $1,252.1 million   in the same period of the prior year.    This decrease was primarily the result of lower retail rates, lower wholesale rates, and lower wholesale volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes.  The changes in the components of revenue are discussed below: 

Retail revenues   decreased $53.2 million     primarily due to lower average   DP L   retail rates. The decrease in retail rates was primarily driven by decreased retail revenue from SSO customers as the competitive auction rate, which represents 100% of   DP L   SSO load in 2016 compared to 60% in 2015, is lower than the non-auction generation rate.  Warmer weather in 2016 contributed to the volume increase as cooling degree days increased by 127 along with increased sales to commercial and industrial customers.  The aforementioned impacts resulted in   an unfavorable $68.4 million   retail price variance and   a favorable $14.3 million   retail volume variance. In addition, there was   a favorable other miscellaneous variance of $0.9 million  . 

Wholesale revenues   decreased $103.7 million   primarily as a result of   an unfavorable $96.1 million   wholesale price variance and   an unfavorable $7.6 million   wholesale volume variance.  The price decrease of $96.1 million was primarily due to lower market prices in 2016 and higher prices on sales to DPLER in 2015.  Although   DP L   had excess generation available to be sold in the wholesale market in 2016 resulting from 100% of its SSO load being served through the competitive bid process compared to 60% during 2015,   DPL   had a decrease in volume due to the sale of DPLER, as   DP L   previously had full requirements sales to DPLER in 2015.  These sales were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to DPLER being reported as a discontinued operation. 

RTO capacity and other revenues, consisting primarily of compensation for use of   DP L s   transmission assets, regulation services, reactive supply and operating reserves, and capacity payments under the RPM construct,   decreased $15.3 million   compared to the prior year.  This decrease was the result of a $6.6 million decrease in RTO transmission and congestion revenue, as 2015 congestion revenue charges were higher due to the fact that the winter weather was milder in 2016 than 2015.  There was also an $8.7 million decrease in revenue realized from the PJM capacity auction in 2016 due to plant outages in the first quarter and lower capacity cleared in the auction.    The capacity prices that became effective in June 2016 were $59/MW-day under the base RPM auction and $134/MW-day for the transitional CP auction, compared to $136/MW-day in June 2015 and $126/MW-day in June 2014.

  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Cost of revenues   decreased $25.7 million   compared to the same period in the prior year: 

Net fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs,   increased $7.5 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a 15.7% increase in internal generation, partially offset by a 3.7% decrease in average fuel cost per MWh. 

Net purchased power   decreased $33.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year.  This decrease was driven by the following factors: 

Purchased power   increased $4.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable price variance of $10.5 million driven by prices in the competitive bid process.  This unfavorable price variance was partially offset by a $6.3 million volume decrease

compared to the same period in the prior year as   DP L   no longer purchases power to source DPLER customers due to the sale of DPLER on January 1, 2016. This volume decrease was partially offset by increased purchases as   DP L   now sources 100% of SSO load through the competitive bid process in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015.    DPL   purchases power for the SSO load sourced through the competitive bid process and to serve auction load requirements in service territories other than   DP L's   territory. 

RTO charges   decreased $1.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of no longer having a   DP L   retail load obligation as a result of 100% SSO sales being sourced through the competitive auction.  The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the loads of other parties through their competitive bid process.  RTO charges are incurred by   DP L   as a member of PJM and primarily include costs associated with load obligations for retail customers. 

RTO capacity charges   decreased $31.8 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to   DP L   no longer having a retail load requirement in 2016, resulting from the SSO load being 100% sourced through competitive bid in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015 and resulting from the fact that   DP L   no longer provides power to DPLER in 2016.  The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the load of other parties through their competitive bid process.  As noted in the revenue section above, RTO capacity prices are set through PJM's annual auction. 

Mark-to-market losses   decreased $4.4 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to less significant decreases in power prices in the three month period ended September 30, 2016, causing lower losses on derivative forward power purchase contracts.    
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Cost of Revenues   decreased $124.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year: 

Net fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs,   increased $3.8 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a 5.5% increase in internal generation, partially offset by a 1.7% decrease in average fuel cost per MWh.  

Net purchased power   decreased $128.0 million   compared to the same period in the prior year.  This decrease was driven by the following factors: 

Purchased power   decreased $25.9 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a $51.2 million volume decrease as   DP L   no longer purchases power to source DPLER customers due to the sale of DPLER on January 1, 2016.  This was partially offset by increased purchases as   DP L   now sources 100% of SSO load through the competitive bid process in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015.    DPL   purchases power for the SSO load sourced through the competitive bid process and to serve auction load requirements in service territories other than   DP L's  .  The decrease in volume was offset by an unfavorable price variance of $25.3 million driven by higher prices in the competitive bid process. 

RTO charges   decreased $19.3 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of no longer having a   DP L   retail load obligation as a result of 100% SSO sales being sourced through the competitive auction.  The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the loads of other parties through their competitive bid process.  RTO charges are incurred by   DP L   as a member of PJM and primarily include costs associated with load obligations for retail customers. 

RTO capacity charges   decreased $75.5 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to   DP L   no longer having a retail load requirement in 2016, resulting from the SSO load being 100% sourced through competitive bid in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015 and resulting from the fact that   DP L   no longer provides power to DPLER in 2016.

DPL   Operation and Maintenance 
  The following table provides a summary of changes in Operation and maintenance expense from the prior year periods:   

(a) 
    There is a corresponding offset in Revenues associated with these programs. 
       
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Operation and maintenance expense   decreased $4.3 million   compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  This variance was primarily the result of: 
             
    decreased storm costs, which were recognized in 2015 as they were recovered through customer rates;  
                
    decreased maintenance expenses at our generating facilities; 
                
    decreased expenses due to the reversal of the Economic Development Fund expense, resulting from the withdrawal of ESP 2;  
                
    decreased retirement benefits; and 
                
    decreased maintenance of overhead transmission and distribution lines. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    increased expenses related to alternative energy and energy efficiency programs, which have a corresponding offset in Revenues associated with these programs;  
                
    increased expenses for the low-income payment program, which is funded by the USF revenue rate rider; and 
                
    increased group insurance/long-term disability expenses. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Operation and maintenance expense   decreased $10.2 million  , compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  This variance was primarily the result of: 
             
    decreased storm costs, which were recognized in 2015 as they were recovered through customer rates; 
                
    decreased maintenance expenses at our generating facilities; 
                
    decreased group insurance/long-term disability expenses associated with participation in the AES self-insurance plan; 
                
    decreased expenses due to the reversal of the Economic Development Fund expense, resulting from the withdrawal of ESP 2; and

decreased retirement benefits. 
     These decreases were offset by: 
             
    increased expenses related to alternative energy and energy efficiency programs, which have a corresponding offset in Revenues associated with these programs; 
                
    increased expenses for the low-income payment program, which is funded by the USF revenue rate rider; and 
                
    increased maintenance of overhead transmission and distribution lines, due to storms. 
       
  DPL   Depreciation and Amortization  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased $2.9 million     compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the fixed asset impairment in June 2016, which reduced depreciation expense due to the lower asset values. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased $0.6 million     compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the fixed asset impairment in June 2016, which reduced depreciation expense due to the lower asset values.  This was partially offset by an increase in the ARO for asbestos removal and remediation at the closed Beckjord plant. As this plant is no longer in operation, the entire impact of the adjustment was recorded as depreciation expense. 
    
  DPL   General Taxes  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , General taxes did not change significantly from the same period in the prior year.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , General taxes   decreased $2.5 million   compared to the same period in the prior year.  This decrease primarily resulted from a $1.6 million true-up of the 2015 Ohio property tax accrual to reflect actual payments made in 2016, as well as lower 2016 Commercial Activities Tax resulting from lower taxable revenue. 
    
  DPL   Fixed-asset Impairment 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   DPL   recorded an impairment of fixed assets of   $235.5 million  .  The ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio on June 20, 2016, lower expectation of future capacity revenue resulting from the most recent PJM capacity auction and a higher anticipated level of environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be an impairment indicator for these assets.    DPL   performed a long-lived asset impairment test and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups of Killen and certain   DP L   peaking generating facilities were not recoverable.    For more information, see   Note 14   Fixed-asset Impairment   of Notes to   DPL's   Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  DPL   Charge for Early Redemption of Debt 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the charge for early redemption of debt decreased $1.6 million due to the refinancing of   DP L's   revolving credit facility and pollution control bonds in the same period in the prior year. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the charge for early redemption of debt increased $1.0 million primarily due to the February 2016 make-whole premium of $2.4 million associated with the early retirement of $73.0 million of the 6.5% Senior Notes due in 2016. 
    
  DPL   Interest Expense 
  Interest expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.9 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to debt repayments at   DPL   and   DP L  , as well as decreased interest rates on   DP L s   senior secured pollution control bonds and reduced carrying costs on regulatory assets. 
    
  DPL   Income Tax Expense 
  During the three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Income tax expense   increased $14.1 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax income and an anticipated refund from the IRS for the filing, in the prior year, of an amended 2011 tax return for the predecessor company.

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Income tax expense   decreased $90.4 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a pre-tax loss in the current year. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   DP L 
    
  Income Statement Highlights   DP L 

(a) 
    For purposes of discussing operating results, we present and discuss gross margins.  This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends and includes the same information used by management to make decisions regarding our financial performance. 
       
  DP L   Revenues 
  Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days.  Therefore,   DP L s   retail sales volume is impacted by the number of heating and cooling degree days occurring during a year. 
    
  The wholesale market covers a multi-state area and settles on an hourly basis throughout the year.  Factors impacting   DP L s   wholesale sales volume each hour throughout the year include: wholesale market prices, retail demand throughout the entire wholesale market area,   DP L   and non-  DP L   plants  availability to sell into the wholesale market and weather conditions across the multi-state region.    DP L s   plan is to make wholesale sales when market prices allow for the economic operation of its generation facilities.

The following table provides a summary of changes in revenues from the prior period: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Revenues   decreased $20.8 million   to   $368.4 million   from   $389.2 million   in the same period in the prior year.    This decrease was primarily the result of lower average retail rates and lower average wholesale rates, partially offset by higher retail volume and higher wholesale volume.    The changes in the components of revenue are discussed below: 

Retail revenues   decreased $5.9 million     primarily due to lower average retail rates.  The decrease in retail rates is primarily driven by decreased retail revenue from SSO customers as the competitive auction rate, which represents 100% of   DP L   SSO load in 2016 as compared to 60% in 2015, is lower than our non-auction generation rate.    Warmer summer weather in 2016 contributed to the volume increase as cooling degree days increased by 237.    The aforementioned impacts resulted in   an unfavorable $21.6 million   retail price variance and   a favorable $16.5 million   retail volume variance.  There was also   an unfavorable other miscellaneous variance of $0.8 million  . 

Wholesale revenues   decreased $11.0 million     primarily as a result of   an unfavorable $20.3 million   wholesale price variance and   a favorable $9.3 million   wholesale volume variance.    The price decrease of $20.3 million was primarily due to lower market prices in 2016 and higher prices on sales to DPLER in 2015.  This price decrease was partially offset by a favorable wholesale volume variance due to the fact that   DP L   had excess generation available to be sold in the wholesale market in 2016 resulting from 100% of its SSO load being served through the competitive bid process compared to 60% during 2015.  In addition, there was a 10.2% increase in internal generation from   DP L's   co-owned and operated plants in 2016 compared to the prior year.  This favorable wholesale volume variance was partially offset by a decrease in volume due to the contract termination with DPLER, as   DP L   previously had full requirements sales to DPLER in 2015.  

RTO capacity and other revenues, consisting primarily of compensation for use of   DP L s   transmission assets, regulation services, reactive supply and operating reserves, and capacity payments under the RPM construct,   decreased $3.9 million  .    This decrease was primarily the result of a $1.2 million decrease in RTO transmission and congestion revenue and a $2.7 million decrease in revenue realized from the PJM capacity auction due to lower capacity cleared in the auction.    The capacity prices that became effective in June 2016 were $59/MW-day under the base RPM auction and $134/MW-day for the transitional CP auction, compared to $136/MW-day in June 2015.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   Revenues   decreased $171.3 million   to   $1,031.3 million   from   $1,202.6 million   in the same period in the prior year.    This decrease was primarily the result of lower average retail rates, lower average wholesale rates, and lower wholesale volume, partially offset by higher retail volume.    The changes in the components of revenue are discussed below: 

Retail revenues   decreased $53.4 million     primarily due to lower average retail rates.  The decrease in retail rates is primarily driven by decreased retail revenue from SSO customers as the competitive auction rate, which represents 100% of   DP L   SSO load in 2016 as compared to 60% in 2015, is lower than our non-auction generation rate.    Warmer weather in 2016 contributed to the volume increase as cooling degree days increased by 127 along with increased sales to commercial and industrial customers.    The aforementioned impacts resulted in   an unfavorable $69.1 million   retail price variance and   a favorable $13.6 million   retail volume variance.  In addition, there was   a favorable other miscellaneous variance of $2.1 million  . 

Wholesale revenues   decreased $104.2 million     primarily as a result of   an unfavorable $84.4 million   wholesale price variance and   an unfavorable $19.8 million   wholesale volume variance.  The price decrease of $84.4 million was primarily due to lower market prices in 2016 and higher prices on sales to DPLER in 2015.    Although   DP L   had excess generation available to be sold in the wholesale market in 2016 resulting from 100% of its SSO load being served through the competitive bid process compared to 60% during 2015,   DP L   had a decrease in volume due to the contract termination with DPLER, as   DP L   previously had full requirements sales to DPLER in 2015  .  

RTO capacity and other revenues, consisting primarily of compensation for use of   DP L s   transmission assets, regulation services, reactive supply and operating reserves, and capacity payments under the RPM construct,   decreased $13.6 million  .      This decrease was the result of a $6.4 million decrease in RTO transmission and congestion revenue, as 2015 congestion revenue charges were higher due to the fact that the winter weather was milder in 2016 than 2015.  There was also a $7.2 million decrease in revenue realized from the PJM capacity auction in 2016 due to plant outages in the first quarter and lower capacity cleared in the auction.      The capacity prices that became effective in June 2016 were $59/MW-day under the base RPM auction and $134/MW-day for the transitional CP auction, compared to $136/MW-day in June 2015 and $126/MW-day in June 2014.  
       
  DP L   Cost of Revenues  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Cost of Revenues   decreased $30.5 million   compared to the same period in the prior year: 

Net fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs,   increased $2.0 million     primarily due to a 10.2% increase in internal generation, partially offset by a 5.5% decrease in average fuel cost per MWh. 

Net purchased power   decreased $32.5 million   compared to the prior year.  This decrease was driven by the following factors: 

Purchased power   increased $3.2 million   compared to the same period in the prior year   primarily due to a $9.9 million price increase driven by higher prices in the competitive bid process. This price increase was partially offset by a volume decrease of $6.7 million.  The volume decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that   DP L   no longer purchases power to source DPLER customers due to the DPLER contract termination associated with the sale of DPLER by   DPL   on January 1, 2016. The volume decrease due to the contract termination was partially offset by increased purchases as   DP L   now sources 100% of SSO load through the competitive bid process in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015.    DP L   purchases power for the SSO load sourced through the competitive bid process   and to serve auction load requirements in service territories other than   DP L's  . 

RTO charges   decreased $1.3 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of no longer having a   DP L   retail load obligation as a result of 100% SSO sales being sourced through the competitive auction.      The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the loads of other parties through their competitive bid process.    RTO charges are incurred as a member of PJM and primarily include costs associated with load obligations for retail customers.

RTO capacity charges   decreased $30.1 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily   due to   DP L   no longer having a retail load requirement in 2016, resulting from the SSO load being 100% sourced through competitive bid in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015 and resulting from the fact that   DP L   no longer provides power to DPLER in 2016.    The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the load of other parties through their competitive bid process.    As noted in the revenue section above, RTO capacity prices are set by an annual auction. 

Mark-to-market losses   decreased $4.3 million   compared to the same period in the prior year due to less significant decreases in power prices in the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , causing lower losses on derivative forward power purchase contracts. 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Cost of Revenues   decreased $123.7 million   compared to the same period in the prior year: 

Net fuel costs, which include coal, gas, oil and emission allowance costs,   increased $0.6 million  , compared to the same period in the prior year   primarily due to a 2.4% increase in internal generation, partially offset by   $4.2 million of increased gains from coal sales.  

Net purchased power   decreased $124.3 million   compared to the prior year.  This decrease was driven by the following factors: 

Purchased power   decreased $26.3 million   compared to the same period in the prior year   primarily due to a $51.5 million volume decrease largely attributable to the fact that   DP L   no longer purchases power to source DPLER customers due to the DPLER contract termination associated with the sale of DPLER by   DPL   on January 1, 2016. The decrease in volume due to the sale of DPLER was partially offset by increased purchases as   DP L   now sources 100% of SSO load through the competitive bid process in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015.    DP L   purchases power for the SSO load sourced through the competitive bid process   and to serve auction load requirements in service territories other than   DP L's  .  The decrease in volume was also partially offset by an unfavorable price variance of $25.2 million   driven by prices in the competitive bid process  . 

RTO charges   decreased $16.7 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of no longer having a   DP L   retail load obligation as a result of 100% SSO sales being sourced through the competitive auction.      The remaining charges primarily relate to serving the loads of other parties through their competitive bid process.    RTO charges are incurred as a member of PJM and primarily include costs associated with load obligations for retail customers. 

RTO capacity charges   decreased $74.0 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily   due to   DP L   no longer having a retail load requirement in 2016, resulting from the SSO load being 100% sourced through competitive bid in 2016 as opposed to 60% in 2015 and resulting from the fact that   DP L   no longer provides power to DPLER in 2016.

DP L   Operation and Maintenance 
  The following table provides a summary of changes in Operation and maintenance expense from the prior year periods:   

(a) 
    There is a corresponding offset in Revenues associated with these programs. 
       
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Operation and maintenance expense   decreased $8.0 million  , compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  This variance was primarily the result of: 
             
    decreased storm costs, which were recognized in 2015 as they were recovered through customer rates; 
                
    decreased maintenance expenses at our generating facilities; 
                
    insurance recoveries from MVIC;

This decrease primarily resulted from a $1.6 million true-up of the 2015 Ohio property tax accrual to reflect actual payments made in 2016, as well as lower 2016 Commercial Activities Tax resulting from lower taxable revenue. 
    
  DP L   Fixed-asset Impairment 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L   recorded an impairment of fixed assets of $857.1 million. The   ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio on June 20, 2016, lower expectation of future capacity revenue resulting from the most recent PJM capacity auction and a higher anticipated level of environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be an impairment indicator for these assets.   DP L   performed a long-lived asset impairment test and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups of Stuart, Killen and Zimmer were not recoverable.  For more information, see   Note 12   Fixed-asset Impairment   of Notes to   DP L's   Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  DP L   Charge for Early Redemption of Debt 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the charge for early redemption of debt decreased $4.5 million primarily due to the refinancing of   DP L's   revolving credit facility and pollution control bonds in the same periods in the prior year. 
    
  DP L   Interest Expense 
  Interest expense during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $0.4 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.  This decrease was primarily due to debt repayments at   DP L  , as well as decreased interest rates on   DP L s   senior secured pollution control bonds and reduced carrying costs on regulatory assets. 
    
  DP L   Income Tax Expense 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Income tax expense   increased $18.9 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax income and an anticipated refund from the IRS for the filing, in the prior year, of an amended 2011 tax return for the predecessor company.

     Table of Contents  

During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Income tax expense   decreased $296.6 million   compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a pre-tax loss in the current year. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
    
  DPL s   financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements include the results of its principal subsidiary   DP L  .  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The significant items that have affected the cash flows for   DPL   and   DP L   are discussed in greater detail below: 
    
  DPL - Cash flows     from     operating activities 
  The revenue from our utility business continues to be the principal source of cash from operating activities while our primary uses of cash include payments for fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance expenses, interest and taxes.    Net cash provided by operating activities     decreased $61.8 million   to   $198.6 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $260.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This was primarily driven by a decrease in net income / (loss) adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, gain on sale of business, and fixed-asset impairment) of $47.3 million, as well as unfavorable changes in net working capital. 
    
  DP L - Cash flows     from     operating activities 
  The revenue from our utility business continues to be the principal source of cash from operating activities while our primary uses of cash include payments for fuel, purchased power, operation and maintenance expenses, interest and taxes.    Net cash provided by operating activities     decreased $27.3 million   to   $220.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $247.7 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  This change was primarily driven by unfavorable changes in working capital. 
    
  DPL - Cash flows from investing activities 
  Capital expenditures, primarily related to transmission and distribution, continue to be our principal use of cash related to investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities     decreased $66.1 million   to   $(23.1) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $(89.2) million  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by $75.5 million in proceeds from the sale of DPLER in January 2016, which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $16.3 million, related primarily to transmission and distribution activities. 
    
  DP L - Cash flows from investing activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities     increased $2.7 million   to   $(86.6) million   in the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $(83.9) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of $7.1 million, related primarily to transmission and distribution activities, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase due to the change in restricted cash. 
    
  DPL - Cash flows from financing activities 
     Net cash used in financing activities   was   $(86.1) million   in the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $(145.2) million   from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .    This was due to the redemption of $73.0 million of   DPL's   $130.0 million 6.5% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2016, the related make-whole payment of $2.4 million, and deferred financing cost payments of $8.0 million. 
    
  DP L - Cash flows from financing activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities   was   $(86.6) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $(158.5) million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to higher net debt payments in the prior year. 
    
  Liquidity 
  We expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs.  Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and carrying costs, potential margin requirements related to energy hedges and dividend payments.  In   2016   and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations and funds from debt financing as internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant.  We also expect that the borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities will continue to be available to us to manage working capital requirements during these periods.

DP L s   $445 million 1.875% Taxable First Mortgage Bonds due September 15, 2016 were refinanced prior to maturity   with a $445 million variable rate Term Loan B maturing on August 24, 2022  . 
    
  DPL's   $57.0 million senior secured notes matured on October 15, 2016 and were redeemed with cash on hand. 
    
  At the filing date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q,   DP L   and   DPL   have access to the following revolving credit facilities: 

DP L   has an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicated bank group with a borrowing limit of   $175.0 million and a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit, as well as a feature that provides   DP L   the ability to increase the size of the facility by an additional $100.0 million.  This facility expires in July 2020.    At the filing date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q,   DP L   had drawn $15.0 million under this facility and had two letters of credit in the amount of $1.4 million outstanding, with the remaining   $158.6 million   available to   DP L  .  Fees associated with this letter of credit facility were not material during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  DPL   has a revolving credit facility of $205.0 million, with a $200.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a feature that provides   DPL   the ability to increase the size of the facility by an additional $95.0 million.    This facility is secured by a pledge of common stock that   DPL   owns in   DP L  , limited to the amount permitted to be pledged under certain Indentures dated October 3, 2011 and October 6, 2014 between   DPL   and Wells Fargo Bank, NA and U.S. Bank National Association, respectively, as Trustee and a limited recourse guarantee by   AES Ohio Generation   secured by assets of   AES Ohio Generation  .      DPL   further secured the credit facility through a leasehold mortgage on additional assets of AES Ohio Generation.  The facility expires in July 2020; however,   DPL's   credit facility has a springing maturity feature providing that if, before July 1, 2019,   DPL   has not refinanced its senior unsecured bonds due October 2019 to have a maturity date that is at least six months later than July 31, 2020, then the maturity of this facility shall be July 1, 2019.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were two letters of credit in the amount of $1.8 million outstanding under this facility, with the remaining   $203.2 million   available to   DPL  .  Fees associated with this facility were not material during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents for   DPL   and   DP L   amounted to   $121.8 million   and   $92.9 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  .  At that date, neither   DPL   nor   DP L   had any short-term investments that were not included in cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  Capital Requirements 
  Planned construction additions for   2016   relate primarily to new investments in and upgrades to   DP L s   power plant equipment and transmission and distribution system.  Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments and changing environmental requirements, among other factors. 
    
  DPL   is projecting to spend an estimated   $437.0 million   in capital projects for the period   2016   through   2018  , of which   $310.0 million   is projected to be spent by   DP L  .    DP L   is subject to the mandatory reliability standards of NERC and Reliability First Corporation (RFC), one of the eight NERC regions of which   DP L   is a member.    DP L   anticipates spending approximately   $6.7 million   within the next five years to reinforce its 138 kV system to comply with NERC standards.      Our ability to complete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by our financial condition, the availability of internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds.  We expect to finance our construction additions with a combination of cash on hand, short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows from operations. 
    
  Debt Covenants 
  The   DPL   revolving credit facility and the   DPL   term loan agreement have a Total Debt to EBITDA covenant that will be calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing total debt at the end of the current quarter by consolidated EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters.  The ratio in the agreements is not to exceed 7.25 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2018; it then steps down not to exceed 6.25 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 through December 31, 2019; and it then steps down not to

     Table of Contents  

exceed 5.75 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 through July 31, 2020.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the financial covenant was met with a ratio of 5.40 to 1.00. 
    
  The   DPL   revolving credit facility and the   DPL   term loan agreement also have an EBITDA to Interest Expense covenant that is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter by dividing consolidated EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters by the consolidated interest charges for the same period.  The ratio, per the agreements, is to be not less than 2.10 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2018; it then steps up to be not less than 2.25 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 through July 31, 2020.  As of   September 30, 2016  , this financial covenant was met with a ratio of 3.33 to 1.00. 
    
  DP L s   revolving credit facility   and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement   have two financial covenants.  Prior to the date of completion of the separation of   DP L s   generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets  ,   DP L s   Total Debt to Total Capitalization ratio may not be greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time; and, on and after the date of completion of the separation of   DP L s   generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets  ,    DP L s   Total debt to Total Capitalization ratio may not be greater than 0.75 to 1.00 at any time, except that (a)   this covenant shall be suspended between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, if during this same time   DP L s   long-term indebtedness (as determined by the PUCO) is less than or equal to $750.0 million or (b) this financial covenant shall be suspended at any time   DP L   maintains a rating of BBB- (or in the case of Moody s Baa3) or higher with a stable outlook from at least one of Fitch Investors Service Inc., Standard   Poor s Ratings Services or Moody s Investors Service, Inc., as determined in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   DP L   met this financial covenant with a ratio of 0.50 to 1.00.  This covenant is calculated as the sum of   DP L s   current and long-term portion of debt, divided by the total of   DP L s   shareholder s equity and total debt. 
    
  The   DP L   revolving credit facility and Bond Purchase and Covenants Agreement also have an EBITDA to Interest Expense financial covenant that will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters by the interest charges for the same period.  Both prior to and after   completion of the separation of   DP L s   generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets,   DP L s     EBITDA to Interest Expense   cannot be less than 2.50 to 1.00.    A  s of   September 30, 2016  , this covenant was met with a ratio of 13.66 to 1.00.

  If the rating agencies were to reduce our debt or credit ratings, our borrowing costs may increase, our potential pool of investors and funding resources may be reduced, and we may be required to post additional collateral under selected contracts.  These events may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, any such reduction in our debt or credit ratings may adversely affect the trading price of our outstanding debt securities.

MARKET RISK 
    
  We are subject to certain market risks including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices for electricity, coal, environmental emissions and gas, changes in capacity prices and fluctuations in interest rates.  We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to limit our exposure to fluctuations in commodity pricing.  Our Commodity Risk Management Committee (CRMC), comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for establishing risk management policies and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures relating to our generation units.  The CRMC meets on a regular basis with the objective of identifying, assessing and quantifying material risk issues and developing strategies to manage these risks. 
    
  Commodity Pricing Risk 
  Commodity pricing risk exposure includes the impacts of weather, market demand, increased competition and other economic conditions.  To manage the volatility relating to these exposures at our   DP L  -operated generation units, we use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments including forward contracts and futures contracts.  These instruments are used principally for economic hedging purposes and none are held for trading purposes.  Derivatives that fall within the scope of derivative accounting under GAAP must be recorded at their fair value and marked to market unless they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.  MTM gains and losses on derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are deferred in AOCI until the forecasted transactions occur.  We adjust the derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedging to fair value on a monthly basis through the Statement of Operations or, where applicable, we recognize a corresponding Regulatory asset for above-market costs or a Regulatory liability for below-market costs in accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP. 
    
  The coal market has increasingly been influenced by both international and domestic supply and consumption, making the price of coal more volatile than in the past, and while we have substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for   2016   under contract; sales requirements may change.  The majority of the contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices. Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments.  Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, the wholesale market price of power, certain provisions in coal contracts related to government imposed costs, counterparty performance and credit, scheduled outages and generation plant mix. 
    
  For purposes of potential risk analysis, we use a sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts of market rate changes on the statements of results of operations.  The sensitivity analysis represents hypothetical changes in market values that may or may not occur in the future. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives 
  To minimize the risk of fluctuations in the market price of commodities, such as coal, power, natural gas and heating oil, we may enter into commodity-forward and futures contracts to effectively hedge the cost/revenues of the commodity.  Maturity dates of the contracts are scheduled to coincide with market purchases/sales of the commodity.  Cash proceeds or payments between the counter-party and us at maturity of the contracts are recognized as an adjustment to the cost of the commodity purchased or sold.  We generally do not enter into forward contracts beyond thirty-six months. 
    
  A 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our FTRs and natural gas futures at   September 30, 2016   would not have a significant effect on Net income. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , a 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our forward power purchase contracts would result in an impact on unrealized gains/losses of $6.0 million, while a 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our forward power sale contracts would result in an impact on unrealized gains/losses of $5.0 million.

Wholesale Revenues 
  Energy in excess of contracted obligations is sold in the wholesale spot market when we can identify opportunities with positive margins.    DP L s   electric revenues in the wholesale market include sales to DPLER in 2015.  The following table presents the percentages of   DPL s   and   DP L s   electric revenue derived from wholesale sales. 

The following table presents the effect on annual Net income (net of estimated income taxes at 35%) as of   September 30, 2016  , of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the price per MWh of wholesale power: 

Capacity Revenues and Costs 
  As a member of PJM,   DP L   receives revenues from the RTO related to its transmission and generation assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers.  PJM, which has a delivery year that runs from June 1 to May 31, has conducted auctions for capacity through the delivery year.  The clearing prices for capacity during the PJM delivery periods from   2015/16   through   2019/20   are as follows: 

Our computed average capacity prices by calendar year are reflected in the following table: 

The above tables reflect the capacity prices after the transitional auctions discussed earlier.  Substantially all of   DP L's   capacity cleared in the CP auction.  The results of these auctions could have a significant effect on   DP L's   revenues in the future. 
    
  Future RPM auction results are dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion and PJM s RPM business rules.  The volatility in the RPM capacity auction pricing has had and will continue to have a significant impact on   DPL s   capacity revenues and costs. 
    
  The following table provides estimates of the effect on annual Net income (net of estimated income taxes at 35%) as of   September 30, 2016   of a hypothetical increase or decrease of $10/MW-day in the RPM auction price. The table shows the impact resulting from capacity revenue changes.  We did not include the impact of a change in the RPM capacity costs since these costs will be recovered through the development of our overall energy pricing for customers.

Capacity revenues and costs are also impacted by, among other factors, our generation capacity, the levels of wholesale revenues and our retail customer load.  In determining the capacity price sensitivity above, we did not consider the impact that may arise from the variability of these other factors.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs 
  DPL s   and   DP L s   fuel (including coal, gas, oil and emission allowances) and purchased power costs as a percentage of total operating costs in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   39%   and   26%  , respectively.  We have a significant portion of projected   2016   fuel needs under contract.  The majority of our contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices although some contracts provide for periodic pricing adjustments.  We may purchase SO   2      allowances for   2016  , however, the exact consumption of SO   2      allowances will depend on market prices for power, availability of our generation units and the actual sulfur content of the coal burned.  We may purchase some NO  x   allowances for   2016   depending on NO  x   emissions.  Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, reliability of coal deliveries, scheduled outages and generation plant mix. 
    
  Purchased power costs depend, in part, upon the timing and extent of planned and unplanned outages of our generating capacity.  We will purchase power on a discretionary basis when wholesale market conditions provide opportunities to obtain power at a cost below our internal generation costs. 
    
  The following table provides the effect on annual Net income (net of estimated income taxes at 35%) as of   September 30, 2016   of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the prices of fuel and purchased power: 

Interest Rate Risk 
  As a result of our normal investing and borrowing activities, our financial results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage through our regular financing activities.  We maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents that may be affected by adverse interest rate fluctuations.    DPL   and   DP L   have both fixed-rate and variable-rate long-term debt.    DPL s   variable-rate debt consists of a $125.0 million term loan with a syndicated bank group.  The term loan interest rate fluctuates with changes in an underlying interest rate index, typically LIBOR.    DP L s   variable-rate debt is comprised of bank held pollution control bonds and a variable rate term loan B.  The variable-rate bonds and term loan B bear interest based on an underlying interest rate index, typically LIBOR.  Market indexes can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other economic conditions.  See   Note 6   Debt   of Notes to   DPL s   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and   Note 6   Debt   of Notes to   DP L s   Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  Principal Payments and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Date  
  The principal value of   DPL s   debt was   $1,940.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , consisting of   DPL s   unsecured notes and unsecured term loan, along with   DP L s   first mortgage bonds, tax-exempt pollution control bonds and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base note.  All of   DPL s   debt was adjusted to fair value at the date of the Merger.  The fair value of this debt at   September 30, 2016   was   $1,969.4 million  , based on current market prices or discounted cash flows using current rates for similar issues with similar terms and remaining maturities.

  Long-term Debt Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis 
  Our estimate of market risk exposure is presented for our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt at   September 30, 2016   for which an immediate adverse market movement causes a potential material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or the fair value of the debt.  We believe that the adverse market movement represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. 
    
  The following tables present the carrying value and fair value of our debt, along with the impact of a change of one percent in interest rates: 

DPL s   debt is comprised of both fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt.  In regard to fixed-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to   DPL s   long-term debt primarily relates to the potential impact a decrease of one percentage

point in interest rates has on the fair value of   DPL s     $1,199.4 million   of fixed-rate debt and not on   DPL s   financial condition or results of operations.  On the variable-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to   DPL s   long-term debt represents the potential impact an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate has on   DPL s   results of operations related to   DPL s     $770.0 million   variable-rate long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  DP L s   interest rate risk with respect to   DP L s   long-term debt primarily relates to the potential impact a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point has on the fair value of   DP L s     $118.5 million   of fixed-rate debt and not on   DP L s   financial condition or   DP L s   results of operations.  On the variable-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to   DP L s   long-term debt represents the potential impact an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate has on   DP L s   results of operations related to   DP L s     $645.0 million   variable-rate long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Credit Risk 
  Credit risk is the risk of an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any investment contract, loan agreement or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk arises from all activities in which success depends on issuer, borrower or counterparty performance, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet.  We limit our credit risk by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continue to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been originated.  We use the three leading corporate credit rating agencies and other current market-based qualitative and quantitative data to assess the financial strength of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.  We may require various forms of credit assurance from our counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  DPL s   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and   DP L s   Condensed Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.  Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. 
    
  Different estimates could have a material effect on our financial results.  Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances.  Historically, however, recorded estimates have not differed materially from actual results.  Significant items subject to such judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; liabilities recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; assets and liabilities related to employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets.  Refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a complete listing of our critical accounting policies and estimates.  There have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies and estimates.

Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures.  These controls and procedures were designed to ensure that material information relating to us and our subsidiaries is communicated to the CEO and CFO.  We evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report with the participation of our CEO and CFO.  Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  .  In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) in 2013.  There were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Management and our Board of Directors are committed to the continued improvement of   DPL's   overall system of internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II   Other Information 

Item 1   Legal Proceedings 
    
  In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, claims, and other proceedings.

penalties, injunctions or other relief.  We have accrued in our Financial Statements for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  We believe the amounts provided in our Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, for these matters are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies.  However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims and other matters (including those matters noted below), and to comply with applicable laws and regulations will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Financial Statements.  As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided for in our Financial Statements, cannot be reasonably determined, but could be material. 
    
  Our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Forms10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, and March 31, 2016   and the Notes to   DPL s   Consolidated Financial Statements and   DP L s   Financial Statements included therein, contain descriptions of certain legal proceedings in which we are or were involved.  The information in or incorporated by reference into this Item 1 to Part II is limited to certain recent developments concerning our legal proceedings and new legal proceedings, since the filing of such   Forms 10-K and 10-Q  , and should be read in conjunction with such   Forms 10-K and 10-Q  . 
    
  The following information is incorporated by reference into this Item:  information about the legal proceedings contained in Part I, Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and   Note 3   Regulatory Matters   of Notes to   DPL's   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and   Note 3   Regulatory Matters   of Notes to   DP L's   Condensed Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  A listing of the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant to a decision to invest in our securities is provided in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K.

  The risks and uncertainties described in our risk factors are not the only ones we face. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance.  Our risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning   DPL   and   DP L   set forth in the Notes to   DPL s   and   DP L s   Financial Statements and the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  sections included in our filings.
