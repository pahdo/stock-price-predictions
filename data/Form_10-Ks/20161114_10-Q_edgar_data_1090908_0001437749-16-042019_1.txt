DETERMINE, INC.    
    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (UNAUDITED)   

1.  Basis of Presentation   
     
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) have been made to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2016, and the results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.    
     
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  
     
  On October 15, 2015, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated its Bylaws to change its name from Selectica, Inc. to Determine, Inc., which became effective immediately. The Company s common stock began trading under the ticker symbol  DTRM  on October 19, 2015.  

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
  There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. It also includes non-controlling interest, which is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable to a parent. The non-controlling interest of the Company and its subsidiaries are not considered to be permanent equity. Non-controlling interest s share of subsidiary earnings is reflected as net loss (income) attributable to non-controlling interest in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additionally, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The reclassification of the prior period amounts were not material to the previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Liquidity   
     
  The Company has incurred significant historical losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of $308 million at September 30, 2016. Until the Company can generate significant cash from operations, its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. Management intends to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt offerings until the Company has positive operating cash flows. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in generating or raising funds, if necessary, to sustain its operations for twelve months or beyond. Should the Company be unable to generate funds or obtain future financing, the Company may have to curtail operations by delaying development programs or relinquishing employees, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  
     
   Use of Estimates   
     
  The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to the accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, best estimate of selling price, income taxes and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition   
     
  The Company generates revenues by providing its software-as-a-service solutions through subscription license arrangements and related professional services, and related software maintenance. The Company presents revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.  
     
   Revenue recognition criteria . The Company recognizes revenue when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) fees are fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. If the Company determines that any one of the four criteria is not met, the Company will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are met.  
       
   Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements.  The Company enters into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, support and professional services. If a deliverable has standalone value, and delivery is probable and within the Company s control, the Company accounts for the deliverable as a separate unit of accounting. Subscriptions to use its software solutions have standalone value as such services are often sold separately, primarily through renewals. Professional services have standalone value as the services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and are available from other vendors.  
     
  Upon separating the multiple-deliverables into separate units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of the selling price ( VSOE ), if available, or its best estimate of the selling price ( BESP ), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.  
     
  For professional services and subscription services, the Company has not established VSOE due to lack of pricing consistency and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price.  
     
  The Company determined BESP by considering its price list, as well as overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company s discounting practices, contract prices per user, the size and volume of the Company s transactions, the customer demographic and its market strategy.  
     
   Recurring revenues.  Recurring revenues consist of subscription license sales and services, maintenance revenues from previously sold perpetual licenses and hosting revenues. Recurring revenues are recognized ratably over the stated contractual period.  
     
   Non-recurring revenues.   Non-recurring revenues are comprised of revenues from professional services for system implementations, enhancements and training. For professional services arrangements billed on a time-and-materials basis, services are recognized as revenue as they are rendered. For fixed-fee professional service arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue under the proportional performance method of accounting and estimates the proportional performance utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion, revenue is recognized upon completion. The Company recognizes a loss for a fixed-fee professional service if the total estimated project costs exceed project revenues.  
     
  Reimbursements, including those related to travel and out-of-pocket expenses are included in non-recurring revenues, and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in non-recurring cost of revenues.  
     
   Customer Concentrations   
     
  Historically, a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company s revenues. However, during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenues or net accounts receivable, respectively.   
     
   Geographic Information   
     
  International revenues are attributable to countries based on the location of the customer. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, sales to international locations were derived primarily from France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Singapore, Bermuda, the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Denmark, China, Hong Kong, India and New Zealand.

As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company held long-lived assets outside of the United States with a net book value of approximately $6,000 and $13,000, respectively. These assets were located in Odessa, Ukraine.  
       
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory , which removes the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The update is effective for the Company beginning April 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230),  which addresses eight specific cash flow matters with the objective of reducing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606  ): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  .  The amendments in this ASU clarify the accounting for licenses of intellectual property, as well as the identification of distinct performance obligations in a contract and will be effective for the Company concurrently with ASU 2014-09,   for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that year. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods with that year. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation  -Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments simplify the accounting in various aspects for these types of transactions: i.e. Accounting for Income Taxes, Excess tax benefits on the Statements of Cash Flows, Forfeitures, Employee taxes and Intrinsic Value. The new guidance will be effective for the Company beginning on April 1, 2017 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,  providing guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new guidance does not change the accounting for a customer s accounting for service contracts. The standard update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is applicable to the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption of ASU 2015-03 is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.    ASU 2015-15 supplements the requirements of ASU 2015-03 by allowing an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement and was effective immediately. Retrospective adoption is required. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Subtopic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  to improve consolidation guidance for legal entities and affect the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations. The standard update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The standard allows for adoption retrospectively or with a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  The Company has reviewed other new accounting pronouncements that were issued as of September 30, 2016 and does not believe that these pronouncements are applicable to the Company, or that they will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

3.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
     
  The following is a summary of goodwill (in thousands):   

The following is a summary of other intangible assets, net (in thousands):   

Acquired developed technology and customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis and have weighted-average remaining useful lives of 3.49 years and 3.64 years, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. Amortization expense was $0.5 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

4. Property and Equipment, net   
        
  Property and equipment, net consist of the following:    

Depreciation expense was approximately $0.02 million and $0.05 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.05 million and $0.1 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

5.  Capitalized Software Development Costs   
     
  The Company capitalizes costs for internal use software incurred during the application development stage that are included in research and development expenses. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalized $0.4 million and $0.5 million of research and development costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.8 million during both the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Capitalized software is amortized once the product is ready for its intended use, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three years. Amortization expense is included in the product cost of revenue and was $0.3 million and $0.01 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.5 million and $0.1 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The unamortized balance of capitalized software was $1.9 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  
     
  Management continues to evaluate the capitalized software development costs across all product lines and did not identify any indicators which required impairment to be recorded during the six months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

6.    Convertible Preferred Stock   
     
  In February 2015, pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Agreement between the Company and certain institutional funds and other accredited investors, the Company sold and issued 118,829 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series F Stock ), as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.   
     
  On May 5, 2015, following approval by the Company s stockholders, each whole share of Series F Stock converted automatically into ten shares of common stock. The Company recognized accretion related to the Series F Stock through the conversion date during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  

7.  COFACE Loan

As part of the contract, COFACE financed part of the expenses in the United States, with the amounts to be amortized in subsequent years. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the amount still to be repaid was $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively.  

8 .  Equity   
     
    Equity Incentive Program    
     
  The Company s equity incentive program is a broad-based, retention program comprised of stock options, restricted stock units and an employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) designed to align stockholder and employee interests. For a description of the Company s equity plans, see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.

12

The following tables summarize activity under the equity incentive plans for the three months ended September 30, 2016:   

The weighted average remaining contractual term for exercisable options is 7.79 years. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value as of September 30, 2016 and the exercise price of the shares. The market value of the Company s common stock as of September 30, 2016 was $1.70 as reported by the NASDAQ Capital Market. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $6,300, respectively.

The effect of recording stock-based compensation expense (including expense related to the ESPP discussed below) for each of the periods presented was as follows (in thousands):  

Upon the departure of our CEO in June 2015, a nominal amount of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense was reversed due to the forfeiture of stock option grants. As of September 30, 2016, the unrecorded stock-based compensation balance related to stock options and restricted stock units outstanding excluding estimated forfeitures was $4.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.01 years for stock options and 1.87 years for restricted stock units. The amortization period is based on the expected remaining vesting term of the options and restricted stock units.  
     
    1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP )    
     
  The price paid for the Company s common stock purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each offering period. The compensation expense in connection with the ESPP for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $20,000 and $18,700, respectively, and approximately $49,000 and $33,700 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 46,604 and 24,115 shares issued under the ESPP.  

9  .  Computation of Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share   
     
  Basic and diluted net loss per share have been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  
       
  The Company excludes securities from its diluted net loss per share computation when their effect would be antidilutive to net loss per share amounts. The following common stock equivalents were excluded from the net loss per share computation:  

10.  Restructuring   
     
  The following is a summary of restructuring accrual (in thousands):  

14

Restructuring expenses consisted of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs incurred to improve the Company s cost structure prospectively. As part of the process of consolidating companies and moving forward with its unified platform strategy, the Company evaluated its operations for duplication of efforts and work not in full alignment with its strategy which resulted in the elimination of eleven positions.  These positions were primarily executives and included a direct report to the CEO.  The Company incurred these expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and all payments were made during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  

11  .  Operating Lease Commitments   
     
  In connection with the acquisition of Iasta, we assumed a lease for an office in Carmel, Indiana, which expired May 31, 2016. On April 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement with Atapco Carmel, Inc. for approximately 8,795 square feet of office space in a building located at 615 West Carmel Drive, Suite 100 in Carmel, Indiana. The term of the lease runs for approximately 51 months and provides for monthly rent payments of $11,727 per month for the first year of the term of the lease (with three of the months of the first-year term provided rent free), subject to annual adjustment thereafter.  
     
  In connection with the relocation of its headquarters to Carmel, Indiana, on July 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Lease with 2121 SEC TT, LLC (formerly SKBGS I, L.L.C.) to terminate its lease obligation at the San Mateo, California location as of July 31, 2016. The Company paid a one-time early termination fee equal to three months  rent which was partially offset by the security deposit refund due.  
     
  Rental expenses for office space were approximately $0.2 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

1  2  .  Litigation and Contingencies   
     
  From time to time, the Company is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of its business. The Company believes that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not materially affect its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   
         
  In March 2015, a minority stockholder of b-pack Services SA, a French subsidiary of Determine SAS, which was acquired when the Company acquired b-pack SAS, initiated litigation in the Nanterre Commercial Court against b-pack SAS and its founders claiming indemnification rights for his contribution to the business of b-pack Services SA and seeking monetary damages and other relief. The Nanterre Commercial Court declined jurisdiction and sent the matter to the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Nanterre, where it is currently pending. In July 2015, the same minority shareholder also initiated litigation in the Paris Commercial Court against Determine SAS to contest the merger between b-pack SAS and Selectica France SAS, which is also pending, and seeking monetary damages and other relief.  The Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. The Company did not record any provision as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  In November 2015, the Company settled outstanding litigation based upon claims the Company alleged against some of its former employees and a competitor relating to the Company s intellectual property. In April 2016, such competitor paid the Company the remaining settlement amount of $0.6 million which is reflected in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Warranties and Indemnifications   
     
  The Company s products are generally warranted to perform substantially in accordance with the functional specifications set forth in the associated product documentation for a period of at least 90 days. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, the Company generally is obligated to correct the product to conform to the product documentation or, if the Company is unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product or service. The Company has not provided for a warranty accrual as of September 30, 2016 or March 31, 2016. To date, the Company has not refunded any amounts in relation to the warranty.  
     
  The Company generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Company s software infringes certain third-party intellectual property rights. In the event of such a claim, the Company is obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at the Company s expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In addition, in the event of the infringement, the Company agrees to modify or replace the infringing product, or, if those options are not reasonably possible, to refund the purchase price of the software. To date, the Company has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against its customers. As such, the Company has not provided for an indemnification accrual as of September 30, 2016 or March 31, 2016.  

1  3  . Credit Facility   and   Convertible   Notes    
     
  The Company maintains financing facilities and convertible note purchase agreements. For a description of the Company s debt financing, see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  

15

On April 20, 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Determine Sourcing, Inc., entered into Amendment Number Seven to the Amended and Restated Business Financing Agreement with Western Alliance Bank, an Arizona corporation, as successor in interest to Bridge Bank, National Association. The Amendment extended the maturity date of the underlying credit facility to April 20, 2018.  
     
  In order to satisfy certain conditions for Western Alliance Bank to enter into the Amendment, on April 22, 2016, Lloyd I. Miller, III, the Company s largest stockholder, and his affiliates MILFAM II, L.P. and Alliance Semiconductor Corporation ( ALSC ), a Delaware corporation, each entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Guaranty with Western Alliance. The Amended Guaranties extended the term of the limited guaranties entered into by Mr. Miller and MILFAM with Western Alliance on March 11, 2015, and the limited guaranty entered into by ALSC with Western Alliance on February 3, 2016, to April 20, 2018.  
     
  On April 22, 2016, the Company and the Guarantors entered into a Second Amendment to 2015 Guaranty Fee Agreement and Amendment to 2016 Guaranty Fee Agreement (the  Fee Amendment ), which (i) further amended the Guaranty Fee Agreement, dated March 11, 2015, entered into by the Company, Mr. Miller and MILFAM and (ii) amended the Guaranty Fee Agreement, dated February 3, 2016, entered into by the Company and ALSC. Pursuant to the Fee Amendment, the term of the 2015 Fee Agreement and the 2016 Fee Agreement were extended to April 20, 2018. As a condition for extending the term of the Amended Guaranties as described above, the Company agreed to pay an additional cash fee of $76,000 to Mr. Miller and MILFAM, payable by the Company within five business days following the termination or expiration of the Amended Guaranties, and also agreed to pay certain fees and expenses of the Guarantors related to the Amended Guaranties.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company owed $10.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, and $1.1 million and $3.0 million was available for future borrowings, respectively. The Company s Credit Facility with Western Alliance contains certain financial covenants that require, among other things, the maintenance of an asset coverage ratio of not less than 2:00 to 1:00 at the end of each month. As of September 30, 2016, the Company met all the requirements and was in compliance.  

1  4  .  Income Taxes   
     
  The provision for income taxes is based upon loss before income taxes as follows (in thousands):  

The components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes are as follows (in thousands):  

The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold, measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. Under ASC 740, the Company is required to recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The Company policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.   
     
  At September 30, 2016, there was no material increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits nor any accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  
     
  In addition, at September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits which was netted against deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance. If these amounts are recognized, there will be no effect on the Company s effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance.  
     
  The Company s Federal, state and foreign tax returns may be subject to examination by the tax authorities for fiscal year ended from 1998 to 2015 due to net operating losses and tax carryforwards unutilized from such years.

15.  Related Party Transactions   
     
  Determine SAS and b-pack Services rent their offices from SCI Donapierre, the company controlled by two of the Company   s stockholders. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, Determine SAS made rental payments of approximately and $33,000 and $53,000, respectively, to SCI Donapierre.

    Quarterly Financial Overview    
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total revenues decreased by 3%, or $0.2 million, to $6.6 million compared with total revenues of $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Recurring revenues, comprised of subscription license sales and services, maintenance sales from previously sold perpetual licenses, application services management and hosting revenues, decreased to $5.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percent of total revenues, recurring revenues comprised 78% and 80% of total revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-recurring revenues, comprised of perpetual license sales and revenues from professional services for system implementations, enhancements and training, totaled $1.4 million, or 22% of total revenues, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 6%, over the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in total revenues year over year resulted primarily from decreased maintenance revenues, offset by increased revenues from professional services for system implementations.  
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss from operations decreased $0.6 million, or 18%, to $2.6 million, compared to $3.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss relates primarily to a decrease in our headcount during the three months ended September 30, 2016. See   Results of Operations   below for further discussion on the components of our net loss.  
     
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
     
  There have been no material changes to any of our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  

18

Results of Operations:    

Recurring revenues .  Recurring revenues consist of subscription license sales and services, maintenance revenues from previously sold perpetual licenses and hosting revenues.  The overall decrease in recurring revenues was driven by decreased maintenance revenues, offset by subscription revenue growth. Maintenance revenues were impacted by decreased renewals of previously sold perpetual licenses, while subscription revenues increased due to the acquisition of b-pack during the second quarter of 2015 and new customers we entered into contract with during the current periods.   
     
  Maintenance revenues were $0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015, a 38% decrease. Subscription revenues grew to $4.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a 7% increase. Maintenance revenues were $1.8 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2015, a 37% decrease. Subscription revenues grew to $8.2 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, representing a 10% increase.   
     
  Recurring revenues continue to account for over 75% of our total revenues, and we expect this trend to continue going forward as we continue to emphasize our cloud-based solutions. This will depend in part on the number of maintenance renewals, and the number and size of new subscription license contracts. In addition, maintenance renewals are extremely dependent upon economic conditions, customer satisfaction and the level of need to make changes or upgrade versions of our software by our customers.   
     
   Non-recurring revenues . Non-recurring revenues are comprised of revenues from professional services for system implementations, enhancements and training. Non-recurring revenues increased by $0.1 million, or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased by $0.4 million, or 16%, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of b-pack. We expect non-recurring revenues to continue to fluctuate in future periods as a percentage of total revenues and in absolute dollars. This will depend on the number and size of new software implementations and follow-on services to our existing customers.   
     
  Fluctuations in revenue are also due to the timing of revenue recognition, achievement of milestones, customer acceptance, changes in scope or renegotiated terms and additional services. In addition, we anticipate that as we continue to transition more of our business to our cloud-based solutions, revenue from our legacy software platforms will continue to taper.  
     
  Sales to foreign customers accounted for 26% and 28% of total revenues during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 18% and 14% of total revenues during the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The majority of these sales were denominated in US dollars. We do not anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will be significant in the foreseeable future.  
      
    Cost of revenues     

Cost of recurring revenues.  Cost of recurring revenues consists of costs associated with supporting our data center, a fixed allocation of our research and development costs and salaries and related expenses of our support organization. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of recurring revenues remained flat compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, cost of recurring revenues increased $0.1 million, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015, driven by the amortization of capitalized software, offset by a decrease in costs related to maintenance revenues.  

19

Cost of non-recurring revenues.  Cost of non-recurring revenues is comprised mainly of salaries and related expenses of our services organization, fees paid to resellers and certain allocated corporate expenses. During both the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, cost of non-recurring revenues increased $0.3 million, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, primarily due to labor costs associated with delivering our cloud-based solutions.   
     
  We expect cost of recurring and non-recurring revenues to remain relatively flat as a percentage of recurring revenues throughout the remainder of fiscal 2017.  
     
   Gross Profit Dollars and Margin   

Gross profit dollars decreased $0.4 million, or 10%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, during the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015. As we emphasize our cloud-based solutions, and move away from our legacy software platforms, our gross profit will fluctuate due to the timing between costs associated with deploying our new solutions and the related revenue recognition. Gross margins represent gross profit as a percentage of revenue and were affected by the factors discussed above under  Revenues  and  Costs of Revenues.   
     
  We expect that our overall gross margins will continue to fluctuate primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition. The impact on our gross margin will depend on the mix of services we provide, whether the services are performed by our professional services employees or third party consultants and the overall utilization rates of our professional services organization.  
     
    Operating Expenses    
     
   Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and related costs of our engineering, quality assurance, technical publication efforts and certain allocated expenses.  The increases of $0.2 million, or 18%, and $0.5 million, or 35%, during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, was due primarily to further development of our cloud-based solutions in line with our transition from our legacy software platforms. Additionally, during the six months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced increased expenses related to the acquisition of b-pack in July 2015.  
     
  We expect research and development expenditures to remain relatively flat during the remainder of fiscal 2017.  
     
   Sales and Marketing   

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our sales and marketing organization, sales commissions, expenses for travel and entertainment, sales materials, advertising and certain allocated expenses. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 20%, and $1.3 million, or 19%, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, due to lower headcount and commissions.   
     
  We expect sales and marketing expenses to remain flat during the remainder of fiscal 2017.  

20

General and Administrative   

General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, bad debt expense and certain allocated expenses.  General and administrative expense increased $0.1 million, or 7%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to costs associated with the movement of our headquarters from California to Indiana, offset by decreased legal activity in the current period when compared to the prior period. General and administrative expenses remained flat during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a gain in the settlement of an outstanding litigation, offset by increases resulting from the acquisition of b-pack in July 2015.  
     
  We expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat during the remainder of fiscal 2017.  
     
   Acquisition Related Costs   
       
  Acquisition related expenses during the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 consist mainly of legal and accounting related costs resulting from due diligence work performed for the acquisition of b-pack, which occurred in July 2015.   There were no acquisition related expenses during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016.  
       
   Other Expense, net   
     
  Other expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on the credit facility, foreign currency transaction fluctuations and other miscellaneous expenditures. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, other expense increased $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, when compared to the prior periods, due primarily to increased interest expense on our debt financing agreements, resulting from increased borrowings throughout the current period, as well as increased debt issuance costs related to amendments entered into during the current period.  
        
    Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Our primary source of liquidity consisted of approximately $8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016, primarily due to $10.9 million of borrowings under our short-term credit facility, an increase from the $9.0 million received as of March 31, 2016, offset by cash used in our operating activities.   
     
  Net cash used in operating activities was $3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016, resulting primarily from our year-to-date net loss of $5.6 million, offset by non-cash expense adjustments of $2.8 million, which included stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and deferred tax liability.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of capitalized software costs. For the six months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities included costs associated with the acquisition of b-pack SAS in July 2015, as well as the capitalized software costs.  
     
  The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to borrowings under our short-term credit facility during the current period.  

21

We expect to incur significant operating costs for the foreseeable future. We expect to fund our operating costs, as well as our future capital expenditures and liquidity needs, from a combination of available cash balances, internally generated funds and our short-term credit facility. As a result, our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales, changes in deferred revenues, and our ability to manage costs.  
     
  While we have made significant progress in reducing our expenditures, our current cash on hand and future cash flows provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund our working capital and general corporate needs and the non-discretionary capital expenditures without increasing cash flows through our operating activities, raising additional funds through the sale and issuance of additional securities, reducing expenditures, borrowing additional funds under our credit facility or debt arrangements, or a combination of the foregoing. There can be no guarantee that additional equity financing will be available to us at this time or in the future, that any available equity financing will be on terms favorable to the Company and its stockholders or that additional funds will be available under our credit facility.
