and factors include (in no particular order), but are not limited to: 

economic sluggishness and volatility, credit and equity market unpredictability, employment outlook
uncertainties and continued fluctuations in the United States and other world economies that may affect our business and financial
condition, and the business and financial conditions of our advertisers;   

our high degree of leverage and potential inability to finance other strategic transactions given
fluctuations in market conditions;   

fluctuations
                                         in the local economies of the markets in which we operate (particularly our largest markets:
                                         Atlanta; Baltimore; Houston; and Washington, DC) that could negatively impact our ability
                                         to meet our cash needs and our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants;   

fluctuations in the demand for advertising across our various media given fluctuations in the economic
environment;   

risks associated with the implementation and execution of our business diversification strategy;   

increased competition in our markets and in the radio broadcasting and media industries;   

changes in media audience ratings and measurement technologies and methodologies;   

regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) relative to maintaining
our broadcasting licenses, enacting media ownership rules and enforcing of indecency rules;   

changes in our key personnel and on-air talent;   

increases in the costs of our programming, including on-air talent and content acquisition costs;   

financial losses that may be incurred due to impairment charges against our broadcasting licenses,
goodwill, and other intangible assets, particularly in light of the current economic environment;   

increased competition from new media and new content distribution platforms and technologies;   

the impact of our acquisitions, dispositions and similar transactions, as well as consolidation
in industries in which we and our advertisers operate; and   

other factors mentioned in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
including the factors discussed in detail in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  

(a)        Organization    

Radio One, Inc. (a
Delaware corporation referred to as  Radio One ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) is
an urban-oriented, multi-media company that primarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio
broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets African-American and urban listeners.
We currently own and/or operate 56 broadcast stations located in 16 urban markets in the United States.  While our
primary source of revenue is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to
operate as the premier multi-media entertainment and information content provider targeting African-American and urban consumers.
Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments in other complementary media properties. Our
other media interests include our ownership of TV One, LLC ( TV One ), an African-American targeted cable television
network; our ownership of Interactive One, LLC ( Interactive One ), our wholly-owned online platform serving the African-American
community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including Global Grind, News One, TheUrbanDaily
and HelloBeautiful, and online social networking websites, including BlackPlanet and MiGente; and our 80.0% ownership interest
in Reach Media, Inc. ( Reach Media ) which operates the Tom Joyner Morning Show and our other syndicated programming
assets, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show. In May 2014, the Company
agreed to invest a minimum of $5 million up to a maximum of $40 million in MGM s development of a world-class casino property,
MGM National Harbor, located in Prince George s County, Maryland. On April 10, 2015, the Company made its minimum $5 million
investment and accounted for this investment on a cost basis. Upon completion of the project, currently anticipated to be in December
2016, and satisfaction of final licensing requirements, we will make the remainder of this investment, which will further diversify
our platform in the entertainment industry while still focusing on our core demographic. 

As part of our consolidated
financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we
have provided selected financial information on the Company s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) Reach
Media; (iii) internet; and (iv) cable television. (See Note 8    Segment Information .) 

(b)        Interim Financial
Statements    

The
interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In management s opinion, the interim financial
data presented herein include all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. 

Results
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. This Form 10-Q should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K. 

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had
no effect on any other previously reported or consolidated net income or loss or any other statement of operations, balance sheet
or cash flow amounts. Where applicable, these financial statements have been identified as  As Reclassified.  

(c)        Financial Instruments    

Financial
instruments as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, consisted of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable,
long-term debt and redeemable noncontrolling interests. The carrying amounts approximated fair value for each of these financial
instruments as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, except for the Company s outstanding senior subordinated notes,
secured notes and senior secured credit facility. The 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes which are due in February 2020 (the  2020
Notes ) had a carrying value of approximately $315.0 million as of September 30, 2016, and approximately $335.0 million as
of December 31, 2015. The 2020 Notes had a fair value of approximately $293.0 million and $258.0 million as of September 30, 2016,
and December 31, 2015, respectively. The 7.375% Senior Secured Notes that are due in March 2022 (the  2022 Notes )
had a carrying value of approximately $350.0 million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and fair value of approximately
$353.5 million and $311.5 million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. The $350.0 million senior secured
credit facility (the  2015 Credit Facility ) had a carrying value of approximately $345.6 million and $348.3 million
as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, and fair value of approximately $343.9 million and $353.0 million
as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair values of the 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes and the 2015 Credit
Facility, classified as Level 2 instruments, were determined based on the trading values of these instruments in an inactive market
as of the reporting date. The senior unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $11.9 million
(the  Comcast Note ) had a carrying value of approximately $11.9 million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31,
2015. The fair value of the Comcast Note was approximately $11.9 million as of each of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015.
The fair value of the Comcast Note, classified as a Level 3 instrument, was determined based on the fair value of a similar instrument
as of the reporting date using updated interest rate information derived from changes in interest rates since inception to the
reporting date. See Note 5    Long-Term Debt  for further description of our credit facilities and outstanding notes.  

(d)        Revenue Recognition    

Within our radio broadcasting
and Reach Media segments, the Company recognizes revenue for broadcast advertising when a commercial is broadcast, and the revenue
is reported net of agency and outside sales representative commissions, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 605,   Revenue Recognition  .  Agency and outside sales representative commissions
are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing. Generally, clients remit the gross billing amount to the
agency or outside sales representative, and the agency or outside sales representative remits the gross billing, less their commission,
to the Company. For our radio broadcasting segment, agency and outside sales representative commissions were approximately $6.4 million
and $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Agency and outside sales representative
commissions were approximately $19.0 million and $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Interactive One generates
the majority of the Company s internet revenue, and derives such revenue principally from advertising services on non-radio
station branded but Company-owned websites. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements.  Advertising
revenue is recognized either as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered, when  click
through  purchases are made, or ratably over the contract period, where applicable. In addition, Interactive One derives
revenue from its studio operations, in which it provides third-party clients with publishing services including digital platforms
and expertise.  In the case of the studio operations, revenue is recognized primarily through fixed contractual monthly fees
and/or as a share of the third party s reported revenue. 

TV One derives advertising
revenue from the sale of television air time to advertisers and recognizes revenue when the advertisements are run. TV One also
derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various affiliation agreements based on a per subscriber fee multiplied
by the most recent subscriber counts reported by the applicable affiliate. For our cable television segment, agency and outside
sales representative commissions were approximately $3.8 million and $4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Agency and outside sales representative commissions were approximately $11.8 million and $11.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(e)        Launch Support    

TV One has entered
into certain affiliate agreements requiring various payments by TV One for launch support. Launch support assets are used to initiate
carriage under affiliation agreements and are amortized over the term of the respective contracts. Launch support amortization
is recorded as a reduction to revenue. TV One did not incur any launch support fees during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. TV One paid $670,000 of launch support for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The weighted-average amortization period
for launch support is approximately 10.9 years at each of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. The remaining weighted-average
amortization period for launch support is 8.2 years and 8.9 years as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, launch support asset amortization of $20,000 and $61,000, respectively,
was recorded as a reduction to revenue. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, launch support asset amortization
of $594,000 and approximately $2.1 million, respectively, was recorded as a reduction to revenue. 

(f)        Barter Transactions    

For barter transactions,
the Company provides advertising time in exchange for programming content and certain services and accounts for these exchanges
in accordance with ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition  . The Company includes the value of such exchanges in both
broadcasting net revenue and station operating expenses. The valuation of barter time is based upon the fair value of the network
advertising time provided for the programming content and services received. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, barter transaction revenues were $491,000 and $599,000, respectively. Additionally, for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, barter transaction costs were reflected in programming and technical expenses of $450,000 and $552,000, respectively,
and selling, general and administrative expenses of $41,000 and $47,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, barter transaction revenues were approximately $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Additionally, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, barter transaction costs were reflected in programming and technical expenses of
approximately $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, and selling, general and administrative expenses of $122,000 and $142,000,
respectively. 

(g)        Earnings Per Share    

Basic
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock (Classes A, B, C and D) outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.  The
Company s potentially dilutive securities include stock options and unvested restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share
considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a net loss, as the inclusion of the
potentially dilutive common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

The following table
sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (in thousands, except share and per
share data): 

All
stock options and restricted stock awards were excluded from the diluted calculation for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  The
following table summarizes the potential common shares excluded from the diluted calculation. 

(h)        Fair Value Measurements    

We report our financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis under the provisions of
ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.   ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

The
fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs)
used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires
significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 : Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that can be accessed at measurement date. 

Level 2 : Observable inputs other than those
included in Level 1 (i.e., quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities in inactive markets). 

Level 3 : Unobservable inputs reflecting management s
own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 

A financial instrument s level within
the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value instrument. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are categorized as
follows:  

(a)   Pursuant to an employment agreement (the  Employment Agreement ) executed in April
2008, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) is eligible to receive an award (the  Employment Agreement Award )
amount equal to approximately 4% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company s
aggregate pre-Comcast Buyout (as defined below) capital contribution in TV One. The Company reviews the factors underlying this
award at the end of each quarter including the valuation of TV One (based on the estimated enterprise fair value of TV One as determined
by a discounted cash flow analysis) ,  and an assessment of the probability that the Employment Agreement will be renewed
and contain this provision. There are probability factors included in the calculation of the award related to the likelihood that
the award will be realized. The Company s obligation to pay the award was triggered after the Company s recovery of
the aggregate amount of our pre-Comcast Buyout (as defined below) capital contribution in TV One, and payments are required only
upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity event. The CEO was fully vested
in the award upon execution of the Employment Agreement, and the award lapses if the CEO voluntarily leaves the Company or
is terminated for cause. A third-party valuation firm assisted the Company in estimating TV One s fair value using the discounted
cash flow analysis. Significant inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis include forecasted operating results, discount rate
and a terminal value. As noted in our current report on Form 8-K filed October 6, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company approved terms for a new employment agreement with the CEO, including a renewal of the Employment Agreement
Award upon similar terms as in the prior Employment Agreement. While a new employment agreement has not been executed as of the
date of this report, the CEO is being compensated according to the new terms approved by the Compensation Committee.   

(b)   The redeemable noncontrolling
interest in Reach Media is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology. A third-party valuation firm assisted
the Company in estimating the fair value. Significant inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis include forecasted operating
results, discount rate and a terminal value. 

(c)   Balance was measured based on
the estimated enterprise fair value of TV One as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant inputs to the discounted
cash flow analysis include forecasted operating results, discount rate and a terminal value. A third-party valuation firm assisted
the Company in estimating TV One s fair value using the discounted cash flow analysis. 

There were no transfers
in or out of Level 1, 2, or 3 during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. The following table presents the changes
in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

Losses
included in earnings were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as corporate selling, general and administrative
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:  

* Final distribution related
to the incentive award plan occurred during the first quarter of 2016.   

Any significant increases
or decreases in discount rate or long-term growth rate inputs could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. 

Certain assets and
liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820.  These assets
are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances.  Included
in this category are goodwill, radio broadcasting licenses and other intangible assets, net, that are written down to fair value
when they are determined to be impaired, as well as content assets that are periodically written down to net realizable value.
The Company concluded these assets were not impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and, therefore,
were reported at carrying value as opposed to fair value.  

(i)        Impact of Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the codification. The standard
requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB
voted and approved to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not prior to the original effective date of annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard, including
possible transition alternatives, on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net ) 
( ASU 2016-08 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
ASU 2016-08 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact ASU 2016-08 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU
2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance
Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  
( ASU 2016-11 ) and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12 provide additional clarification and
implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11
and ASU 2016-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 aims to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Prior to ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred
charge under GAAP. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied retrospectively,
with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately
$7.4 million of net debt issuance costs presented as a direct reduction to the Company's long-term debt in the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   ( ASU 2015-15 ),
which allows companies to continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset that is amortized ratably over the term
of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
The Company adopted ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016, and capitalized $421,000 of debt issuance costs for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, associated with its new line of credit arrangement. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ),
which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as
noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We early adopted ASU 2015-17
in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retroactive basis and included the current portion of deferred tax liabilities within the noncurrent
portion of deferred tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. However, we did not adjust our prior period consolidated
balance sheet as a result of the adoption of this ASU as the impact was immaterial. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which is a new lease standard
that amends lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize a lease asset and lease liability for leases classified
as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which
relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard provides updated guidance for the accounting for certain
aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding
requirements and the classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for interim and annual reporting
periods after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company
has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  
( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information
about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments and requires consideration of a broader range of
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This standard will be effective for interim and annual
reporting periods after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for
annual periods after December 15, 2018. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A
Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for interim
and annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption
permitted. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

(j)        Redeemable noncontrolling
interest    

Redeemable noncontrolling
interests are interests in subsidiaries that are redeemable outside of the Company s control either for cash or other assets.
These interests are classified as mezzanine equity and measured at the greater of estimated redemption value at the end of each
reporting period or the historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interests adjusted for cumulative earnings allocations.  The
resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are affected by corresponding charges against retained earnings,
or in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. 

(k)        Content Assets    

TV One has
entered into contracts to acquire entertainment programming rights and programs from distributors and producers. The license
periods granted in these contracts generally run from one year to ten years. Contract payments are made in installments over
terms that are generally shorter than the contract period. Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount
equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first airing.
Acquired content is generally amortized on a straight-line method over the term of the license which reflects the estimated
usage. For certain content for which the pattern of usage is accelerated, amortization is based upon the actual usage. 

The Company also has
programming for which the Company has engaged third parties to develop and produce, and it owns most or all rights (commissioned
programming). Content amortization expense for each period is recognized based on the revenue forecast model, which approximates
the proportion that estimated advertising and affiliate revenues for the current period represent in relation to the estimated
remaining total lifetime revenues. 

Acquired program rights
are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. Estimated net realizable values are based on the
estimated revenues associated with the program materials and related expenses. In evaluating its contracts for recoverability for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment and recorded additional amortization expense
of $0 and approximately $1.9 million, respectively. In evaluating its contracts for recoverability for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment and recorded additional amortization expense of $501,000. All produced
and licensed content is classified as a long-term asset, except for the portion of the unamortized content balance that is expected
to be amortized within one year which is classified as a current asset. 

Tax incentives offered
by state and local governments that are directly measured based on production activities are recorded as reductions in production
costs. 

(l)        Derivatives    

The Company recognizes
all derivatives at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability. The accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, depends on the intended use
of the derivative and the resulting designation. 

The Company has accounted
for the Employment Agreement Award as a derivative instrument in accordance with ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging. 
 The Company estimated the fair value of the award at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, to be approximately $25.7 million
and $20.9 million, respectively, and accordingly, adjusted its liability to this amount. The long-term portion is recorded in other
long-term liabilities and the current portion is recorded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The
current portion is calculated based on forecasted cash dividends to be received from TV One. The expense associated with the Employment
Agreement Award was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as corporate selling, general and administrative expenses
and was approximately $1.0 million and $882,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was
approximately $5.8 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 

The Company s obligation
to pay the Employment Agreement Award was triggered after the Company s recovery of the aggregate pre-Comcast Buyout (as
defined below) capital contribution in TV One and payments are only required upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable
securities or proceeds from a liquidity event with respect to the Company s pre-Comcast Buyout capital contribution in TV
One. The CEO was fully vested in the award upon execution of the Employment Agreement, and the award lapses if the CEO voluntarily
leaves the Company, or is terminated for cause. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has approved
terms for a new employment agreement with the CEO, including a renewal of the Employment Agreement Award upon similar terms as
in the prior Employment Agreement. While a new Employment Agreement has not been executed as of the date of this report, the CEO
is being compensated according to the new terms approved by the Compensation Committee. 

(m)        Related Party
Transactions    

Reach Media provides
office facilities (including office space, telecommunications facilities, and office equipment) to the Tom Joyner Foundation, Inc.
(the  Foundation ), a 501(c)(3) entity, and to Tom Joyner, LTD. ( Limited ), Tom Joyner s production
company. Such services are provided to the Foundation and to Limited on a pass-through basis at cost. Under these arrangements,
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts owed to Reach Media were immaterial. 

Reach Media operates
the Tom Joyner Fantastic Voyage, a fund raising event for the Foundation. The terms of the agreement are that Reach Media provides
all necessary operations for the Fantastic Voyage, that the Foundation reimburses the Company for all related expenses, and that
the Foundation pays a fee plus a performance bonus to Reach Media. The fee is up to the first $1.0 million after the Fantastic
Voyage nets $250,000 to the Foundation. The balance of any operating income is earned by the Foundation less a performance bonus
of 50% to Reach Media of any excess over $1.25 million. The Foundation s remittances to Reach Media under the agreement are
limited to its Fantastic Voyage-related cash revenues; Reach Media bears the risk should the Fantastic Voyage sustain a loss
and bears all credit risk associated with the related customer cabin sales. 

The Fantastic Voyage
took place during the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Reach Media s
revenues, expenses, and operating income for the Fantastic Voyage were approximately $8.8 million, $7.8 million, and $1.0 million,
respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately $8.7 million, $7.5 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Foundation owed Reach Media approximately $1.1 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, under the agreement, for operations on the next cruise. 

2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS:  

As
of June 2011, our sole Boston radio station was made the subject of a time brokerage agreement ( TBA ), similar in
operation to a local marketing agreement ( LMA ), whereby, we have made available, for a fee, air time on this station
to another party. On February 3, 2014, the Company executed a new TBA, effective December 1, 2013, for the station.  The TBA
has a three-year term, and, at the conclusion of the TBA, the station will be conveyed to Radio Boston Broadcasting, Inc., an affiliate
of Pacific Media International, LLC. As a result, the station s radio broadcasting license was classified as a short-term
other asset as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and is being amortized through the anticipated conveyance date. 

On
October 20, 2011, we entered into a TBA with WGPR, Inc. ( WGPR ). Pursuant to the TBA, beginning October 24, 2011,
we began to broadcast programs produced, owned or acquired by Radio One on WGPR s Detroit radio station, WGPR-FM. We pay
certain operating costs of WGPR-FM, and in exchange we retain all revenues from the sale of the advertising within the programming
we provide. The original term of the TBA was through December 31, 2014; however, in September 2014, we entered into an amendment
to the TBA to extend the term of the TBA through December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the TBA, WGPR has also granted us certain
rights of first negotiation and first refusal, with respect to the sale of WGPR-FM by WGPR and with respect to any potential time
brokerage agreement for WGPR-FM covering any time period subsequent to the term of the TBA. 

On
April 17, 2015, the Company used the net proceeds from its issuance of its 2022 Notes, along with the 2015 Credit Facility and
Comcast Note, to refinance certain indebtedness and finance the purchase of all the membership interests of an affiliate of Comcast
Corporation ( Comcast ) in TV One (the  Comcast Buyout ). In connection with the Comcast Buyout, the Company
acquired all of Comcast s membership interest in TV One for approximately $221.7 million which consisted of approximately
$211.1 million in cash paid at closing with a subsequent favorable working capital adjustment of approximately $1.3 million and
the issuance of the Comcast Note in the amount of approximately $11.9 million. As of April 17, 2015, the Company owned a 99.6%
interest in TV One. The Comcast Buyout was treated as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810-45-23, as the Company already
had control of TV One. TV One is now wholly-owned, as it has redeemed all management interests that were outstanding. 

On November 12, 2015,
the Company entered into a two-station LMA with Wilks Broadcasting Group for 95.5 FM-WZOH and 107.1 FM-WHOK. While under the LMA,
the stations were a variable interest entity ( VIE ) for which we were not the primary beneficiary based on the fact
that we did not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacted its economic performance.
The Company also entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the stations. This acquisition doubled the size of the previously
two-station urban music cluster in Columbus, Ohio. The Company completed the acquisition of the stations on February 3, 2016,
and as a result of the acquisition, the stations are no longer treated as a VIE. Total consideration paid was approximately $2.0
million. The Company s preliminary purchase accounting to reflect the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
consisted of approximately $1.9 million to radio broadcasting licenses, $957,000 to property and equipment, $84,000 to other intangible
assets, offset by a lease liability of $909,000. The initial purchase price allocation is preliminarily based upon all information
available to the Company at the present time and is subject to change. The Company continues to review the underlying assumptions
and valuation techniques utilized to calculate the fair value of primarily the radio broadcasting licenses, property and equipment,
and lease liability. 

On June 15, 2016, the
Company acquired a translator with the call sign W231BI licensed to Utica, New York (the  Translator ) for $40,000
from Educational Media Foundation.  On July 25, 2016, the Company entered into a sale agreement with Beasley Media Group,
Inc. ( Beasley ) for the sale of the Translator for $400,000.  The Company completed the sale to Beasley on October
21, 2016. 

During the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a letter of intent to sell certain land, towers and equipment to a third party
which the Company expects to close in the next twelve months. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions,
including execution of a definitive agreement.  The identified assets have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated
balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The combined net carrying value of $2.3 million for the assets held for sale is included
in other assets in the Company s consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of the assets
to be disposed of are in excess of their carrying value. 

3.  GOODWILL AND RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES:  

Impairment
Testing  

In
accordance with ASC 350,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,   we do not amortize our indefinite-lived radio broadcasting
licenses and goodwill. Instead, we perform a test for impairment annually across all reporting units, or on an interim basis when
events or changes in circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have occurred in any given reporting unit. Other
intangible assets continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. We perform our annual impairment test
as of October 1 of each year. We evaluate all events and circumstances on an interim basis to determine if a two-step process is
required. The first step of the process involves estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. If the reporting unit s
fair value is less than its carrying value, a second step is performed to attribute the fair value of the reporting unit to the
individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s
goodwill as of the impairment assessment date. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of
the goodwill is written off as a charge to operations. 

Valuation of
Broadcasting Licenses  

During the second
and third quarters of 2016, the total market revenue growth for certain markets in which we operate was below that used in our
2015 annual impairment testing. We deemed that to be an impairment indicator that warranted interim impairment testing of certain
markets  radio broadcasting licenses, which we performed as of June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016. There was no impairment
identified as part of this testing. During the second and third quarters of 2015, the total market revenue growth for certain markets
in which we operate was below that used in our 2014 annual impairment testing. We deemed that to be an impairment indicator that
warranted interim impairment testing of certain markets  radio broadcasting licenses, which we performed as of June 30, 2015,
and September 30, 2015. There was no impairment identified as part of this testing. There were no impairment indicators present
for any of our other radio broadcasting licenses. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating
broadcasting licenses fair values for the interim impairment assessments for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

(a)  Reflects changes only to the key assumptions used in
the interim testing for certain units of accounting. 

Valuation of Goodwill  

During
the third quarter of 2016, we identified an impairment indicator at one of our radio markets, and as such, we performed an interim
analysis for that radio market s goodwill as of September 30, 2016. During the second and third quarters of 2015, we identified
an impairment indicator at one of our radio markets, and as such, we performed an interim analysis for that radio market s goodwill
as of June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. No goodwill impairment was identified during the three or nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating reporting unit fair values
for the  interim impairment assessments for the quarters ended  September  30,
2016 and 2015.   

(a)  Reflects changes only to the key assumptions used in
the interim testing for certain units of accounting. 

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Company performed interim impairment testing on the valuation of goodwill associated with Interactive One. Interactive
One s net revenues and cash flows declined and internal projections were revised downward, which we deemed to be an impairment
indicator. The Company reduced its operating cash flow projections and assumptions based on Interactive One s actual results
which did not meet budget. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating the fair value
for Interactive One for the interim assessment at September 30, 2015. When compared to discount rates for the radio reporting
units, the higher discount rate used to value the reporting unit is reflective of discount rates applicable to internet media
businesses. As a result of our interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $14.5 million
during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. There were no impairment indicators during the three or nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

We did not identify
any impairment indicators for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, at our Reach Media or TV One reportable
segments. 

Goodwill Valuation Results  

The table below presents
the changes in the Company s goodwill carrying values for its four reportable segments: 

4.  INVESTMENTS:  

The company liquidated
its investment portfolio during 2015. Prior to liquidation of the portfolio, investments consisted primarily of corporate fixed
maturity securities and mutual funds. 

Debt securities were
classified as  available-for-sale  and reported at fair value. Investment income was recognized when earned and reported
net of investment expenses. Unrealized gains and losses were excluded from earnings and were reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized, unless the losses were deemed to be other than temporary. Realized
gains or losses, including any provision for other-than-temporary declines in value, were included in the statements of operations.
For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, the specific-identification method of determining cost was used. 

Available-for-sale
securities were sold as follows:   

5.  LONG-TERM DEBT:  

Long-term debt
consists of the following: 

2022 Notes and 2015 Credit Facilities   

On April 17, 2015,
the Company closed its private offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior secured notes due in April
2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes were offered at an original issue price of 100.0% plus accrued interest from
April 17, 2015, and will mature on April 15, 2022. Interest on the 2022 Notes accrues at the rate of 7.375% per annum and is payable
semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, which commenced on October 15, 2015. The 2022 Notes are guaranteed, jointly
and severally, on a senior secured basis by the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries, including TV One, that
guarantee any of its new $350.0 million senior secured credit facility (the  2015 Credit Facility ) entered into concurrently
with the closing of the 2022 Notes. 

The 2015 Credit Facility
matures on December 31, 2018. At the Company s election, the interest rate on borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility is
based on either (i) the then applicable base rate plus 3.5% (as defined in the 2015 Credit Facility) as, for any day, a rate per
annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next 1/100th of 1%) equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate published in the Wall
Street Journal, (b) 1/2 of 1% in excess rate of the overnight Federal Funds Rate at any given time, and (c) the one-month LIBOR
rate commencing on such day plus 1.00%), or (ii) the then applicable LIBOR rate plus 4.5% (as defined in the 2015 Credit Facility).
The average interest rate was approximately 5.14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Quarterly installments of 0.25%,
or $875,000, of the principal balance on the term loan are payable on the last day of each March, June, September and December
beginning on September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $875,000 and approximately
$2.6 million, respectively, under the 2015 Credit Facility. 

In connection with
the closing of the financing transactions, the Company and the guarantor parties thereto entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture
to the indenture governing the 2020 Notes (as defined below). Pursuant to this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, TV One, which previously
did not guarantee the 2020 Notes, became a guarantor under the 2020 Notes indentures. In addition, the closing of the financing
transactions caused a  Triggering Event  (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) and, as a result, the 2020 Notes
became an unsecured obligation of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors and rank equal in right of payment with the Company s
other senior indebtedness.  

The Company used the
net proceeds from the 2022 Notes, along with term loan borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, to refinance its 2011 Credit
Agreement, refinance the TV One Notes (as defined below), finance the buyout of membership interests of Comcast in TV One and to
pay the related accrued interest, premiums, fees and expenses associated therewith. 

The 2015 Credit Facility
contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company is required to comply with, including: 

(a)   maintaining
an interest coverage ratio of no less than: 

(b)   maintaining
a senior leverage ratio of no greater than: 

(c)   limitations
on: 

liens;   

sale of assets;   

payment of dividends; and   

mergers.   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the 2015 Credit Facility. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company had outstanding approximately $345.6 million on its 2015 Credit Facility. The original issue discount is being reflected
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt obligations and amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit
facility. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.4 million
of net debt issuance costs presented as a direct reduction to the Company's long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2015. The amortization of deferred financing costs was charged to interest expense for all periods presented.
The amount of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The amount of deferred financing costs included in interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. 

2011 Credit
Facilities   

On
March 31, 2011, the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility (the  2011 Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate
of banks, and simultaneously borrowed $386.0 million to retire all outstanding obligations under the Company s previous amended
and restated credit agreement and to fund a past obligation with respect to a capital call initiated by TV One.  The
total amount available under the 2011 Credit Agreement was $411.0 million, initially consisting of a $386.0 million term loan facility
that matured on March 31, 2016, and a $25.0 million revolving loan facility that matured on March 31, 2015. Borrowings under the
2011 Credit Agreement were subject to compliance with certain covenants including, but not limited to, certain financial covenants.
Proceeds from the 2011 Credit Agreement could be used for working capital, capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of
business, a common stock repurchase program, permitted direct and indirect investments and other lawful corporate purposes. On
December 19, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2011 Credit Agreement (the  December 2012 Amendment ).
The December 2012 Amendment: (i) modified financial covenant levels with respect to the Company's total-leverage, secured-leverage,
and interest-coverage ratios; (ii) increased the amount of cash the Company can net for determination of its net indebtedness
tests; and (iii) extended the time for certain of the 2011 Credit Agreement's call premium while reducing the time for its later
and lower premium. 

On
January 21, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2011 Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment )
with its lenders.  The provisions of the 2011 Credit Agreement relating to the call premium were revised by the Second Amendment
to extend the call protection from April 1, 2015, until maturity.  The Second Amendment provided a call premium of 101.5%
if the 2011 Credit Agreement were refinanced with proceeds from a notes offering and 100.5% if the 2011 Credit Agreement was refinanced
with proceeds from any other repayment, including proceeds from a new term loan. The call premium was payable at the
earlier of any refinancing or final maturity. 

The
2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, contained affirmative and negative covenants with which the Company was required to comply,
including financial covenants. In accordance with the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, the calculations for the ratios did not
include the operating results or related debt of TV One, but rather included our proportionate share of cash dividends received
from TV One for periods presented. 

Under
the terms of the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, interest on base rate loans was payable quarterly and interest on LIBOR loans
was payable monthly or quarterly. The base rate was equal to the greater of: (i) the prime rate; (ii) the Federal Funds Effective
Rate plus 0.50%; or (iii) the one-month LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%.  The applicable margin on the 2011 Credit Agreement was between
(i) 4.50% and 5.50% on the revolving portion of the facility and (ii) 5.00% (with a base rate floor of 2.5% per annum) and 6.00%
(with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% per annum) on the term portion of the facility. The average interest rate was 7.50% for the first quarter
of 2015 prior to the refinancing. Quarterly installments of 0.25%, or $957,000, of the principal balance on the term loan were
payable on the last day of each March, June, September and December. 

On
February 24, 2015, the Company entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had letters of credit totaling $933,000 under the agreement for certain operating leases and certain insurance policies.
Letters of credit issued under the agreement are required to be collateralized with cash. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repaid approximately $368.5 million under the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended.
The original issue discount was being reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt obligations and amortized
to interest expense over the term of the credit facility. According to the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company
did not make an excess cash flow payment in April 2015. 

As
noted above, the Company used the net proceeds from the private offering of the 2022 Notes, along with term loan borrowings under
the 2015 Credit Facility, to refinance its 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt
of approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This amount included a write-off of approximately $1.3 million
of previously capitalized debt financing costs, a write-off of $844,000 of original issue discount associated with the 2011 Credit
Agreement, as amended, as well as $827,000 associated with the call premium to refinance the credit facility, $106,000 associated
with the consent to the existing holders of the 2020 Notes and approximately $4.0 million of costs associated with the financing
transactions. 

Senior Subordinated
Notes   

On
February 10, 2014, the Company closed a private placement offering of $335.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25%
senior subordinated notes due 2020 (the  2020 Notes ). The 2020 Notes were offered at an original issue price of
100.0% plus accrued interest from February 10, 2014. The 2020 Notes mature on February 15, 2020. Interest accrues at the rate
of 9.25% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 in the amount of approximately $15.5
million, which commenced on August 15, 2014. Subsequent to the repurchase of a portion of the 2020 Notes (as described
below), the semiannual interest payment is approximately $14.6 million. The 2020 Notes are guaranteed by certain of the
Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and any other subsidiaries that guarantee the existing senior
credit facility or any of the Company s other syndicated bank indebtedness or capital markets securities. The Company
used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase or otherwise redeem all of the amounts then outstanding under its
12.5%/15% Senior Subordinated Notes due May 2016 and to pay the related accrued interest, premiums, fees and expenses
associated therewith. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately $20 million of its 2020
Notes at an average price of approximately 86% of par. The Company recorded a gain on retirement of debt of
approximately $2.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company
had $315.0 million and $335.0 million, respectively, of 2020 Notes outstanding. 

The
indenture that governs the 2020 Notes contains covenants that restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company to incur
additional debt, purchase common stock, make capital expenditures, make investments or other restricted payments, swap or sell
assets, engage in transactions with related parties, secure non-senior debt with assets, or merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially
all of its assets. 

TV One Senior Secured Notes   

TV
One issued $119.0 million in senior secured notes on February 25, 2011 ( TV One Notes ). The proceeds from the notes
were used to purchase equity interests from certain financial investors and TV One management. The notes accrued interest at 10.0%
per annum, which was payable monthly, and the entire principal amount was due on March 15, 2016. In connection with the closing
of the financing transactions on April 17, 2015, the TV One Notes were repaid. 

Comcast Note   

The
Company also has outstanding a senior unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $11.9 million
due to Comcast ( Comcast Note ). The Comcast Note bears interest at 10.47%, is payable quarterly in arrears, and the
entire principal amount is due on April 17, 2019. 

Asset-Backed Credit Facility   

On April 21, 2016,
the Company entered into a senior credit agreement governing an asset-backed credit facility (the  ABL Facility ) among
the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Wells Fargo Bank National Association, as administrative agent (the
 Administrative Agent ). The ABL Facility provides for $25 million in revolving loan borrowings in order to provide
for the working capital needs and general corporate requirements of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not
have any borrowings outstanding on its ABL Facility. 

At the Company s
election, the interest rate on borrowings under the ABL Facility are based on either (i) the then applicable margin relative to
Base Rate Loans (as defined in the ABL Facility) or (ii) the then applicable margin relative to LIBOR Loans (as defined in the
ABL Facility) corresponding to the average availability of the Company for the most recently completed fiscal quarter. 

Advances under the
ABL Facility are limited to (a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the amount of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the ABL Facility),
less the amount, if any, of the Dilution Reserve (as defined in the ABL Facility), minus (b) the sum of (i) the Bank Product Reserve
(as defined in the ABL Facility), plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all other reserves, if any, established by Administrative Agent. 

All obligations under
the ABL Facility are secured by first priority lien on all (i) deposit accounts (related to accounts receivable), (ii) accounts
receivable, (iii) all other property which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the ABL Facility).  The obligations
are also secured by all material subsidiaries of the Company. 

The ABL Facility matures
on the earlier to occur of: (a) the date that is five (5) years from the effective date of the ABL Facility and
(b) the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the  Term Loan Maturity Date  of the Company s
existing term loan, and (ii) the  Stated Maturity  of the Company s existing notes.  As of the effective date
of the ABL Facility, the  Term Loan Maturity Date  is December 31, 2018, and the  Stated Maturity  is April
15, 2022. 

Finally, the ABL Facility
is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the ABL Facility) by and among the Administrative Agent,
the administrative agent for the secured parties under the Company s term loan and the trustee and collateral trustee under
the senior secured notes indenture. 

The
Company conducts a portion of its business through its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company s subsidiaries have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the Company s 2022 Notes, 2020 Notes and the Company s obligations under the 2015 Credit
Facility. 

The
2022 Notes are the Company s senior secured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company s
and the guarantors  existing and future senior indebtedness, including obligations under the 2015 Credit Facility and the
Company s 2020 Notes.  The 2022 Notes and related guarantees are equally and ratably secured by the same collateral
securing the 2015 Credit Facility and any other parity lien debt issued after the issue date of the 2022 Notes, including any additional
notes issued under the Indenture, but are effectively subordinated to the Company s and the guarantors  secured indebtedness
to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness that does not also secure the 2022 Notes. Collateral includes
substantially all of the Company s and the guarantors  current and future property and assets for accounts receivable,
cash, deposit accounts, other bank accounts, securities accounts, inventory and related assets including the capital stock of each
subsidiary guarantor. Finally, the Company also has the Comcast Note which is a general but senior unsecured obligation of the
Company. 

Future
scheduled minimum principal payments of debt as of September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

6.  INCOME TAXES:  

The Company recorded
tax expense of approximately $8.3 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of approximately $12.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, based on the actual effective tax rate for the current period. Because our income tax expense
does not have a correlation to our pre-tax earnings, small changes in those earnings can have a significant impact on the income
tax expense we recognize.  The Company continues to estimate a range of possible outcomes due to the proportion of deferred
tax expense from indefinite-lived intangible assets over pre-tax earnings. As a result, we believe the actual effective tax rate
best represents the estimated effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with ASC 740-270,   Interim
Reporting .  

As of September 30,
2016, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets for substantially all entities and
jurisdictions, but excludes deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 740,
  Accounting for Income Taxes  , the Company continually assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance by assessing
the likely future tax consequences of events that have been realized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns,
tax planning strategies, and future profitability. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not believe it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. As part of the assessment, the Company has not included the deferred
tax liability related to indefinite-lived intangible assets as a source of future taxable income to support realization of the
deferred tax assets. 

7.  STOCKHOLDERS 
EQUITY:   

Stock Repurchase
Program   

In December 2015,
the Company s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of shares of the Company s Class A and Class D common stock
(the  December 2015 Repurchase Authorization ). Under the December 2015 Repurchase Authorization, the Company is authorized,
but is not obligated, to repurchase up to $3.5 million worth of its Class A and/or Class D common stock. On March 25, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors reaffirmed the December 2015 Repurchase Authorization without any limitation on price, and
on September 23, 2016 increased the authorization to $7.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $7.0
million remaining under the authorization with respect to its Class A and Class D common stock. Repurchases may be made from time
to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The timing
and extent of any repurchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the Company s Class A
and/or Class D common stock and other factors, and subject to restrictions under applicable law. The Company executes upon the
stock repurchase program in a manner consistent with market conditions and the interests of the stockholders, including maximizing
stockholder value. In addition, the Company has limited but ongoing authority to purchase shares of Class D common stock (in one
or more transactions at any time there remain outstanding grants) under the Company s 2009 Stock Plan (as defined below)
to satisfy any employee or other recipient tax obligations in connection with the exercise of an option or a share grant under
the 2009 Stock Plan, to the extent that the Company has capacity under its financing agreements (i.e., its current credit facilities
and indentures) (each a  Stock Vest Tax Repurchase ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
executed a Stock Vest Tax Repurchase of 330,111 shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of $568,000 at an average price of
$1.72 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company executed a Stock Vest Tax Repurchase of 345,293
shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of approximately $1.4 million at an average price of $4.12 per share. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any Class A common stock and repurchased 619,418 shares
of Class D common stock in the amount of approximately $1.9 million at an average price of $3.01 per share. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any Class A common stock and repurchased 1,255,592 shares of Class D
common stock in the amount of approximately $3.0 million at an average price of $2.40 per share. During the three months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company did not repurchase any Class A Common Stock or Class D Common Stock. 

Stock Option and Restricted Stock
Grant Plan   

A stock option and
restricted stock plan ( the 2009 Stock Plan ) was approved by the stockholders at the Company s annual meeting
on December 16, 2009.  The Company had the authority to issue up to 8,250,000 shares of Class D Common Stock under
the 2009 Stock Plan.  On September 26, 2013, the Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved on November 14,
2013, certain amendments to and restatement of the 2009 Stock Plan (the  Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Plan ). The
amendments under the Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Plan primarily affected (i) the number of shares with respect to which options
and restricted stock grants may be granted under the 2009 Stock Plan and (ii) the maximum number of shares that can be awarded
to any individual in any one calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Plan increased the authorized plan shares remaining
available for grant to 7,000,000 shares of Class D common stock after giving effect to the issuances prior to the amendment. Prior
to the amendment, under the 2009 Plan, in any one calendar year, the compensation committee could not grant to any one participant
options to purchase, or grants of, a number of shares of Class D common stock in excess of 1,000,000.  Under the Amended
and Restated 2009 Stock Plan, this limitation was eliminated. The purpose of eliminating this limitation is to provide
the compensation committee with maximum flexibility in setting executive compensation. On April 13, 2015, the Board of Directors
adopted, and our stockholders approved on June 2, 2015, a further amendment to the Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Plan. This further
amendment increased the authorized plan shares remaining available for grant to 8,250,000 shares of Class D common stock. As of
September 30, 2016, 8,012,932 shares of Class D common stock were available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2009 Stock
Plan. 

On September 30, 2014,

as of December 31, 2013, and subject to the Company s insider trading policy, a portion of each recipient s vested
shares may be sold in the open market for tax purposes on or about the vesting dates. 

On October 26, 2015,
the Compensation Committee awarded David Kantor, Chief Executive Officer, Radio Division, 100,000 restricted shares of the Company s

and other information relating to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are summarized below: 

The aggregate intrinsic
value in the table above represents the difference between the Company s stock closing price on the last day of trading during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares that would have been received
by the holders of in-the-money options had all the option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2016. This amount changes
based on the fair market value of the Company s stock. There were no options exercised during the three and nine months ended

Item 2.   Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The
following information should be read in conjunction with  Selected Financial Data  and the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements and Management s Discussion
and Analysis contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Introduction  

Revenue   

Within our core radio
business, we primarily derive revenue from the sale of advertising time and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers
on our radio stations. Advertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge,
as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market. These rates are largely based upon a radio station s
audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, the number of radio stations in the related market, and the
supply of, and demand for, radio advertising time. Advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting
hours. 

Net revenue consists
of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions. Agency and outside sales representative
commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing. 

The following chart
shows the percentage of consolidated net revenue generated by each reporting segment. 

The following chart
shows net revenue generated from our core radio business as a percentage of consolidated net revenue. The downward trend is consistent
with our strategic diversification strategy. In addition, it shows the percentages generated from local and national advertising
as a subset of net revenue from our core radio business. 

National advertising
also includes advertising revenue generated from our internet segment. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment was generated
from tower rental income, ticket sales and revenue related to our sponsored events, management fees and other revenue. 

The following charts
show our net revenue (and sources) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

In the broadcasting
industry, radio stations and television stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging
advertising time for goods or services. In order to maximize cash revenue for our spot inventory, we closely monitor the use of
trade and barter agreements. 

Interactive
One derives its revenue from advertising services. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising
revenue is recognized either as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages)  are delivered, when
 click through  purchases are made or leads are generated, or ratably over the contract period, where applicable.
In addition, Interactive One derives revenue from its studio operations, in which it provides third-party clients with publishing
services including digital platforms and related expertise.  In the case of the studio operations, revenue is recognized
primarily through fixed contractual monthly fees and/or as a share of the third party s reported revenue. 

TV
One generates the Company s cable television revenue, and derives its revenue principally from advertising and affiliate
revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of television air time to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements
are run. TV One also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various affiliation agreements based upon a per subscriber
fee multiplied by most recent subscriber counts reported by the applicable affiliate.  

Reach Media primarily
derives its revenue from the sale of advertising inventory in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Tom Joyner
Morning Show and our other syndicated programming assets, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, the Russ Parr Morning Show
and the DL Hughley Show. Reach Media also operates www.BlackAmericaWeb.com, an African-American targeted news and entertainment
website.  Additionally, Reach Media operates various other event-related activities. 

Expenses   

Our
significant expenses are: (i) employee salaries and commissions; (ii) programming expenses; (iii) marketing and
promotional expenses; (iv) rental of premises for office facilities and studios; (v) rental of transmission tower space;
(vi) music license royalty fees; and (vii) content amortization. We strive to control these expenses by centralizing
certain functions such as finance, accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems and, in certain markets,
the programming management function. We also use our multiple stations, market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable
rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies. In addition to salaries and commissions, major expenses
for our internet business include membership traffic acquisition costs, software product design, post-application software development
and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with internet service
provider ( ISP ) hosting services and other internet content delivery expenses. Major expenses for our cable
television business include content acquisition and amortization, sales and marketing. 

We
generally incur marketing and promotional expenses to increase and maintain our audiences. However, because Nielsen reports ratings
either monthly or quarterly, depending on the particular market, any changed ratings and the effect on advertising revenue tends
to lag behind both the reporting of the ratings and the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures.  

Measurement of Performance   

We
monitor and evaluate the growth and operational performance of our business using net income and the following key metrics: 

(a)  Net
revenue :  The performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily
measured by its ability to generate net revenue. Net revenue consists of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside
sales representative commissions consistent with industry practice. Net revenue is recognized in the period in which advertisements
are broadcast. Net revenue also includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services, which is recorded at fair value,
revenue from sponsored events and other revenue. Net revenue is recognized for our online business as impressions are delivered,
as  click throughs  are made or ratably over contract periods, where applicable. Net revenue is recognized for our
cable television business as advertisements are run, and during the term of the affiliation agreements at levels appropriate for
the most recent subscriber counts reported by the affiliate, net of launch support. 

(b)  Broadcast
and internet operating income  (formerly station operating income):  Net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization,
income taxes, interest expense, interest income, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, other (income) expense, corporate
selling, general and administrative, expenses, stock-based compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and loss on retirement
of debt, is commonly referred to in our industry as station operating income. However, given the diverse nature of our business,
station operating income is not truly reflective of our multi-media operation and therefore we now use the term broadcast and
internet operating income. Broadcast and internet operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). Nevertheless, broadcast and internet operating income is a significant
measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments. Broadcast and internet operating
income provides helpful information about our results of operations, apart from expenses associated with our fixed and long-lived
intangible assets, income taxes, investments, impairment charges, debt financings and retirements, corporate overhead and stock-based
compensation. Our measure of broadcast and internet operating income is similar to our historic use of station operating income,
however, reflects our more diverse business and, therefore, may not be similar to  station operating income  or other
similarly titled measures used by other companies. Broadcast and internet operating income does not represent operating loss or
cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to
those measurements as an indicator of our performance. 

(c)  Broadcast
and internet operating income margin :  Broadcast and internet operating income margin represents broadcast and internet
operating income as a percentage of net revenue. Broadcast and internet operating income margin is not a measure of financial performance
under GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that broadcast and internet operating income margin is a useful measure of our performance
because it provides helpful information about our profitability as a percentage of our net revenue. Broadcast and internet operating
margin includes results from all four segments (radio broadcasting, Reach Media, internet and cable television). 

(d)
 Adjusted EBITDA : Adjusted EBITDA consists of net (loss) income plus (1) depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest
expense, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, (gain)
loss on retirement of debt, employment agreement and incentive plan award expenses, severance-related costs, less (2) other income
and interest income. Net income before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization is commonly
referred to in our business as  EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under
GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant measure
used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our business because Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation,
amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our acquisitions and debt financing, our taxes, impairment charges, and
gain on retirements of debt. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about the operating performance
of our business, apart from the expenses associated with our fixed assets and long-lived intangible assets, capital structure or
the results of our affiliated company. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used as one of the measures for comparing businesses in our
industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including,
but not limited to the fact that our definition includes the results of all four of our operating segments (radio broadcasting,
Reach Media, internet and cable television). Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do not purport to represent operating income or cash flow
from operating activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered
as alternatives to those measurements as an indicator of our performance. 

Summary of Performance   

The tables below provide a summary of
our performance based on the metrics described above:  

The reconciliation of net (loss) income

RADIO ONE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table summarizes our historical
consolidated results of operations: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015  ( In thousands)  

Net revenue   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized approximately $110.9 million in net revenue compared
to approximately $115.9 million during the same period in 2015. These amounts are net of agency and outside sales
representative commissions. Net revenues from our radio broadcasting segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
decreased 6.2% from the same period in 2015. Based on reports prepared by the independent accounting firm Miller, Kaplan,
Arase   Co., LLP ( Miller Kaplan ), the markets we operate in (excluding Richmond and Raleigh, both of which
no longer participate in Miller Kaplan) decreased 3.0% in total revenues. We experienced net revenue growth most
significantly in our Charlotte, Richmond and Washington D.C. markets; however, this growth was offset by declines in other
markets (with Columbus, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Houston experiencing the most significant declines). Reach Media s
net revenues decreased 7.1% in the third quarter 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to lower advertising
and events revenue. We recognized approximately $46.8 million of revenue from our cable television segment during the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $47.6 million for the same period in 2015, with the decrease
primarily resulting from lower advertising sales. Finally, net revenues for our internet business decreased 2.3% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to decreases in alliance and
indirect revenues.  

Operating Expenses   

Programming and technical, excluding stock-based
compensation  

Programming and technical
expenses include expenses associated with on-air talent and the management and maintenance of the systems, tower facilities, and
studios used in the creation, distribution and broadcast of programming content on our radio stations. Programming and technical
expenses for the radio segment also include expenses associated with our programming research activities and music royalties.
For our internet segment, programming and technical expenses include software product design, post-application software development
and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with ISP hosting services
and other internet content delivery expenses. For our cable television segment, programming and technical expenses include expenses
associated with technical, programming, production, and content management. The decreased expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to lower music licensing costs in our radio broadcasting segment.
The decrease in expense at our radio broadcasting segment was partially offset by an increase at our cable television segment. 

Selling, general and administrative,
excluding stock-based compensation  

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with our sales departments, offices and facilities and personnel
(outside of our corporate headquarters), marketing and promotional expenses, special events and sponsorships and back office expenses.
Expenses to secure ratings data for our radio stations and visitors  data for our websites are also included in selling,
general and administrative expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the radio broadcasting segment
and internet segment include expenses related to the advertising traffic (scheduling and insertion) functions. Selling, general
and administrative expenses also include membership traffic acquisition costs for our online business. The decreased expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by our cable television and
radio broadcasting segments. The cable television segment incurred higher marketing and promotional expenses in the prior period
related to advertising and promoting a new original program, as well as higher employee compensation costs in the prior period.
Our radio broadcasting segment s lower expenses were driven by various cost cutting measures, including eliminating unprofitable
events and lower contractual costs. 

Corporate selling, general and administrative,
excluding stock-based compensation  

Corporate expenses
consist of expenses associated with our corporate headquarters and facilities, including personnel as well as other corporate
overhead functions. The net decrease in corporate expenses was due primarily to lower compensation costs. 

Stock-based compensation  

The decrease in stock-based
compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to the vesting
and cancellation of stock awards for certain executive officers and other management personnel. 

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and
amortization expense increased to approximately $8.5 million compared to approximately $8.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Impairment of long-lived assets  

During the quarter
ended September 30, 2015, the Company identified a triggering event to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis on the Interactive
One reporting unit. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to Interactive One of approximately $14.5 million
during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

Interest expense   

Interest expense
decreased to approximately $20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $20.4 million
for the same period in 2015. 

Provision for income taxes    

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the provision for income taxes was approximately $4.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively,
primarily related to the deferred tax liability ( DTL ) for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The change in taxes
was primarily due to the completion of tax amortization from previously acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets and provision
to return adjustments to the state effective rate. 

Noncontrolling interests in income
of subsidiaries   

The decrease in noncontrolling
interests in income of subsidiaries was due to lower net income generated by Reach Media. 

Other Data   

Broadcast and internet operating income  

Broadcast and internet operating
income increased to approximately $43.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately
$41.7 million for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of $1.2 million or 2.9%. Our cable television segment generated
approximately $20.5 million of broadcast and internet operating income during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $18.7 million
during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily attributable to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, due
to lower marketing and promotional expenses and lower compensation costs. 

Broadcast and internet operating income margin  

Broadcast and internet operating
income margin increased to 38.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from 36.0% for the comparable period in 2015.
The margin increase was primarily attributable to our cable television segment s higher broadcast and internet operating margin of 43.8%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 39.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due
to lower selling, general and administrative expenses as noted above. 

RADIO ONE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table summarizes our historical
consolidated results of operations: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015 (In thousands)  

Net revenue   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we recognized approximately $342.7 million in net revenue compared to approximately $341.5 million during
the same period in 2015. These amounts are net of agency and outside sales representative commissions. Net revenues from our radio
broadcasting segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased 2.3% from the same period in 2015. Based on reports
prepared by Miller Kaplan, the markets we operate in decreased 0.7% in total revenues. We experienced net revenue growth in certain
markets (most significantly in our Charlotte, Cleveland and Washington, DC markets); however, this growth was offset by declines
in other markets (with our Columbus, Detroit, Houston, and Philadelphia markets experiencing the most significant net revenue
declines). Reach Media s net revenues decreased 0.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same
period in 2015. We recognized approximately $143.9 million and $138.9 million of revenue from our cable television segment during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, due primarily to an increase in rates for certain affiliates.
Net revenue for our internet business decreased 0.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period
in 2015. 

Operating Expenses   

Programming and technical, excluding
stock-based compensation  

Programming and technical
expenses include expenses associated with on-air talent and the management and maintenance of the systems, tower facilities, and
studios used in the creation, distribution and broadcast of programming content on our radio stations. Programming and technical
expenses for the radio segment also include expenses associated with our programming research activities and music royalties.
For our internet segment, programming and technical expenses include software product design, post-application software development
and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with ISP hosting services
and other internet content delivery expenses. For our cable television segment, programming and technical expenses include expenses
associated with technical, programming, production, and content management. The decreased expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to lower music licensing costs in our radio broadcasting segment. 

Selling,
general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation  

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with our sales departments, offices and facilities and personnel
(outside of our corporate headquarters), marketing and promotional expenses, special events and sponsorships and back office expenses.
Expenses to secure ratings data for our radio stations and visitors  data for our websites are also included in selling,
general and administrative expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the radio broadcasting segment
and internet segment include expenses related to the advertising traffic (scheduling and insertion) functions. Selling, general
and administrative expenses also include membership traffic acquisition costs for our online business. The decrease in selling,
general and administrative expenses is primarily driven by our radio broadcasting segment. Our radio broadcasting segment s
lower expenses were driven by various cost cutting measures, including eliminating unprofitable events and lower contractual costs. 

Corporate selling, general and administrative,
excluding stock-based compensation  

Corporate
expenses consist of expenses associated with our corporate headquarters and facilities, including personnel as well as other corporate
overhead functions. There was an increase in corporate expenses due to an increase in compensation expense for the Chief Executive
Officer in connection with the valuation of the potential payment for the Employment Agreement Award element in his employment
agreement. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our cable television segment due to a decrease in the allowance
for doubtful accounts. 

Stock-based compensation  

The decrease in stock-based
compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to the vesting
and cancellation of stock awards for certain executive officers and other management personnel. 

Depreciation and amortization  

The decrease in depreciation
and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due to the completion of useful lives for certain assets
and the completion of amortization for certain intangible assets. 

Impairment of long-lived assets  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company identified a triggering event to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis on the Interactive
One reporting unit. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to Interactive One of approximately $14.5 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Interest expense   

Interest expense
increased to approximately $61.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $59.6 million
for the same period in 2015. The primary driver of the increase in interest expense was higher debt balances, partially offset
by lower interest rates. 

Gain (loss)
on retirement of debt   

The
gain on retirement of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due to the redemption of approximately $20 million
of our 2020 Notes at a discount. The loss on retirement of debt of approximately $7.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, was due to the retirement of the 2011 Credit Agreement and payoff of the TV One Notes during the second quarter. This
amount included a write-off of approximately $1.3 million of previously capitalized debt financing costs, a write-off of $844,000
of original issue discount associated with the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, as well as $827,000 associated with the call
premium to refinance the credit facility, $106,000 associated with the consent to the existing holders of the 2020 Notes and approximately
$4.0 million of costs associated with the financing transactions. 

Provision for income taxes   

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the provision for income taxes was approximately $8.3 million and $22.9 million, respectively,
primarily related to the DTL for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily
due to the completion of tax amortization from previously acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets.  

Noncontrolling
interests in income of subsidiaries    

The decrease in noncontrolling
interests in income of subsidiaries was due primarily to our increased ownership percentage of TV One, as TV One is now wholly-owned. 

Other Data   

Broadcast and internet operating income  

Broadcast and internet operating
income increased to approximately $131.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $124.4
million for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of $7.1 million or 5.7%. This increase was due to higher broadcast and internet operating
income, primarily at our radio broadcasting and cable television segments. TV One generated approximately $65.6 million of broadcast and internet operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $61.1 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2015, with the increase due primarily to increased affiliate revenues. The radio broadcasting segment generated approximately
$57.0 million of broadcast and internet operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $52.4 million during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, with the increase primarily attributable to lower selling, general and administrative expenses
due to the elimination of unprofitable events and lower contractual costs. 

Broadcast and internet operating income margin  

Broadcast and internet operating
income margin increased to 38.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 36.4% for the comparable period in
2015. The margin increase was primarily attributable to greater operating income as noted above. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Our
primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and, to the extent necessary, borrowings available under our senior
credit facility and other debt or equity financing. 

2022 Notes and 2015 Credit Facilities   

On April 17, 2015,
the Company closed its private offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior secured notes due in April
2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes were offered at an original issue price of 100.0% plus accrued interest from
April 17, 2015, and will mature on April 15, 2022. Interest on the 2022 Notes accrues at the rate of 7.375% per annum and is payable
semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, which commenced on October 15, 2015. The 2022 Notes are guaranteed, jointly
and severally, on a senior secured basis by the Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries, including TV One, that
guarantee any of its new $350.0 million senior secured credit facility (the  2015 Credit Facility ) entered into concurrently
with the closing of the 2022 Notes. 

The 2015 Credit Facility
matures on December 31, 2018. At the Company s election, the interest rate on borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility
is based on either (i) the then applicable base rate plus 3.5% (as defined in the 2015 Credit Facility) as, for any day, a rate
per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next 1/100th of 1%) equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate published in the
Wall Street Journal, (b) 1/2 of 1% in excess rate of the overnight Federal Funds Rate at any given time, and (c) the one-month
LIBOR rate commencing on such day plus 1.00%), or (ii) the then applicable LIBOR rate plus 4.5% (as defined in the 2015 Credit
Facility). The average interest rate was approximately 5.14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Quarterly installments
of 0.25%, or $875,000, of the principal balance on the term loan are payable on the last day of each March, June, September and
December beginning on September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $875,000
and approximately $2.6 million, respectively, under the 2015 Credit Facility. 

In connection with
the closing of the financing transactions, the Company and the guarantor parties thereto entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture
to the indenture governing the 2020 Notes (as defined below). Pursuant to this Fourth Supplemental Indenture, TV One, which previously
did not guarantee the 2020 Notes, became a guarantor under the 2020 Notes indentures. In addition, the closing of the financing
transactions caused a  Triggering Event  (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture) and, as a result, the 2020 Notes
became an unsecured obligation of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors and rank equal in right of payment with the Company s
other senior indebtedness.  

The Company used
the net proceeds from the 2022 Notes, along with term loan borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility, to refinance its 2011 Credit
Agreement, refinance the TV One Notes (as defined below), finance the buyout of membership interests of Comcast in TV One and
to pay the related accrued interest, premiums, fees and expenses associated therewith. 

The 2015 Credit Facility
contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company is required to comply with, including: 

(a)  maintaining an interest coverage ratio
                                         of no less than: 

(b)  maintaining a senior leverage ratio of
                                         no greater than: 

(c)  limitations on: 

liens;   

sale of assets;   

payment of dividends; and   

mergers.   

As of September 30,
2016, ratios calculated in accordance with the 2015 Credit Facility were as follows:

As

As of September 30,
2016, the Company had outstanding approximately $345.6 million on its 2015 Credit Facility. The original issue discount is being reflected
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt obligations and amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit
facility. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.4 million
of net debt issuance costs presented as a direct reduction to the Company's long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2015. The amortization of deferred financing costs was charged to interest expense for all periods presented.
The amount of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The amount of deferred financing costs included in interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $3.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. 

2011 Credit
Facilities   

On
March 31, 2011, the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility (the  2011 Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate
of banks, and simultaneously borrowed $386.0 million to retire all outstanding obligations under the Company s previous
amended and restated credit agreement and to fund a past obligation with respect to a capital call initiated by TV One.  The
total amount available under the 2011 Credit Agreement was $411.0 million, initially consisting of a $386.0 million term loan
facility that matured on March 31, 2016, and a $25.0 million revolving loan facility that matured on March 31, 2015. Borrowings
under the 2011 Credit Agreement were subject to compliance with certain covenants including, but not limited to, certain financial
covenants. Proceeds from the 2011 Credit Agreement could be used for working capital, capital expenditures made in the ordinary
course of business, a common stock repurchase program, permitted direct and indirect investments and other lawful corporate purposes.
On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2011 Credit Agreement (the  December 2012 Amendment ).
The December 2012 Amendment: (i) modified financial covenant levels with respect to the Company's total-leverage, secured-leverage,
and interest-coverage ratios; (ii) increased the amount of cash the Company can net for determination of its net indebtedness
tests; and (iii) extended the time for certain of the 2011 Credit Agreement's call premium while reducing the time for its later
and lower premium. 

On
January 21, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to the 2011 Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment )
with its lenders.  The provisions of the 2011 Credit Agreement relating to the call premium were revised by the Second Amendment
to extend the call protection from April 1, 2015, until maturity.  The Second Amendment provided a call premium of 101.5%
if the 2011 Credit Agreement were refinanced with proceeds from a notes offering and 100.5% if the 2011 Credit Agreement was refinanced
with proceeds from any other repayment, including proceeds from a new term loan. The call premium was payable at the
earlier of any refinancing or final maturity. 

The
2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, contained affirmative and negative covenants with which the Company was required to comply,
including financial covenants. In accordance with the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, the calculations for the ratios did not
include the operating results or related debt of TV One, but rather included our proportionate share of cash dividends received
from TV One for periods presented. 

Under
the terms of the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended, interest on base rate loans was payable quarterly and interest on LIBOR loans
was payable monthly or quarterly. The base rate was equal to the greater of: (i) the prime rate; (ii) the Federal Funds Effective
Rate plus 0.50%; or (iii) the one-month LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%.  The applicable margin on the 2011 Credit Agreement was between
(i) 4.50% and 5.50% on the revolving portion of the facility and (ii) 5.00% (with a base rate floor of 2.5% per annum) and 6.00%
(with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% per annum) on the term portion of the facility. The average interest rate was 7.50% for the first
quarter of 2015 prior to the refinancing. Quarterly installments of 0.25%, or $957,000, of the principal balance on the term loan
were payable on the last day of each March, June, September and December. 

On
February 24, 2015, the Company entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had letters of credit totaling $933,000 under the agreement for certain operating leases and certain insurance policies.
Letters of credit issued under the agreement are required to be collateralized with cash. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repaid approximately $368.5 million under the 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended.
The original issue discount was being reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt obligations and
amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit facility. According to the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended,
the Company did not make an excess cash flow payment in April 2015. 

As
noted above, the Company used the net proceeds from the private offering of the 2022 Notes, along with term loan borrowings under
the 2015 Credit Facility, to refinance its 2011 Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt
of approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This amount included a write-off of approximately $1.3 million
of previously capitalized debt financing costs, a write-off of $844,000 of original issue discount associated with the 2011 Credit
Agreement, as amended, as well as $827,000 associated with the call premium to refinance the credit facility, $106,000 associated
with the consent to the existing holders of the 2020 Notes and approximately $4.0 million of costs associated with the financing
transactions. 

Senior
Subordinated Notes   

On
February 10, 2014, the Company closed a private placement offering of $335.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25%
senior subordinated notes due 2020 (the  2020 Notes ). The 2020 Notes were offered at an original issue price of
100.0% plus accrued interest from February 10, 2014. The 2020 Notes mature on February 15, 2020. Interest accrues at the rate
of 9.25% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 in the amount of approximately $15.5
million, which commenced on August 15, 2014. Subsequent to the repurchase of a portion of the 2020 Notes (as described
below), the semiannual interest payment is approximately $14.6 million. The 2020 Notes are guaranteed by certain of the
Company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and any other subsidiaries that guarantee the existing senior
credit facility or any of the Company s other syndicated bank indebtedness or capital markets securities. The Company
used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase or otherwise redeem all of the amounts then outstanding under its
12.5%/15% Senior Subordinated Notes due May 2016 and to pay the related accrued interest, premiums, fees and expenses
associated therewith. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately $20 million of its 2020
Notes at an average price of approximately 86% of par. The Company recorded a gain on retirement of debt of approximately
$2.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had $315.0
million and $335.0 million, respectively, of 2020 Notes outstanding. 

The
indenture that governs the 2020 Notes contains covenants that restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company to incur
additional debt, purchase common stock, make capital expenditures, make investments or other restricted payments, swap or sell
assets, engage in transactions with related parties, secure non-senior debt with assets, or merge, consolidate or sell all or
substantially all of its assets. 

TV One Senior Secured Notes   

TV
One issued $119.0 million in senior secured notes on February 25, 2011 ( TV One Notes ). The proceeds from the notes
were used to purchase equity interests from certain financial investors and TV One management. The notes accrued interest at 10.0%
per annum, which was payable monthly, and the entire principal amount was due on March 15, 2016. In connection with the closing
of the financing transactions on April 17, 2015, the TV One Notes were repaid. 

Comcast Note   

The
Company also has outstanding a senior unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $11.9 million
due to Comcast ( Comcast Note ). The Comcast Note bears interest at 10.47%, is payable quarterly in arrears, and the
entire principal amount is due on April 17, 2019. 

Asset-Backed Credit Facility   

On April 21, 2016,
the Company entered into a senior credit agreement governing an asset-backed credit facility (the  ABL Facility )
among the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Wells Fargo Bank National Association, as administrative agent
(the  Administrative Agent ). The ABL Facility provides for $25 million in revolving loan borrowings in order to provide
for the working capital needs and general corporate requirements of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not
have any borrowings outstanding on its ABL Facility. 

At the Company s
election, the interest rate on borrowings under the ABL Facility are based on either (i) the then applicable margin relative to
Base Rate Loans (as defined in the ABL Facility) or (ii) the then applicable margin relative to LIBOR Loans (as defined in the
ABL Facility) corresponding to the average availability of the Company for the most recently completed fiscal quarter. 

Advances under the
ABL Facility are limited to (a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the amount of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the ABL Facility),
less the amount, if any, of the Dilution Reserve (as defined in the ABL Facility), minus (b) the sum of (i) the Bank Product Reserve
(as defined in the ABL Facility), plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all other reserves, if any, established by Administrative
Agent. 

All obligations under
the ABL Facility are secured by first priority lien on all (i) deposit accounts (related to accounts receivable), (ii) accounts
receivable, (iii) all other property which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the ABL Facility).  The obligations
are also secured by all material subsidiaries of the Company. 

The ABL Facility
matures on the earlier to occur of: (a) the date that is five (5) years from the effective date of the ABL Facility
and (b) the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the  Term Loan Maturity Date  of the
Company s existing term loan, and (ii) the  Stated Maturity  of the Company s existing notes.  As of
the effective date of the ABL Facility, the  Term Loan Maturity Date  is December 31, 2018, and the  Stated Maturity 
is April 15, 2022. 

Finally, the ABL
Facility is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the ABL Facility) by and among the Administrative
Agent, the administrative agent for the secured parties under the Company s term loan and the trustee and collateral trustee
under the senior secured notes indenture. 

The
Company conducts a portion of its business through its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company s subsidiaries have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the Company s 2022 Notes, 2020 Notes and the Company s obligations under the 2015 Credit
Facility. 

The
2022 Notes are the Company s senior secured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company s
and the guarantors  existing and future senior indebtedness, including obligations under the 2015 Credit Facility and the
Company s 2020 Notes.  The 2022 Notes and related guarantees are equally and ratably secured by the same collateral
securing the 2015 Credit Facility and any other parity lien debt issued after the issue date of the 2022 Notes, including any
additional notes issued under the Indenture, but are effectively subordinated to the Company s and the guarantors 
secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness that does not also secure the 2022
Notes. Collateral includes substantially all of the Company s and the guarantors  current and future property and
assets for accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts, other bank accounts, securities accounts, inventory and related assets
including the capital stock of each subsidiary guarantor. Finally, the Company also has the Comcast Note which is a general but
senior unsecured obligation of the Company. 

The
following table summarizes the interest rates in effect with respect to our debt as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)    Subject to variable LIBOR
plus a spread that is incorporated into the applicable interest rate set forth above.  

The
following table provides a comparison of our statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net
cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately $34.6 million and $30.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased
from the prior period primarily due to improved collections on accounts receivable, partially offset by payments on accounts payable
and accrued compensation costs. 

Net cash flows used in investing activities were approximately $6.0 million and $217.9 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditures, including digital tower and transmitter
upgrades, and deposits for station equipment and purchases were approximately $4.0 million and $6.0 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Proceeds from sales of investment securities were approximately $3.5
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and purchases of investment securities were $591,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid approximately $209.9 million to purchase
the additional membership interest in TV One and paid approximately $5.0 million for the cost method investment in MGM. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid approximately $2.0 million to complete the acquisition of our new Columbus
stations. 

Net cash flows used
in financing activities were approximately $23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and net cash flows provided
by financing activities were approximately $179.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company repaid approximately $2.6 million and $369.4 million, respectively, in outstanding
debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately $17.2 million of our 2020 Notes. In
addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repaid approximately $119.0 million in TV One senior secured
notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we borrowed approximately $350.0 million in 7.375% Senior Secured Notes
due 2022 and approximately $350.0 million in new 2015 Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, we capitalized $421,000 and approximately $23.5 million of costs associated with our indebtedness. The amounts capitalized
in 2016 relate to costs associated with our new line of credit arrangement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, we repurchased approximately $3.6 million and $1.4 million of our Class D Common Stock. TV One paid approximately
$5.7 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Reach Media paid
approximately $1.0 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid a net premium of $827,000 associated with the call premium to refinance
the credit facility. 

Credit Rating Agencies   

Our corporate credit
ratings by Standard   Poor's Rating Services and Moody's Investors Service are speculative-grade and have been downgraded
and upgraded at various times during the last several years. Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing
costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase our cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business
operations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

Our
significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 -  Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We prepare our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. In Management s Discussion and Analysis contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, we summarized the policies and estimates that we believe to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in
preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows. There have been no material changes to our existing accounting policies or estimates since we filed our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

Goodwill and Radio Broadcasting Licenses   

Impairment Testing  

We
have made several acquisitions in the past for which a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and
radio broadcasting licenses. Goodwill exists whenever the purchase price exceeds the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible
net assets acquired in business combinations. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $645.1 million in broadcast licenses
and $ 258.3  million in goodwill, which totaled $903.4 million, and represented approximately
66.4% of our total assets. Therefore, we believe estimating the fair value of goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses is a critical
accounting estimate because of the significance of their carrying values in relation to our total assets. We did not record any
impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

We test for impairment
annually across all reporting units, or when events or changes in circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have
occurred in any given reporting unit. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of October 1 of each year. Impairment exists
when the carrying value of these assets exceeds its respective fair value. When the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment
amount is charged to operations for the excess. 

Valuation
of Broadcasting Licenses  

During the second
and third quarters of 2016, the total market revenue growth for certain markets in which we operate was below that used in our
2015 annual impairment testing. We deemed that to be an impairment indicator that warranted interim impairment testing of certain
markets  radio broadcasting licenses, which we performed as of June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016. There was no impairment
identified as part of this testing. During the second and third quarters of 2015, the total market revenue growth for certain
markets in which we operate was below that used in our 2014 annual impairment testing. We deemed that to be an impairment indicator
that warranted interim impairment testing of certain markets  radio broadcasting licenses, which we performed as of June
30, 2015, and September 30, 2015. There was no impairment identified as part of this testing. There were no impairment indicators
present for any of our other radio broadcasting licenses. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model
for estimating broadcasting licenses fair values for the interim impairment assessments for the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. 

(a)  Reflects changes only to the key assumptions used in
the interim testing for certain units of accounting. 

Valuation of Goodwill  

During
the third quarter of 2016, we identified an impairment indicator at one of our radio markets, and as such, we performed an interim
analysis for that radio market s goodwill as of September 30, 2016. During the second and third quarters of 2015, we identified
an impairment indicator at one of our radio markets, and as such, we performed an interim analysis for that radio market s goodwill
as of June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. No goodwill impairment was identified during the three or nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating reporting unit fair
values for the interim impairment assessments for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(a)    Reflects changes only to
the key assumptions used in the interim testing for certain units of accounting.  

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Company performed interim impairment testing on the valuation of goodwill associated with Interactive One. Interactive
One s net revenues and cash flows declined and internal projections were revised downward, which we deemed to be an impairment
indicator. The Company reduced its operating cash flow projections and assumptions based on Interactive One s actual results
which did not meet budget. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating the fair value
for Interactive One for the interim assessment at September 30, 2015. When compared to discount rates for the radio reporting
units, the higher discount rate used to value the reporting unit is reflective of discount rates applicable to internet media
businesses. As a result of our interim assessment, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $14.5 million
during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. There were no impairment indicators during the three or nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

We did not identify
any impairment indicators for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, at our Reach Media or TV One reportable
segments. 

As part of our annual
testing, when arriving at the estimated fair values for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill, we also performed an analysis
by comparing our overall average implied multiple based on our cash flow projections and fair values to recently completed sales
transactions, and by comparing our fair value estimates to the market capitalization of the Company. The results of these comparisons
confirmed that the fair value estimates resulting from our annual assessment for 2015 were reasonable. 

Several
of the licenses in our units of accounting have limited or no excess of fair values over their respective carrying values. Should
our estimates, assumptions, or events or circumstances for any upcoming valuations worsen in the units with no or limited fair
value cushion, additional license impairments may be needed in the future. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the codification. The standard
requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB
voted and approved to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not prior to the original effective date of annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard, including
possible transition alternatives, on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net ) 
( ASU 2016-08 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
ASU 2016-08 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact ASU 2016-08 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU
2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance
Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  
( ASU 2016-11 ) and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12 provide additional clarification and
implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11
and ASU 2016-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 aims to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Prior to ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred
charge under GAAP. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied retrospectively,
with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately
$7.4 million of net debt issuance costs presented as a direct reduction to the Company's long-term debt in the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   ( ASU 2015-15 ),
which allows companies to continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset that is amortized ratably over the term
of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
The Company adopted ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016, and capitalized $421,000 of debt issuance costs for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, associated with its new line of credit arrangement. 

In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ),
which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as
noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We early adopted ASU 2015-17
in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retroactive basis and included the current portion of deferred tax liabilities within the noncurrent
portion of deferred tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. However, we did not adjust our prior period consolidated
balance sheet as a result of the adoption of this ASU as the impact was immaterial. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which is a new lease standard
that amends lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize a lease asset and lease liability for leases classified
as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the
new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which
relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard provides updated guidance for the accounting for certain
aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding
requirements and the classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for interim and annual reporting
periods after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company
has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful
information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments and requires consideration of a broader
range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This standard will be effective for interim and
annual reporting periods after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted
for annual periods after December 15, 2018. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A
Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for interim
and annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption
permitted. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

CAPITAL AND COMMERICAL COMMITMENTS:  

Radio Broadcasting Licenses   

Each of the Company s
radio stations operates pursuant to one or more licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission that have a maximum term
of eight years prior to renewal. The Company s radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times beginning October 1,
2019 through August 1, 2022. Although the Company may apply to renew its radio broadcasting licenses, third parties may challenge
the Company s renewal applications. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would prevent the Company
from having its current licenses renewed. 

Indebtedness   

We
have several debt instruments outstanding within our corporate structure. We incurred senior bank debt as part of our 2015 Credit
Facility in the amount of $350.0 million that matures on December 31, 2018. We also have $315.0 million outstanding in our 2020
Notes and we also have $350.0 million outstanding in our 2022 Notes. Finally, we also have outstanding our senior unsecured promissory
note in the agreement principal amount of approximately $11.9 million under the Comcast Note. See   Liquidity and Capital
Resources.   

Royalty Agreements   

The Company has historically
entered into fixed and variable fee music license agreements with performance rights organizations including the Society of European
Stage Authors and Composers ( SESAC ), American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP )
and Broadcast Music, Inc. ( BMI ).  Our ASCAP and BMI licenses expire December 31, 2016. The Company has authorized
the Radio Music License Committee (the  RMLC ) to negotiate on its behalf with respect to its licenses with SESAC,
ASCAP and BMI including the ASCAP and BMI licenses expiring December 31, 2016. The RMLC is currently in negotiations with ASCAP and
BMI for license terms of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021.  The RMLC is in preparation for a binding rate arbitration
with SESAC.  This arbitration will be completed by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2017 and the rate decision will
have retroactive application to January 1, 2016.  In the interim, we continue payments to SESAC at the existing 2015 rates
and, SESAC may not increase our fees for any reason prior to the rate arbitration decision being issued. In connection with all
performance rights organization agreements, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $1.0 million and $2.7 million for the
three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $6.1 million and $7.7 million for the nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Lease obligations   

We
have non-cancelable operating leases for office space, studio space, broadcast towers and transmitter facilities that expire over
the next 15 years. 

Operating Contracts and Agreements   

We
have other operating contracts and agreements including employment contracts, on-air talent contracts, severance obligations,
retention bonuses, consulting agreements, equipment rental agreements, programming related agreements, and other general operating
agreements that expire over the next nine years. 

Reach Media Noncontrolling Interest Shareholders 
Put Rights   

Beginning on January
1, 2018, the noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media have an annual right to require Reach Media to purchase all or
a portion of their shares at the then current fair market value for such shares (the  Put Right ).  Beginning
in 2018, this annual right is exercisable for a 30-day period beginning January 1 of each year. The purchase price for such shares
may be paid in cash and/or registered Class D common stock of Radio One, at the discretion of Radio One. 

Contractual Obligations Schedule   

The following table represents our contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)    Includes interest obligations
based on current effective interest rate on senior subordinated notes and secured notes outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

(2)    Includes interest obligations
based on effective interest rate and projected interest expense on credit facilities outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

(3)    Includes employment contracts
(including the Employment Agreement Award), severance obligations, on-air talent contracts, consulting agreements, equipment rental
agreements, programming related agreements, and other general operating agreements. Also includes contracts that TV One has entered
into to acquire entertainment programming rights and programs from distributors and producers. These contracts relate to their
content assets as well as prepaid programming related agreements.  

Of the total amount
of other operating contracts and agreements included in the table above, approximately $148.1 million has not been recorded on
the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, as it does not meet recognition criteria. Approximately $18.7 million relates to certain
commitments for content agreements for our cable television segment, approximately $21.1 million relates to employment agreements,
and the remainder relates to other programming, network and operating agreements. 

Other Contingencies   

The
Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. It is management s
opinion, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

On February 24, 2015,
the Company entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had letters
of credit totaling $933,000 under the agreement for certain operating leases and certain insurance policies. Letters of credit
issued under the agreement are required to be collateralized with cash. 

Item 3:   Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

For
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting Radio One, see Item 7A:   Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
 Our exposure related to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2015. 

Item 4.   Controls
and Procedures   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures  

We
have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )
and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to
be included in our periodic SEC reports. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act, are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching our desired disclosure
controls objectives. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in reaching that level of reasonable assurance. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings   

Legal Proceedings  

Radio One is involved
from time to time in various routine legal and administrative proceedings and threatened legal and administrative proceedings
incidental to the ordinary course of our business. Radio One believes the resolution of such matters will not have a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors   

In addition to the
other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I,   Item
1A. Risk Factors   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ),

as updated by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and/or operating results.

Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

None. 

Item 3.   Defaults
Upon Senior Securities
