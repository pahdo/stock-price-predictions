   1.                             ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES  
     
  Pacific Vegas Global Strategies, Inc. (the  Company ), formerly known as Goaltimer International, Inc., was incorporated in Colorado on December 19, 1990.  
     
  Upon the expiry of an International Gaming License granted by the government of the Commonwealth of Dominica on December 6, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to cease the then business due to significant losses incurred.  
     
  The Company has been in an inactive or non-operating status since December 6, 2004, and remain as a shell company with its only activity of incurring non-operating expenses.  
     
   2.                             PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements as of  September 30, 2016 have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods and include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented. Information as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the USA ( USGAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201 5. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 
     
  The condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are presented in United States dollars and prepared in conformity with USGAAP which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Table of Contents   
     
  The Company had a negative working capital and a stockholders  deficit of US$ 564,251 as of September 30, 2016. The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with USGAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, a substantial doubt has been raised with regard to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern as the Company had total liabilities in excess of its total assets. In light of the situation, the Company has been contemplating practical plans for a business restructuring and/or possible arrangements to raise additional capital funds to support its continuation as a going concern, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in procuring of such efforts. The Company has maintained no revenue-generating or cash in-flow operations since December 6, 2004 and has relied on cash injections from the principal stockholder of the Company, who has undertaken to finance the Company for a  reasonable  period of time for the Company to continue as a going concern, assuming that in such a period of time the Company would be able to restructure its business and restart on a revenue-generating operation and/or raise additional capital funds to support its continuation. However, the principal stockholder retains her right to discontinue such financing at her own discretion. It is uncertain as for how long or to what extent such a period of time would be  reasonable  in the discretion of the principal stockholder, and there can be no assurance that the financing from the principal stockholder will not be discontinued at any time. 
     
  Other than the private financing by cash in-flow from the principal stockholder, which is unsecured and could be discontinued at any time, the Company has currently preserved no sources of liquidity to support its continuation as a going concern.  
     
  These uncertainties may result in adverse effects on continuation of the Company as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include or reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  
     
   3.                             RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
     
  As of the date that this quarterly report is filed, there are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements which adoption would have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  
     
   4.                             INCOME TAXES  
     
  Subject to the provision of ASC Topic 740, the  Company has analyzed its filing position in the jurisdictions where it is subject to income tax. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has identified United States in which it is subject to income tax. Based on the evaluations noted above, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial statements. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits or accruals for the potential payment of interest and penalties. The Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities.

   5.                             LOSS PER SHARE  
     
  Basic loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during each period.  
     
  The Company had no potential common stock instruments with a dilutive effect for any period presented and therefore basic and diluted loss per share are the same.  
     
   6.                             DUE TO A STOCKHOLDER  
     
  The amount due is unsecured, interest-free and repayable on demand.  
     
   7.                             COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
     
  As of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no material outstanding commitments and contingencies.

   8.                             FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
     
  ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels are defined as follows:  

Level 1:       
 
  Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted market prices in active   markets for the identical asset or liabilities.           

Level 2:       
 
  Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly   or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term   of the financial instrument.           

Level 3:       
 
  Unobservable inputs reflecting the entity s own assumptions in   measuring the asset or liability at fair value.              
     
  The Company s financial instruments consist of deposits and prepayments and accrued expenses which are carried at amounts that generally approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  
     
  It  is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the amount due to a stockholder due to its related party nature.

   ITEM 2.                             MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
     
  Our presentation in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current projections or expectations with regard to the future operations of business. Such projections or expectations are expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that such projections or expectations will prove to be correct or accurate, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results of operations may differ materially.  
     
   1                                Revenue and Expenses  
     
  The Company has remained in an inactive and non-operating status since December 6, 2004. There was no active business operated and no revenue earned by the Company for the three months and  nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
     
  Total expenses for the three months and  nine months ended September 30, 2016 were US$9,720 and US$29,108 against US$10,023 and US$28,934 for the same period last year. Expenses represent professional fees and miscellaneous administrative expenses in these periods. 
     
   2                                Net Loss  
     
  Net  loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were US$9,720 and US$29,108 against a net loss of US$10,023 and US$28,934 for the same period last year. 
     
   3                                Cashflows, Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     
  As of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of cash and cash equivalents for the Company was nil. The Company has currently retained no sources of liquidity other than the private financing by cash inflow from the principal stockholder, which is unsecured and could be discontinued at any time.

   4                                Plan of Operation  
     
  The Company has been in non-operating status and remains as a shell company since December 6, 2004. The Company has planned for a reorganization to acquire sufficient capital funds and engage in a selected business. However, there can be no assurance as to when or whether the Company will be able to accomplish this plan.  
     
   5.                             Going Concern  
     
  The Company has relied on the private financing by cash inflow from the principal stockholder of the Company, who has undertaken to finance the Company in cash for a  reasonable  period of time for the Company to continue as a going concern, assuming that in such a period of time the Company would be able to restructure its business and restart on a revenue-generating operation and/or raise additional capital funds to support its continuation. However, it is uncertain as for how long or to what extent such a period of time would be  reasonable , and there can be no assurance that the financing from the principal stockholder will not be discontinued.  
     
  These uncertainties may result in adverse effects on continuation of the Company as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include or reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  
     
   ITEM 3.                             QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
  The Company  is not exposed to currencies fluctuation or exchange risk as it has been in an inactive and non-operating status since December 6, 2004. The Company has remained as a shell company with its only activity that of incurring non-operating expenses.
