1.    Basis of Presentation 
    
  Nature of Business 
    
  Natural Resource Partners L.P. (the "Partnership") engages principally in the business of owning, operating, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates and other natural resources. As used in these Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements, the terms "NRP," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Natural Resource Partners L.P. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Reporting 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Partnership have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.  
    
  As described in    Note 2. Discontinued Operations   , the Partnership has classified the assets and liabilities, operating results and cash flows of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. 
    
  As described in    Note 3. Segment Information   , the Partnership has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the way it internally manages and monitors segment performance. In particular, prior year general and administrative charges that were allocated to operating segments have been reclassified to Operating and maintenance expenses and Operating and maintenance expenses affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The prior period reclassifications for new segments had no impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial position, net income (loss) or cash flows.   
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Partnership adopted a new accounting standard using a retrospective approach that required the presentation of the Partnership's debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than recorded as an asset. The adoption resulted in a reclassification that reduced other current assets and short-term debt by   $0.2 million   and reduced other assets and long-term debt (including affiliate) by   $13.8 million   on the Partnership s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.  
    
  On January 26, 2016, the board of directors of the Partnership's general partner approved a 1-for-10 reverse split on its common units, effective following market close on February 17, 2016. Pursuant to the authorization provided, the Partnership completed the 1-for-10 reverse unit split and its common units began trading on a reverse unit split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange on February 18, 2016. As a result of the reverse unit split, every 10 outstanding common units were combined into one common unit. The reverse unit split reduced the number of common units outstanding from   122.3 million   units to   12.2 million   units. All unit and per unit data included in these consolidated financial statements has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse unit split. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership determined its net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used by financing activities were understated by   $8.0 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   has been corrected for this error.  
    
  In the Partnership's opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.

Management s Forecast, Strategic Plan and Going Concern Analysis 
       
  While NRP has a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable operations with positive operating cash flows, its operating results and credit metrics have been impacted by challenges in coal and other commodity markets. The following going concern analysis includes an evaluation of relevant conditions and events, including the Partnership's business performance and forecast, and its ability to meet its obligations and remain in compliance with its debt covenants over the next twelve months. 
    
  As described in    Note 8. Debt and Debt Affiliate   , NRP Operating LLC ("Opco"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, has debt agreements that contain customary financial covenants, including maintenance covenants, and other covenants. In addition, the Partnership has issued   $425 million   of   9.125%   Senior Notes due October 2018 (the "NRP Senior Notes") that are governed by an indenture (the "Indenture") containing customary incurrence-based financial covenants and other covenants, but not maintenance covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , Opco had   $260.0 million   of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility (the "Opco Credit Facility") with scheduled commitment reductions of   $50.0 million   on December 31, 2016,   $30.0 million   on June 30, 2017,   $30.0 million   on December 31, 2017, with the remaining balance of   $150 million   maturing on June 30, 2018. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   Opco had   $529.9 million   outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes with scheduled principal payments of   $80.8 million   through September 30, 2017 (the "Opco Private Placement Notes") (collectively referred to as the "Opco Debt agreements"). The maximum leverage ratio under the Opco Debt agreements is required not to exceed   4.0  x. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations. Opco's leverage ratio was   2.95  x at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Partnership currently forecasts that it will meet its obligations, including scheduled principal and interest payments, that it will remain in compliance with its debt covenants, and that it will continue as a going concern. However, the forecast is sensitive to commodity demand, pricing and counterparty credit and operating risk. In addition, the scheduled debt principal payments in 2017 under Opco's Debt agreements will strain the Partnership's liquidity. Inability to make these payments would result in an event of default and could result in Opco s lenders accelerating Opco s debt. Breaches of the Opco debt covenants that are not waived or cured would have a similar effect. Any such acceleration by the Opco lenders would result in a cross-default under the NRP Indenture.   
    
  The Partnership has been and is currently pursuing or considering a number of actions in order to manage its liquidity and mitigate the effects of adverse market developments that could affect its ability to repay debt and remain in compliance with the covenants under its debt agreements. On a cumulative basis since January 1, 2015, the Partnership has reduced debt by   $262.2 million   and completed asset sales for   $192 million   in gross sales proceeds. In addition, the Partnership is continuing to take proactive steps with a long-term view to address its 2018 debt maturities and has engaged Greenhill   Co., LLC to advise in connection with these efforts. The Partnership is currently in active discussions with several institutional investors that may provide new equity capital to it. In addition, the Partnership has begun discussions with representatives of several holders of the NRP Senior Notes, and it may determine to pursue a refinancing or an exchange of some or all those notes.   
    
  As the Partnership pursues these capital markets transactions, it will continue to manage its business with a focus on debt reduction, cost management, and maximizing opportunities within its current asset base, including additional asset sales. The coal markets have shown improvement during the third quarter of 2016, particularly with respect to metallurgical coal, and the Partnership expects its coal royalty business to benefit from the higher pricing environment. However, to the extent that the Partnership is unable to execute on opportunistic capital raising and/or debt refinancing efforts on favorable terms and the coal markets do not show a sustained improvement, the Partnership s liquidity may be adversely affected. Accordingly, the Partnership may consider other alternatives over the next several months to manage its liquidity and address its debt maturities.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended its guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of this amendment is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance will also require enhanced disclosures, provide more comprehensive guidance for transactions such as service revenue and contract modifications, and enhance guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The Partnership is required to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Partnership is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and has not determined the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure or decided upon the method of adoption. 
    
  The FASB issued guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new guidance will require a formal assessment of going concern by management based on criteria prescribed in the new guidance, but will not impact the Partnership's financial position or results of operations. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Partnership is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure and reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with this new guidance upon adoption. 
    
  The FASB issued authoritative guidance which intended to simplify the measurement of inventory. This guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The FASB issued authoritative lease guidance that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the present value of the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The guidance also requires disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 31, 2018. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The FASB issued authoritative guidance that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current standard with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 31, 2019. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The FASB issued authoritative guidance to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows in order to reduce current and potential future diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December 31, 2017. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

2.    Discontinued Operations 
    
  In June 2016, the Partnership determined it met held for sale criteria for its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets. In June 2016, NRP Oil and Gas signed a definitive agreement to sell these assets for   $116.1 million  , subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas closed this transaction, which had an effective date of April 1, 2016.  
    
  The Partnership's exit from its non-operated oil and gas working interest business represents a strategic shift to reduce debt and focus on its aggregates, soda ash and coal royalty and other business segments. As a result, the Partnership has classified the operating results and cash flows of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.

Prior to this exit, the Partnership's non-operated oil and gas working interest assets were included along with its oil and gas royalty assets as a separate reportable segment.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership transitioned management responsibilities and reporting of its oil and gas royalty assets into its Coal Royalty and Other operating segment and eliminated its Oil and Gas segment.  See    Note 3. Segment Information    for further segment information.

The following table (in thousands) presents supplemental cash flow information of the Partnership's discontinued operations: 

Capital expenditures related to the Partnership's discontinued operations were   $3.1 million   and   $36.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  

3.    Segment Information 
    
  The Partnership's segments are strategic business units that offer products and services to different customer segments in different geographies within the U.S. and that are managed accordingly. NRP has the following   three   operating segments:  
    
  Coal Royalty and Other   consists primarily of coal royalty and coal related transportation and processing assets.  Other assets include aggregate royalty, industrial mineral royalty, oil and gas royalty and timber. The Partnership's coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Its aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States. As a result of the sale of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets and exit from this oil and gas business in the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership transitioned management responsibilities and reporting of its oil and gas royalty assets into the Coal Royalty and Other operating segment. The Partnership has adjusted the corresponding items of segment information for prior periods to reflect this change.  In February 2016, the Partnership sold reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee.  In February 2016, the Partnership also sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several oil and gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin.  
    
  Soda Ash   consists of the Partnership's   49%   non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, the Partnership's operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. The Partnership receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.   
    
  VantaCore   consists of the Partnership's construction materials business that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. VantaCore   operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana.    
    
  Direct segment costs and certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit the Partnership's segments are allocated to the operating segments. These allocated costs include costs of: taxes, legal, information technology and shared facilities services and are included in Operating and maintenance expenses and Operating and maintenance expenses affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Prior year general and administrative charges of   $4.8 million   and   $15.1 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were allocated to the operating segments and have been reclassified to operating and maintenance expenses. Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market. 
    
  Corporate and Financing includes functional corporate departments that do not earn revenues. Costs incurred by these departments include corporate headquarters and overhead,  financing, centralized treasury and accounting and other corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment.

  Sales of Royalty Properties 
    
  As discussed in    Note 1. "Basis of Presentation,"    the Partnership is currently pursuing or considering a number of actions, including dispositions of assets, in order to mitigate the effects of adverse market developments which could otherwise cause the Partnership to breach financial covenants under its debt agreements. As part of this plan, the Partnership executed a definitive agreement to sell all its mineral fee interests in Grant County, Oklahoma. As a result, approximately   $5.5 million   in the Partnership's oil and gas royalty mineral rights are classified as Current assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016. In addition, the Partnership completed the sale of the following assets during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 
  1)  Oil and gas royalty and overriding royalty interests in several producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin for   $36.4 million  . The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2016, and the Partnership recorded an   $18.6 million   gain from this sale included in Gain on asset sales, net on its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
  2)  Hard mineral reserves and related royalty rights at   three   aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee for   $10.0 million  . The effective date of the sale was February 1, 2016, and the Partnership recorded a   $1.5 million   gain from this sale included in Gain on asset sales, net on its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
  In addition to the two asset sales described above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold mineral reserves in multiple sale transactions for cumulative   $9.8 million   of gross sales proceeds and recorded   $6.8 million   of cumulative gain from these sale transactions that are included in Gain on asset sales, net on its Consolidated Statement of

Comprehensive Income. The substantial majority of these amounts relate to eminent domain transactions with governmental agencies. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership sold mineral reserves for   $3.7 million   in gross sales proceeds and recorded a   $3.3 million   gain on asset sales included in Gain on asset sales, net on its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
    
  Impairment of Mineral Rights 
    
  The Partnership has developed procedures to periodically evaluate its long-lived assets for possible impairment. These procedures are performed throughout the year and consider both quantitative and qualitative information based on historic, current and future performance and are designed to identify impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator is identified, additional evaluation is performed for that asset that considers both quantitative and qualitative information. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the future expected undiscounted cash flows from its use and disposition are less than the assets  carrying value. Impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value, which is primarily determined based upon the present value of the projected future cash flow compared to the assets  carrying value. The inputs used by management for fair value measurements include significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 fair value measurement for these types of assets. In addition to the evaluations discussed above, specific events such as a reduction in economically recoverable reserves or production ceasing on a property for an extended period may require that a separate impairment evaluation be completed on a significant property. The Partnership believes the discount rates used in estimating fair value were representative of what market participants would use in valuing the impacted assets.  
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership identified facts and circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of certain of its mineral rights exceed future cash flows from those assets and recorded non-cash impairment expense as follows (in thousands):  

(1) 
    The Partnership recorded   $3.8 million   and   $3.9 million   of coal property impairments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Total coal property impairment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $249.4 million  . The Partnership recorded   $1.5 million   of coal property impairment during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and the fair value measurement of these impaired assets recorded at fair value was   $0.0 million   at June 30, 2015. The Partnership recorded the remaining   $247.8 million   of coal property impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fair value measurement of these impaired assets recorded at fair value was   $28.4 million   at September 30, 2015. These impairments primarily resulted from the continued deterioration and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, sustained low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. NRP compared net capitalized costs of its coal properties to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If the net capitalized cost exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows, the Partnership recorded an impairment for the excess of net capitalized cost over fair value. Significant inputs used to determine fair value include estimates of future cash flow, discount rate and useful economic life. Estimated cash flows are the product of a process that began with current realized pricing as of the measurement date and included an adjustment for risk related to the future realization of cash flows.

    The Partnership recorded   $70.5 million   of oil and gas royalty property impairment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fair value measurement of these impaired assets recorded at fair value were   $13.0 million   at September 30, 2015. This impairment primarily resulted from declines in future expected realized commodity prices and reduced expected drilling activity on its acreage. NRP compared net capitalized costs of its oil and gas royalty properties to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If the net capitalized cost exceeded the undiscounted future net cash flows, the Partnership recorded an impairment for the excess of net capitalized cost over fair value. A discounted cash flow method was used to estimate fair value. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include estimates of: (i) oil and gas reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves; (ii) future commodity prices; (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production and (vi) discount rates. The underlying commodity prices embedded in the Partnership's estimated cash flows are the product of a process that begins with NYMEX forward curve pricing as of the measurement date, adjusted for estimated location and quality differentials. 
              (3) 
    The Partnership recorded   $1.4 million   and   $1.7 million   of aggregates royalty property impairments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Partnership recorded   $43.4 million   of aggregates royalty property impairments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fair value measurement of these impaired assets recorded at fair value was   $13.1 million   at September 30, 2015. This impairment primarily resulted from greenfield development projects that have not performed as projected, leading to recent lease concessions on minimums and royalties combined with the continued regional market decline for certain properties. NRP compared net capitalized costs of its aggregates properties to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. If the net capitalized cost exceeded the undiscounted cash flows, the Partnership recorded an impairment for the excess of net capitalized cost over fair value. A discounted cash flow model was used to estimate fair value. Significant inputs used to determine fair value include estimates of future cash flow, discount rate and useful economic life. Estimated cash flows are the product of a process that began with current realized pricing as of the measurement date and included an adjustment for risk related to the future realization of cash flows.  

7.    Intangible Assets (Including Affiliate)  
    
  The Partnership's intangible assets affiliate relate to above market coal transportation contracts with subsidiaries of Foresight Energy LP ("Foresight Energy"), pursuant to which it receives throughput fees for the handling and transportation of coal.  

Amortization expense related to the Partnership's intangible assets affiliate totaled   $0.9 million   and   $0.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Amortization expense related to the Partnership's intangible assets affiliate totaled   $2.3 million   and   $2.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Partnership's intangible assets consist of permits, aggregate-related trade names and other agreements as follows (in thousands): 

Amortization expense related to the Partnership's intangible assets totaled   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   for both the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

NRP LP Debt 
    
  NRP Senior Notes         
    
  In September 2013, the Partnership, together with NRP Finance Corporation ("NRP Finance"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, as co-issuer, issued   $300.0 million   of   9.125%   Senior Notes at an offering price of   99.007%   of par (the "NRP Senior Notes"). Net proceeds after expenses from the issuance of NRP Senior Notes were approximately   $289.0 million  . The NRP Senior Notes call for semi-annual interest payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and will mature on October 1, 2018. 
    
  In October 2014, the Partnership, together with NRP Finance as co-issuer, issued an additional   $125.0 million   of the NRP Senior Notes at an offering price of   99.5%   of par. The additional issuance constituted the same series of securities as the existing NRP Senior Notes. Net proceeds of   $122.6 million   from the additional issuance of the NRP Senior Notes were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of NRP s acquisition of non-operated working interests in oil and gas assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota.  
    
  The Partnership and NRP Finance have the option to redeem the NRP Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 1, 2016, at fixed redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the NRP Senior Notes (the "Indenture"). The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness. Under the Indenture, the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries generally are not permitted to incur additional indebtedness unless, on a consolidated basis, the fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is at least   2.0   to   1.0   for the four preceding full fiscal quarters. The ability of the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness is further limited in the event the amount of indebtedness of the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries that is senior to the Partnership's unsecured indebtedness exceeds certain thresholds. 
    
  Opco Debt 
    
  All of Opco s debt is guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiaries and is secured by certain of the assets of Opco and its wholly owned subsidiaries other than NRP Trona LLC, as further described below. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, Opco was in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in its debt agreements. 
    
  Opco Credit Facility 
    
  In June 2016, Opco entered into an amendment (the "First Amendment") to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Opco Credit Facility") that is guaranteed by all of Opco s wholly owned subsidiaries, and is secured by liens on certain of the assets of Opco and its subsidiaries, as further described below. Under the First Amendment: 
              
    The maximum leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the Opco Credit Facility) has been amended to remain at   4.0  x for the remaining term of the Opco Credit Facility, including for the period ending June 30, 2016; and 
                
    The asset sale covenant was amended to allow asset sales of up to   $300.0 million   from and after the effective date of the First Amendment; provided, however, that   75%   of the net cash proceeds of any such asset sales must be used to repay the Opco Credit Facility (without any corresponding commitment reduction) and/or NRP Opco s Senior Notes described below.    
        
  On the effective date of the First Amendment, the total commitment under the Opco Credit Facility was reduced from   $300.0 million   to   $260.0 million  . In addition, Opco and the lenders agreed to further reduce commitments under the Opco Credit Facility to (a)   $210.0 million   on December 31, 2016, (b)   $180.0 million   on June 30, 2017 and (c)   $150.0 million   on December 31, 2017. Opco will have the right to delay any of these commitment reductions by up to   90 days   each upon the agreement of the lenders holding   66.7%   of the then-existing commitments. To the extent any such commitment reduction is extended under the terms of the A R Revolving Credit Facility, Opco's ability to make distributions to the Partnership will be limited to amounts necessary for the Partnership to pay taxes and other general partnership expenses and make interest payments on its   9.125%   Senior Notes due 2018.

In addition to the 4.0x leverage ratio described above, the Opco Credit Facility requires Opco to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDDA to consolidated fixed charges (consisting of consolidated interest expense and consolidated lease expense) of not less than   3.5   to 1.0. As of   September 30, 2016  , Opco's leverage ratio was   2.95  x, and fixed charge coverage ratio was   5.46  x.    
    
  Effective on the date of the First Amendment, indebtedness under the Opco Credit Facility bears interest, at Opco's option, at: 
             
    the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by the agent bank; (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%  ; or (iii) LIBOR plus   1%  , in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from   2.50%   to   3.50%  ; or 
        
  The weighted average interest rates for the borrowings outstanding under the Opco Credit Facility for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   4.87%   and   3.05%  , respectively. The weighted average interest rates for the borrowings outstanding under the Opco Credit Facility for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   4.24%   and   2.41%  , respectively. 
    
  Opco will incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate of   0.50%   per annum. Opco may prepay all amounts outstanding under the Opco Credit Facility at any time without penalty. 
    
  The Opco Credit Facility contains certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations. Included in the investment covenant are restrictions upon Opco s ability to acquire assets where Opco does not maintain certain levels of liquidity. The Opco Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including cross-defaults under Opco s senior notes (as described below). 
    
  The Opco Credit Facility is collateralized and secured by liens on certain of Opco s assets with carrying values of   $680.5 million   and   $709.9 million   classified as Land, Plant and equipment and Mineral rights on the Partnership s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The collateral includes (1) the equity interests in all of Opco s wholly owned subsidiaries, other than NRP Trona LLC (which owns a   49%   non-controlling equity interest in Ciner Wyoming), (2) the personal property and fixtures owned by Opco s wholly owned subsidiaries, other than NRP Trona LLC, (3) Opco s material coal royalty revenue producing properties, (4) real property associated with certain of VantaCore s construction aggregates mining operations, and (5) certain of Opco s coal-related infrastructure assets. 
    
  Opco Senior Notes      
    
  Opco has issued several series of private placement senior notes (the "Opco Senior Notes") with various interest rates and principal due dates. As of   September 30, 2016  , and December 31, 2015, the Opco Senior Notes had cumulative principal balances of   $529.9 million   and   $585.9 million  , respectively. Opco made principal payments of   $56.0 million   on the Opco Senior Notes during both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
    
  The Note Purchase Agreements relating to the Opco Senior Notes contain covenants requiring Opco to:  
             
    maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the note purchase agreement) of no more than   4.0   to 1.0 for the four most recent quarters; 
                
    not permit debt secured by certain liens and debt of subsidiaries to exceed   10%   of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the note purchase agreement); and 
                
    maintain the ratio of consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the note purchase agreement) to consolidated fixed charges (consisting of consolidated interest expense and consolidated operating lease expense) at not less than   3.5   to 1.0. 
       
  The   8.38%   and   8.92%   Opco Senior Notes also provide that in the event that Opco s leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreements) exceeds   3.75   to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter, then in addition to all other interest accruing on these notes, additional interest in the amount of   2.00%   per annum shall accrue on the notes for the two succeeding quarters and for as long thereafter as the leverage ratio remains above   3.75   to 1.00. Opco has not exceeded the   3.75   to 1.00 ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter through   September 30, 2016  .

In September 2016, Opco amended the Opco Senior Notes. Under this amendment, Opco agreed to use certain asset sale proceeds to make mandatory prepayment offers on the Opco Senior Notes as follows: 
             
    Until the earlier of the time that (1) Opco has sold   $300 million   of assets and (2) June 30, 2020, Opco will be required to make prepayment offers to the holders of the Opco Senior Notes using   25%   of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales; and 
                
    After the earlier to occur of the dates above, Opco will be required to make prepayment offers to the holders of the Opco Senior Notes using an amount of net cash proceeds from certain asset sales that will be calculated pro-rata based on the amount of Opco Senior Notes then outstanding compared to the other total Opco senior debt outstanding that is being prepaid.   
       
  The mandatory prepayment offers described above will be made pro-rata across each series of outstanding Opco Senior Notes and will not require any make-whole payment by Opco. In addition, the remaining principal and interest payments on the Opco Senior Notes will be adjusted accordingly based on the amount of Opco Senior Notes actually prepaid. The prepayments do not affect the maturity dates of any series of the Opco Senior Notes. 
  NRP Oil and Gas Debt Classified as Liabilities of Discontinued Operations 
    
  RBL Facility       
    
  In August 2013, NRP Oil and Gas entered into the RBL Facility, a senior secured, reserve-based revolving credit facility, in order to fund capital expenditure requirements related to the development of the oil and gas assets in which it owned non-operated working interests. The RBL Facility was secured by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the assets of NRP Oil and Gas. NRP Oil and Gas was the sole obligor under the RBL Facility, and neither the Partnership nor any of its other subsidiaries was a guarantor of the RBL Facility. 
    
  At December 31, 2015, there was   $85.0 million   respectively, outstanding under the RBL Facility. As described in    Note 2. Discontinued Operations   , the Partnership included this debt and its related interest expense in discontinued operations. In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas LLC closed the sale of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the RBL Facility in full.  

9.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Partnership s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contracts receivable affiliate, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts reported on the Partnership's Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

  (Unaudited) 

The following table (in thousands) shows the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Partnership's debt, debt affiliate and contracts receivable affiliate: 

(1) 
    The Level 1 fair value is based upon quotations obtained for identical instruments on the closing trading prices near period end. 
              (2) 
    The Level 3 fair value is estimated by management using quotations obtained for comparable instruments on the closing trading prices near period end. 
              (3) 
    The Level 3 fair value approximates the outstanding borrowing amount because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the terms of the credit facility allow the Partnership to repay this debt at any time without penalty. 

10.    Related Party Transactions  
    
  Reimbursements to Affiliates of NRP's General Partner 
    
  The Partnership s general partner does not receive any management fee or other compensation for its management of Natural Resource Partners L.P. However, in accordance with the partnership agreement, the general partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for services provided to the Partnership and for expenses incurred on the Partnership s behalf. Employees of Quintana Minerals Corporation ("QMC") and Western Pocahontas Properties Limited Partnership ("WPPLP"), affiliates of the Partnership, provide their services to manage the Partnership's business. QMC and WPPLP charge the Partnership the portion of their employee salary and benefits costs related to their employee services provided to NRP. In addition, the Partnership receives non-cash equity contributions from its general partner related to compensation paid directly by the general partner and not reimbursed by the Partnership.  These amounts are presented as non-cash equity contributions on the Partnership's Consolidated Statements of Partners' Capital and were   $0.2 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These QMC and WPPLP employee management service costs and non-cash equity compensation expenses are presented as Operating and maintenance expenses affiliates, net and General and administrative affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. NRP also reimburses overhead costs incurred by its affiliates to manage the Partnership's business. These overhead costs include certain legal, accounting, treasury, information technology, insurance, administration of employee benefits and other corporate services incurred by the Partnership s general partner and its affiliates and are presented as Operating and maintenance expenses affiliates, net and General and administrative affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  
    
  The Partnership had Accounts payable affiliates to Quintana Minerals Corporation of   $0.5 million   and   $1.1 million  , including   $0.1 million   and   $0.7 million   related to discontinued operations at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, for services provided by Quintana Minerals Corporation to the Partnership. The Partnership had Accounts payable affiliates to WPPLP of   $0.5 million   and   $0.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  Cline Affiliates  
    
  Various companies controlled by Chris Cline, including Foresight Energy LP ("Foresight Energy"), lease coal reserves from the Partnership, and NRP also leases coal transportation assets to these companies for a fee. Mr. Cline owns a   31%   interest in the Partnership's general partner through his affiliate Adena Minerals, LLC, as well as approximately   0.5   million of the Partnership's common units at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Coal related revenues from Foresight Energy totaled   $20.6 million   and   $18.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Coal related revenues from Foresight Energy totaled   $47.6 million   and   $68.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Partnership had Accounts receivable affiliates from Foresight Energy of   $6.9 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively. The Partnership had recorded   $74.7 million   and   $82.6 million   in minimum royalty payments as Deferred revenue affiliates at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  NRP owns and leases rail load out and associated facilities to a subsidiary of Foresight Energy at Foresight Energy's Sugar Camp mine. The lease agreement is accounted for as a direct financing lease. Total projected remaining payments under the lease at   September 30, 2016   were   $77.7 million  , with unearned income of   $32.7 million  , and the net amount receivable was   $45.0 million  , of which   $2.1 million   is included in Accounts receivable affiliates while the remaining is included in Long-term contracts receivable affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total projected remaining payments under the lease at December 31, 2015 were   $81.2 million  , with unearned income of   $35.3 million   and the net amount receivable was   $45.9 million  , of which   $2.0 million   is included in Accounts receivable affiliates while the remaining is included in Long-term contracts receivable affiliates on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  NRP holds a contractual overriding royalty interest from a subsidiary of Foresight Energy that provides for payments based upon production from specific tons at Foresight Energy's Sugar Camp operations. This overriding royalty was accounted for as a financing arrangement and is reflected as an affiliate receivable. The net amount receivable under the agreement as of   September 30, 2016   was   $2.7 million  , of which   $1.4 million   is included in Accounts receivable affiliates, while the remaining is included in Long-term contracts receivable affiliate.  The net amount receivable under the agreement as of December 31, 2015 was   $4.9 million  , of which   $1.5 million   is included in Accounts receivable affiliates while the remaining is included in Long-term contracts receivable affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  NRP owns rail load out transportation assets and subcontracts out the operating responsibilities to an affiliate of Foresight Energy at Foresight's Williamson mine. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recorded operating and maintenance expenses affiliates of   $0.4 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, to operate these assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership recorded operating and maintenance expenses affiliates of   $0.3 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, to the operate these assets.

Holcomb, one of the Partnership s former directors, was a manager of Cline Trust Company, LLC (the "Cline Trust Company") as of December 31, 2015, that owned approximately   0.5 million   of the Partnership s common units and   $20.0 million   in principal amount of the Partnership s   9.125%   Senior Notes due 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the members of the Cline Trust Company were four trusts for the benefit of the children of Chris Cline, each of which owned an approximately equal membership interest in the Cline Trust Company. As of December 31, 2015, Mr. Holcomb also served as trustee of each of the four trusts.  The balance on this portion of the Partnership s   9.125%   Senior Notes due 2018 was   $19.9 million   as of December 31, 2015 and was included in Long-term debt, net affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.  In April 2016, Mr. Holcomb resigned from the Partnership's board of directors and as a result the   $19.9 million   debt balance held by Cline Trust Company was subsequently reclassified as Long-term debt, net on the Partnership's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Quintana Capital Group GP, Ltd.  
    
  Corbin J. Robertson, Jr. is a principal in Quintana Capital Group GP, Ltd. ("Quintana Capital"), which controls several private equity funds focused on investments in the energy business. In connection with the formation of Quintana Capital, the Partnership adopted a formal conflicts policy that establishes the opportunities that will be pursued by the Partnership and those that will be pursued by Quintana Capital. The governance documents of Quintana Capital s affiliated investment funds reflect the guidelines set forth in the Partnership's conflicts policy. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , a fund controlled by Quintana Capital owned a majority interest in Corsa Coal Corp. ("Corsa"), a coal mining company traded on the TSX Venture Exchange that is one of the Partnership s lessees in Tennessee. Corbin J. Robertson III, one of the Partnership s directors, is Chairman of the Board of Corsa. Coal related revenues from Corsa totaled   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively and   $1.9 million   and   $2.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The Partnership had recorded   $0.3 million   in minimum royalty payments as Deferred revenue affiliates at both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. The Partnership also had Accounts receivable affiliates totaling   $0.2 million   from Corsa at both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
    
  WPPLP Production Royalty and Overriding Royalty 
    
  The Partnership recorded   $0.0 million   and   $0.7 million   in operating and maintenance expenses affiliates related to a non-participating production royalty payable to WPPLP pursuant to a conveyance agreement entered into in 2007 for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Partnership recorded (  $0.1 million  ) and   $0.0 million   in operating and maintenance expenses affiliates related to this non-participating production royalty payable to WPPLP for the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership had Other assets affiliate from WPPLP of   $1.0 million   and   $1.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively related to a non-production royalty receivable from WPPLP for overriding royalty interest on a mine. 

11.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal  
    
  NRP is involved, from time to time, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, Partnership management believes these claims will not have a material effect on the Partnership s financial position, liquidity or operations. 
    
  Since 2013, several citizen group lawsuits have been filed against landowners alleging ongoing discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductivity, from valley fills located at reclaimed mountaintop removal mining sites in West Virginia. In each case, the mine on the subject property had been closed, the property had been reclaimed, and the state reclamation bond had been released. Any determination that a landowner or lessee has liability for discharges from a previously reclaimed mine site could result in substantial compliance costs or fines and would result in uncertainty as to continuing liability for completed and reclaimed coal mine operations. A subsidiary of the Partnership has been named as a defendant in one of these lawsuits. The Partnership currently cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential loss, if any, related to this matter.

Foresight Energy Disputes  
    
  In November 2015, a subsidiary of the Partnership filed a lawsuit against Foresight Energy s subsidiary, Hillsboro Energy LLC ("Hillsboro"), in the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Montgomery County, Illinois. The lawsuit alleges, among other items, breach of contract by Hillsboro resulting from a wrongful declaration of force majeure at Hillsboro s Deer Run mine in July 2015. In late March 2015, elevated carbon monoxide readings were detected at the Deer Run mine, and coal production at the mine was idled. In July 2015, the Partnership received the notice declaring a force majeure event at the mine as a result of the elevated carbon monoxide levels. The effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us minimum deficiency payments in arrears of   $7.5 million   per quarter, or   $30.0 million   per year. Foresight Energy's failure to make the deficiency payment with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first, second and third quarters of 2016 resulted in a cumulative   $38.5 million   negative cash impact to us. Such amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. The Partnership does not currently have an estimate as to when the mine will resume coal production. If the mine remains idled for an extended period or if the mine is permanently closed, the Partnership's financial condition and future cash flows will be adversely affected. 
    
  In April 2016, a subsidiary of the Partnership filed a lawsuit against Macoupin Energy, LLC ("Macoupin"), a subsidiary of Foresight Energy, in Macoupin County, Illinois. The lawsuit alleges that Macoupin has failed to comply with the terms of its coal mining, rail loadout and rail loop leases by incorrectly recouping previously paid minimum royalties. Foresight Energy s failure to properly calculate its recoupable balance and failure to make payments in accordance with these lease agreements with respect to certain periods resulted in a cumulative   $5.8 million   negative cash impact to us. While the Partnership plans to pursue its claim, a valuation allowance for the receivable amount has been recorded. It is possible that the Partnership s current estimate of the valuation allowance related to this matter could change, perhaps materially, in the future. 

12.    Major Customers  
    
  Revenues from customers that exceeded ten percent of total revenues and other income for either the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 are as follows (in thousands except for percentages): 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, total revenues and other income from Alpha Natural Resources included a   $6.0 million   non-recurring lease assignment fee. 

13.    Unit-Based Compensation 
    
  At the time of the Partnership's initial public offering, GP Natural Resource Partners LLC adopted the Natural Resource Partners Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Incentive Plan") for directors of GP Natural Resource Partners LLC and employees of its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership. The Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee ("CNG Committee") of GP Natural Resource Partners LLC s board of directors administers the Long-Term Incentive Plan and has historically approved annual awards of phantom units that vest   four years   from the date of grant. In February 2016, the CNG Committee adopted and the Board approved a new cash-based long-term incentive plan to the employees of its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership.  
    
  Subject to the rules of the exchange upon which the common units are listed at the time, the board of directors and the compensation committee of the board of directors have the right to alter or amend the Long-Term Incentive Plan or any part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan from time to time. Except upon the occurrence of unusual or nonrecurring events, no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially reduce the benefit intended to be made available to a participant without the consent of the participant.

NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.

  (Unaudited) 

Phantom units are incentive based equity awards issued to employees over a vesting period that entitle the grantee to receive the cash equivalent to the value of a unit of the Partnership's common units upon each vesting. The Partnership records compensation cost equal to the fair value of the award at the measurement date, which is determined to be the earlier of the performance commitment date or the service completion date. In addition, compensation cost for unvested phantom unit awards is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the Partnership s unit price. Under the plan a grantee will receive the market value of a common unit in cash upon vesting. Market value is defined as the average closing price over the   20   trading days prior to the vesting date. The compensation committee may make grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan to employees and directors containing such terms as it determines, including the vesting period. Outstanding grants vest upon a change in control of the Partnership, the general partner, or GP Natural Resource Partners LLC. If a grantee s employment or membership on the board of directors terminates for any reason, outstanding grants will be automatically forfeited unless and to the extent the compensation committee provides otherwise.  
    
  In connection with the phantom unit awards, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee also granted tandem Distribution Equivalent Rights ("DERs"), which entitle the holders to receive distributions equal to the distributions paid on the Partnership s common units between the date the units are granted and the vesting date. The DERs are payable in cash upon vesting but may be subject to forfeiture if the grantee ceases employment prior to vesting. 
    
  A summary of activity in the outstanding grants during 2016 is as follows (in thousands): 

Grants typically vest at the end of a   four  -year period and are paid in cash upon vesting. The Partnership recorded expenses related to its Long-Term Incentive Plan of   $0.7 million   and   $0.8 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Partnership also recorded a credit to expenses related to its Long-Term Incentive plan of   $0.2 million   and   $1.7 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30,   2015, respectively due to the decline in the market price of the Partnership's common units during the period.  
    
  In connection with the Long-Term Incentive Plan, payments are typically made during the first quarter of the year. Payments of   $1.5 million   and   $4.4 million   were made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The unaccrued cost associated with unvested outstanding grants and related DERs at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, was   $0.8 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 

14.    Cash Distributions

  The Partnership's supplemental cash flow information of continuing operations is summarized as follows (in thousands): 

16. Deferred Revenue and Deferred Revenue Affiliate 
    
  Most of the Partnership s coal and aggregates lessees must make minimum annual or quarterly payments which are generally recoupable over certain time periods. These minimum payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received. The deferred revenue attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as revenue based upon the underlying mineral lease when the lessee recoups the minimum payment through production or in the period immediately following the expiration of the lessee s ability to recoup the payments. The Partnership s deferred revenue (including affiliate) consist of the following (in thousands): 

The Partnership recognized the following amounts of deferred revenue (including affiliate) attributable to previously paid minimums as Coal royalty and other revenue (in thousands):  

Lease Modifications, Termination and Forfeitures of Minimum Royalty Balances 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership entered into agreements with certain lessees to either modify or terminate existing coal related leases that resulted in the Partnership recognizing   $40.4 million   of deferred revenue as follows: 
     An agreement that terminated a central Appalachia coal royalty lease and resulted in the lessee forfeiting the right to recoup   $26.2 million   of minimum royalties previously paid to the Partnership. The Partnership agreed to transfer its coal mineral rights that were subject to this former lease to the lessee. This terminated lease had no current or planned production and the mineral rights transferred had zero net book value on the Partnership's consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2016. As a result of this transaction, in April 2016 the Partnership recognized   $26.2 million   of revenue. 
     Lease modifications of existing coal royalty leases resulted in lessee forfeiture of rights to recoup previously paid minimum royalties and the reduction in lessee recoupment time. As a result of these modifications, in the first and second quarters of 2016 the Partnership recognized   $10.7 million   of revenue. 
     The Partnership recognized   $3.5 million   of revenue from various other coal and aggregates lease modifications, terminations and forfeitures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there was less than   $0.1 million   of revenue recognized from coal and aggregate lease modifications, terminations or forfeitures.

  Introduction

Executive Overview  
    
  We are a diversified natural resource company engaged principally in the business of owning, managing and leasing a diversified portfolio of mineral properties in the United States, including interests in coal, trona and soda ash, construction aggregates and other natural resources. Our business is organized into three operating segments: 
    
  Coal Royalty and Other   consists primarily of coal royalty and coal related transportation and processing assets.  Other assets include aggregate royalty, industrial mineral royalty, oil and gas royalty and timber. Our coal reserves are primarily located in Appalachia, the Illinois Basin and the Western United States. Our aggregates and industrial minerals are located in a number of states across the United States. As a result of the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets and exit from this oil and gas business in the third quarter of 2016, we transitioned management responsibilities and reporting of our oil and gas royalty assets into the Coal Royalty and Other operating segment. We have adjusted the corresponding items of segment information for prior periods to reflect this change.  In February 2016, we sold reserves and related royalty rights at three aggregates operations located in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee.  In February 2016, we also sold royalty and overriding royalty interests in several oil and gas producing properties located in the Appalachian Basin. 
    
  Soda Ash   consists of our 49% non-controlling equity interest in a trona ore mining operation and soda ash refinery in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. Ciner Resources LP, our operating partner, mines the trona, processes it into soda ash, and distributes the soda ash both domestically and internationally into the glass and chemicals industries. We receive regular quarterly distributions from this business.  
    
  VantaCore   consists of our construction materials business that operates hard rock quarries, an underground limestone mine, sand and gravel plants, asphalt plants and marine terminals. VantaCore   operates in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our financial results included (in thousands): 

(1) 
    See "Results of Operations" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  
       
  We continue to take proactive steps with a long-term view to address our debt maturities, and we have engaged Greenhill   Co., LLC to advise us in connection with these efforts. We are currently in active discussions with several institutional investors that may provide new equity capital to us. In addition, we have begun discussions with representatives of several holders of the NRP Senior Notes, and we may determine to pursue a refinancing or an exchange of some or all those notes.   
    
  As we pursue these capital markets transactions, we will continue to manage our business with a focus on debt reduction, cost management, and maximizing opportunities within our current asset base, including additional asset sales. The coal markets have shown improvement during the third quarter of 2016, particularly with respect to metallurgical coal, and we expect our coal royalty business to benefit from the higher pricing environment. However, to the extent that we are unable to execute on our opportunistic capital raising and/or debt refinancing efforts on favorable terms and the coal markets do not show a sustained improvement, our liquidity may be adversely affected. Accordingly, we may consider other alternatives over the next several months to manage our liquidity and address our 2018 debt maturities.

Current Liquidity, Management s Forecast and Going Concern Analysis 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of   $92.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reduced our debt by approximately $171.2 million by repaying $85.0 million of the NRP Oil and Gas reserve based lending facility (the "RBL Facility"), $56.0 of the Opco Private Placement Notes (as defined below), $30.0 million of the Opco Credit Facility (as defined below) and $0.2 million of our Opco utility local improvement obligation 
    
  While we have a diversified portfolio of assets and a history and continued forecast of profitable operations with positive operating cash flows, our operating results and credit metrics have been impacted by challenges in coal and other commodity markets. The following going concern analysis includes an evaluation of relevant conditions and events, including our business performance and forecast, and our ability to meet our obligations and remain in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months. 
    
  The Partnership has $425.0 million in 9.125% Senior Notes maturing in October 2018 (the "NRP Senior Notes"). As of   September 30, 2016  , Opco had   $260.0 million   of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility (the "Opco Credit Facility") with scheduled commitment reductions of   $50.0 million   on December 31, 2016,   $30.0 million   on June 30, 2017,   $30.0 million   on December 31, 2017 and the remaining   $150 million   on June 30, 2018. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   Opco had   $529.9 million   outstanding under several series of Private Placement Notes with scheduled principal payments of   $80.8 million   through September 30, 2017 (the "Opco Private Placement Notes") (collectively referred to as the "Opco Debt agreements"). The maximum leverage ratio under the Opco Debt agreements is required not to exceed   4.0  x. In addition, the Opco Debt agreements contain certain additional customary negative covenants that, among other items, restrict Opco s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens on its assets, make investments, sell assets and engage in business combinations.  
    
  We currently forecast that we will meet our obligations, including scheduled principal and interest payments, that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants, and that we will continue as a going concern. However, our forecast is sensitive to commodity demand and pricing and counterparty risk. In addition, the debt principal payments scheduled in 2017 will strain our liquidity. Inability to make these payments would result in an event of default and could result in Opco s lenders accelerating Opco s debt. Breaches of the Opco debt covenants that are not waived or cured, to the extent possible, would have a similar effect. Any such acceleration by the Opco lenders would result in a cross-default under the NRP Indenture. We are currently pursuing or considering a number of actions in order to manage our liquidity and mitigate the effects of adverse market developments that could affect our ability to repay debt and comply with the covenants under our debt agreements.  
    
  Current Results/Market Outlook 
    
  Coal Royalty and Other Business Segment  
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our Coal Royalty and Other business segment financial results included the following (in thousands):  

(1) 
    See "Results of Operations" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  
       
  We stands to benefit from recent improvements in both the thermal and metallurgical coal markets.  The metallurgical coal markets in particular have improved significantly over the last few months, with global contract and spot prices in excess of $200 per ton due to supply shortages caused by China s recent production cutbacks, operational disruptions in Australia, and the significant number of mine closures in the United States. As a result of the increased pricing, some of the higher-quality coal from our properties that is typically sold by our lessees into the thermal market is now being sold by our lessees into the metallurgical markets, which command a higher price per ton than the thermal markets. We expect this trend to continue to the extent the metallurgical markets  
  
   28 

show sustained improvements.  We derived approximately 32% of our coal royalty revenues and approximately 37% of the related production from metallurgical coal during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The domestic thermal coal markets have also shown modest improvements, as production cuts over the last year have rationalized coal stockpiles. Higher recent natural gas prices have also caused thermal coal to be more competitive for electricity generation. Despite these improvements, U.S. coal producers remain under pressure as a result of a strong U.S. Dollar, continued excessive governmental regulation of coal-fired power generation facilities, and an oversupply of natural gas. In particular, producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal continue to face challenges, as their production costs remain high relative to sales prices. We have successfully navigated the bankruptcies of several of our lessees, including Alpha Natural Resources, and have had substantially all of our leases assumed or assigned and received substantially all past-due amounts in these bankruptcies.   
    
  Production from our Illinois Basin properties decreased by   27%   in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Substantially all of the decrease is attributable to the idling of Foresight Energy's Deer Run mine (which we also refer to as our Hillsboro property) as a result of elevated carbon monoxide levels at the mine beginning in March 2015. In July 2015, we received a notice from Foresight Energy declaring a resulting force majeure event at the Deer Run mine. While we have filed a lawsuit disputing Foresight Energy s claim of force majeure, the effect of a valid force majeure declaration would relieve Foresight Energy of its obligation to pay us quarterly minimum deficiency payments with respect to the Deer Run mine until mining resumes. Under the lease for the Deer Run mine, Foresight Energy is required to make minimum deficiency payments to us of $7.5 million per quarter, or $30.0 million per year. The amount payable to us as the minimum deficiency payment with respect to any quarter is reduced by the amount of coal royalties actually paid to us for tonnage sold at the mine with respect to that quarter. We received royalty payments on tonnage sold from coal stockpiles at the Deer Run mine during 2015, but these stockpiles have been depleted. Foresight Energy s failure to make the deficiency payments with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first, second and third quarters of 2016 resulted in a cumulative negative cash impact to us of $38.5 million. Such amount will increase for each quarter during which mining operations continue to be idled. Foresight Energy has temporarily sealed the mine, and is continuing efforts to cure the elevated carbon monoxide levels, but we do not know when, or if, mining activities at the Deer Run mine will recommence. 
    
  Soda Ash Business Segment

    See "Results of Operations" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  
       
  Income from our trona mining and soda ash refinery investment was lower year-over-year for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This decrease is primarily related to lower international prices compared to the prior year, in addition to higher royalty and G A costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher production compared to the prior year. Ciner Resources LP, our partner that controls and operates Ciner Wyoming, is a publicly traded master limited partnership that depends on distributions from Ciner Wyoming in order to make distributions to its public unitholders.

VantaCore Business Segment 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our VantaCore business segment financial results included the following (in thousands):  

(1) 
    See "Results of Operations" below for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  
       
  VantaCore s construction aggregates mining and production business is largely dependent on the strength of the local markets that it serves. VantaCore s Laurel Aggregates operation in southwestern Pennsylvania serves producers and oilfield service companies operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and was impacted during the first   nine   months of 2016 by the slowing pace of exploration and development of natural gas in those areas due to low natural gas prices. Increased local construction activity partially offset these declines during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , but we expect that Laurel s business will continue to be impacted by decreased natural gas development activities. While VantaCore's production and revenues have declined in 2016 compared to 2015, it's cost management efforts have enabled the business to maintain its profitability. 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  In July 2016, NRP Oil and Gas closed on the sale of its non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in the Williston Basin for   $116.1 million  , subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. The Partnership's exit from its non-operated oil and gas working interest business represented a strategic shift to reduce debt and focus on its soda ash, coal royalty and construction aggregates business segments. As a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities, operating results and cash flows of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Results of Operations  
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues and Other Income 
    
  Revenues and other income   decreased     $16.1 million  , or   14%  , from   $114.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $97.9 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table shows our diversified sources of revenues and other income by business segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands except for percentages): 

The changes in revenue and other income is discussed for each of the Partnership's business segments below: 

31 

Coal Royalty and Other 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our Coal Royalty and Other segment   decreased     $6.8 million  , or   11%  , from   $62.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $55.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The table below presents coal production and coal royalty revenues (including affiliates) derived from our major coal producing regions and the significant categories of other coal royalty and other revenues:  

(1)    Northern Appalachia was impacted by a prior period adjustment of 0.5 million tons and less than $0.1 million in royalty revenue primarily related to the Hibbs Run mine that ceased production during 2016. Absent this adjustment, production in the Northern Appalachia region was 0.2 million tons, average revenue per ton was $1.97 and revenue was $0.4 million. 

32 

Total coal production   decreased     4.0 million   tons, or   35%  , from   11.4 million   tons in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   7.4 million   tons in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Total coal royalty revenues   decreased     $11 million  , or   29%  , from   $38.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $27.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Total production and revenue decreased driven by downward pressure in the coal markets as described above, with Central Appalachian thermal coal producers in particular continuing to face challenges, as their production costs remain high relative to sales prices. 
    
  Soda Ash 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our equity investment in Ciner Wyoming   decreased     $1.8 million  , or   14%  , from   $12.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $10.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to (i) higher royalty rates for certain leases, (ii) higher G A costs from increased investment in information technology and (iii) higher variable costs and DD A resulting from greater soda ash production quarter-over-quarter. These decreases at Ciner Wyoming were partially offset by increased sale revenue resulting from higher soda ash production quarter-over-quarter. 
    
  VantaCore 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment   decreased     $7.4 million  , or   19%  , from   $39.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $31.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily due to a decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone revenue as well as reduced delivery and fuel income quarter-over-quarter. Tonnage sold by the VantaCore segment   decreased     0.3 million   tons, or   14%   from   2.1 million   tons in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   1.8 million   tons in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of decreased construction aggregates demand in the oil and gas services sector that was partially offset by increased construction aggregates sales into the construction market. 
    
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates) 
    
  Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates)   decreased     $4.2 million  , or   11%  , from   $39.5 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $35.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to the following: 
    
  VantaCore 
    
  Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) in our VantaCore segment   decreased     $5.8 million  , or   18%   from   $32.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $26.9 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily due to the decline in materials cost as a result of the decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone sales volume quarter-over-quarter due to reduced demand in the oil and gas sector, a decrease in delivery and fuel costs due to the lower construction aggregates production and brokered stone purchases quarter over quarter and effective variable cost management. 
    
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD A") Expense  
    
  DD A expense   decreased     $3.6 million  , or   22%  , from   $16.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $12.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to the reduction of the cost basis of our coal and aggregates royalty mineral rights due to the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the decline in coal royalty production quarter-over-quarter. 
    
  General and Administrative (including affiliates) ("G A") Expense 
    
  Corporate and financing G A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs   increased     $0.9 million  , or   21%  , from   $4.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   is primarily related to increased legal and advisory fees related to the implementation of our long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity. 

33 

Asset Impairments  
    
  Asset impairments   decreased     $356.0 million  , or   98%  , from   $361.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $5.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to   $247.8 million   in coal property impairment,   $70.5 million   in oil and gas property impairment and   $43.4 million   in hard mineral property impairment recorded during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to   $3.8 million   in coal property impairment and   $1.4 million   in hard mineral property impairment recorded during the third quarter of 2016.  The impairments in 2015 primarily resulted from the continued deterioration and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, sustained low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations  
    
  Income from discontinued operations increased   $276.4 million  , from a loss of   $269.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to income of   $7.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The change in income (loss) from discontinued operations is primarily related to the   $265.1 million   asset impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2015, the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets that was completed in July 2016 with an effective date of April 1, 2016 and the   $8.5 million   gain recorded in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) from continuing operations less equity earnings from unconsolidated investment, gain on reserve swaps and income to non-controlling interest; plus distributions from equity earnings in unconsolidated investment, interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization and asset impairments.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net income or loss attributable to partners, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, liquidity or ability to service debt obligations. There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance, including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring items that materially affect our net income (loss), the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA   decreased     $11.5 million  , or   16%  , from   $70.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $58.9 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The   decrease   is primarily a result of decreased coal production and coal royalty revenue per ton quarter-over-quarter driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above. 

34 

The following table (in thousands) reconciles net income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA by business segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

35 

Distributable Cash Flow, or "DCF"     (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)  
    
  DCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations, plus returns of unconsolidated equity investments, proceeds from sales of assets, including those included in discontinued operations, and returns of long-term contract receivables affiliate, less maintenance capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interest.  
    
  DCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. DCF may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies. 
    
  DCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner and repay debt.  
    
  DCF   increased     $102.0 million  , or   188%  , from   $54.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $156.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   is due primarily to the   $109.9 million   net cash proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operation, partially offset by lower coal production, lower coal royalty revenue per ton and lower minimum royalty payments received from our coal leases. These decreases are driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above. 
    
  The following table (in thousands) presents the three major categories of the statement of cash flows by business segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015:

Results of Operations  
    
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues and Other Income 
    
  Revenues and other income   decreased     $21.9 million  , or   7%  , from   $333.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $311.9 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table shows our diversified sources of revenues and other income by business segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands except for percentages): 

The changes in revenue and other income is discussed for each of the Partnership's business segments below: 

37 

Coal Royalty and Other 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our Coal Royalty and Other segment   increased     $3.1 million  , or   2%  , from   $190.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $193.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The table below presents coal production and coal royalty revenues (including affiliates) derived from our major coal producing regions and the significant categories of other coal royalty and other revenues:  

Total coal production   decreased     15.0 million   tons, or   41%  , from   36.5 million   tons in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   21.5 million   tons in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Total coal royalty revenues   decreased     $41.9 million  , or   37%  , from   $113.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $71.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Total production and royalty revenue decreased in all of our regions. These decreases are driven by downward pressure in  
  
   38 

the coal markets, with producers of Central Appalachian thermal coal in particular continuing to face challenges, as their production costs remain high relative to sales prices. 
    
  The decrease in coal royalty revenues was partially offset by a   $48.0 million   increase in minimums recognized as revenues due to several lease modifications and terminations in the second quarter of 2016 as well as a   $20.3 million   increase in gains on asset sales due to the sales of our oil and gas royalty and aggregates royalty businesses in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Soda Ash 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our equity investment in Ciner Wyoming   decreased     $6.0 million  , or   16%  , from   $36.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $30.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to lower international prices compared to the prior year, in addition to higher royalty and G A costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher production compared to the prior year. 
    
  VantaCore 
    
  Revenues and other income related to our VantaCore segment   decreased     $18.9 million  , or   18%  , from   $107.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $88.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily due to a decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone revenue as well as lower delivery and fuel income year-over-year. Tonnage sold by the VantaCore segment   decreased     0.7 million   tons, or   12%   from   5.7 million   tons in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   5.0 million   tons in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of decreased construction aggregates demand in the oil and gas services sector that was partially offset by increased aggregates sales into the construction market. 
    
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses (including affiliates) 
    
  Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates)   decreased     $16.6 million  , or   15%  , from   $114.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $97.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to the following: 
    
  VantaCore 
    
  Operating and maintenance expenses (including affiliates) in our VantaCore segment   decreased     $17.2 million  , or   19%   from   $90.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $73.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily due to the decline in materials cost as a result of the decrease in construction aggregates and brokered stone volume year-over-year due to reduced demand in the oil and gas sector and a decrease in delivery and fuel costs due to the lower construction aggregates production and brokered stone purchases year-over-year partially and effective variable cost management. 
    
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD A") Expense  
    
  DD A expense   decreased     $12.5 million  , or   27%  , from   $47.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $34.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to the reduction in the cost basis of our coal and aggregates royalty mineral rights due to the asset impairments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the decline in coal royalty production year-over-year.  
  General and Administrative (including affiliates) ("G A") Expense 
    
  Corporate and financing G A expense (including affiliates) includes corporate headquarters, financing and centralized treasury and accounting. These costs   increased     $3.5 million  , or   36%  , from   $9.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $13.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   is primarily related to increased legal and consulting fees related to the implementation of our long-term plan to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce debt and enhance liquidity. 

39 

Asset Impairments  
    
  Asset impairments   decreased     $357.8 million  , or   98%  , from   $365.5 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $7.7 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   decrease   is primarily related to   $249.4 million   in coal property impairment,   $70.5 million   in oil and gas property impairment and   $43.4 million   in hard mineral property impairment recorded during the first nine months 2015 as compared to   $3.9 million   in coal property impairment and   $1.7 million   in hard mineral property impairment recorded during the first nine months of 2016.  The impairments in 2015 primarily resulted from the continued deterioration and expectations of further reductions in global and domestic coal demand due to reduced global steel demand, sustained low natural gas prices, and continued regulatory pressure on the electric power generation industry. 
    
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations  
    
  Income from discontinued operations   increased     $282.0 million  , from a loss of   $280.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to income of   $2.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The change in income (loss) from discontinued operations is primarily related to the   $265.1 million   asset impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2015, the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets that was completed in July 2016 with an effective date of April 1, 2016 and the   $8.3 million   gain on sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA   increased     $6.3 million  , or   3%  , from   $198.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $204.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase is primarily a result of   $48.0 million   increase in minimums recognized as revenue primarily as a result of coal lease modifications or terminations that resulted in our lessee forfeiting their minimum royalty balances. Adjusted EBITDA also increased due to   $20.4 million   of additional gains on asset sales as compared to the same period in 2015. These increases were partially offset   $41.9 million   in reduced coal royalty revenue resulting from decreased in coal production and coal royalty revenue per ton driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above, a   $6.0 million   non-recurring 2015 lease assignment fee and   $5.4 million   of reduced aggregates royalty revenue in 2016 due to decreased 2016 aggregates production and sales. In addition, this increase was partially offset by   $3.5 million   of additional G A expense in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 as described above.

The following table (in thousands) reconciles net income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA by business segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

41 

DCF     (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)  
    
  DCF   increased     $96.2 million  , or   68%  , from   $142.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $238.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   is due primarily to the   $109.9 million   net cash proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operation in addition to   $54.2 million   in net cash proceeds from sales of mineral rights in 2016. These increases were partially offset by lower coal royalty production, lower coal royalty revenue per ton and less minimum payments received from our coal leases. These decreases are driven by the continued pressure on U.S. coal producers as described above. 
    
  The following table (in thousands) presents the three major categories of the statement of cash flows by business segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

42 

The following table (in thousands) reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) by business segment to DCF for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Overview 
    
  For an overview of our liquidity and related matters, see " Executive Overview Current Liquidity, Management's Forecast and Going Concern Analysis." Generally, we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations. Our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately   $50.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to $81.0 million in total principal payments on the Opco Senior Notes and $80.0 million of payments on the Opco Credit Facility. Excluding these payments, net of their unamortized debt issue costs, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately   $108.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  A portion of the capital expenditures associated with our VantaCore segment are maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to maintain the long-term production capacity of those businesses. We deduct maintenance capital expenditures when calculating DCF.  

43 

Cash Flows 
    
  Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $78.7 million, from   $161.4 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $82.7 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Operating cash flow from continuing operations   decreased     $58.5 million   in our Coal Royalty and Other segment year-over-year primarily as a result of the reduction in coal royalty revenue and reduction of coal royalty minimum cash payments received on certain leases. Cash flow provided by operating activities of discontinued operations decreased $21.0 million, from   $29.2 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $8.2 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of completing the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016 that had an effective date of April 1, 2016. 
    
  Cash flow provided by investing activities increased $184.8 million, from   $24.5 million   cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $160.3 million   cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Investing cash flows from discontinued operations increased $139.4 million primarily as a result of the sale of our non-operated oil and gas working interest assets in July 2016 for   $109.9 million   in net cash proceeds. Investing cash flows from continuing operations increased $45.4 million primarily as a result of 2016 sales of royalty properties as described in    Note 6. Mineral Rights    to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Cash flow used in financing activities increased $76.6 million, from   $125.8 million   cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to   $202.4 million   cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations increased $139.4 million primarily as a result of using $85.0 million to repay the RBL Credit Facility and contributing the $40.2 million of discontinued asset sales proceeds that remained after repayment of the RBL Facility in full to continuing operations. This $139.4 million increase in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by a $62.8 million decrease in cash flow used in financing activities from continuing operations. This decrease is primarily a result of distributing $49.3 million less cash to partners and receiving the remaining net proceeds from discontinuing operations after repayment as described above.  
    
  Capital Resources and Obligations 
    
  Indebtedness 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 we had the following indebtedness (in thousands): 

We were and continue to be in compliance with the terms of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements. For additional information regarding our debt and the agreements governing our debt, including the covenants contained therein, see    Note 8. Debt and Debt Affiliate    to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Shelf Registration Statement 
    
  In September 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of common units. 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly, there are no off-balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities.

Related Party Transactions 
    
  The information required set forth under    Note 10. Related Party Transactions    to the consolidated financial statements under the caption "Related Party Transactions" is incorporated herein by reference. 

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Standards 
    
  The information set forth under    Note 1. Basis of Presentation    to the consolidated financial statements under the caption "Basis of Presentation" is incorporated herein by reference.  

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed to market risk, which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below: 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are dependent upon the effective marketing of the coal mined by our lessees. Our lessees sell the coal under various long-term and short-term contracts as well as on the spot market. Current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more. Our lessees  failure to negotiate long-term contracts could adversely affect the stability and profitability of our lessees  operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues. If more coal is sold on the spot market, coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in spot coal prices. 
  We have market risk related to prices for our aggregates products. Aggregates prices are primarily driven by economic conditions in the local markets in which the products are sold. 
  The market price of soda ash directly affects the profitability of Ciner Wyoming s operations. If the market price for soda ash declines, Ciner Wyoming s sales will decrease. Historically, the global market and, to a lesser extent, the domestic market for soda ash have been volatile, and those markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan, which are subject to variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. At   September 30, 2016  , we had $260.0 million outstanding in variable interest rate debt. If interest rates were to increase by 1%, annual interest expense would increase approximately $2.6 million, assuming the same principal amount remained outstanding during the year. 

45 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  NRP carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NRP management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of the general partner of NRP. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in the Partnership s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting during the first   nine   months of 2016 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.  
  
   46 

PART II 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are involved, from time to time, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe these claims will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity or operations. 
    
  For more information regarding certain other legal proceedings involving the Partnership, see Note 11. "Commitments and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.  

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  
    
  During the period covered by this report there were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Natural Resource Partners L.P. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
    
  None. 

ITEM 3.  DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES  
    
  None.  

ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Exhibit 95.1 
  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
    
  Our mining operations are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ). We have disclosed below information regarding certain citations and orders issued by MSHA and related assessments and legal actions with respect to these mining operations.  In evaluating the below information regarding mine safety and health, investors should take into account factors such as: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of a mine; (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine; and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed or vacated.  The tables below do not include any orders or citations issued to independent contractors at our mines. 
  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) requires issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) certain information relating to citations and orders for violations of standards under the Mine Act.  The following tables disclose information required under the Dodd-Frank Act for the 3-month period ending September 30   th   , 2016. 

(1) 
    Mine Act section 104 S S citations shown above are for alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a mine health and safety hazard.  It should be noted that, for purposes of this table, S S citations that are included in another column, such as Section 104(d) citations, are not also included as Section 104 S S citations in this column.   
              (2) 
    Mine Act section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the time period specified in the citation. 
              (3) 
    Mine Act section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure (  i.e.  , aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence) to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 
              (4) 
    Mine Act section 110(b)(2) violations are for an alleged  flagrant  failure (  i.e.  , reckless or repeated) to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory safety or health standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. 
              (5) 
    Mine Act section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition.  
              (6)   
    Amounts shown include assessments proposed by MSHA during the three-month period ending September 30   th   , 2016 on all citations and orders, including those citations and orders that are not required to be included within the above chart.   

(1)  
    Mine Act section 104(e) written notices are for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a mine safety or health hazard. 
       
  The number of legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as of September 30   th   , 2016 that fall into each of the following categories is as follows:
