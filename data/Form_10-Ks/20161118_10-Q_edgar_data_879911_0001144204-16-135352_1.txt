1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying interim
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Energetics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary
North Star Power Engineering, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 (collectively,  company,   Applied Energetics, 
 we,   our  or  us ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for
the interim periods presented have been made. The results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016,
may not be indicative of the results for the entire year. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the company's audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Certain amounts from the 2015 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Liquidity and Management s Plan 

Applied Energetics,
Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W
Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415. 

Starting in the fourth
quarter of 2014 and through the third quarter of 2016, the company reported as a  shell company  as such term is defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended due to the suspension its previous business activities in October,
2014. The company expects to emerge from shell company status when it completes a financing sufficient to fund its planned research
and development programs. 

The accompanying unaudited
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company incurred a net loss
of approximately $394,000, had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $127,000 and expects to incur additional future
losses due to the reactivation of its business activities. These matters raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability
to continue as a going concern unless the company is able to obtain additional financing for its continuing operations. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount or classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The company s
website is www.appliedenergetics.net. 

As of September 30,
2016, the company had approximately $10,000 in cash and cash equivalents. 

USE OF ESTIMATES  

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP )
requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other estimates that it believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, management considers the basis and methodology
used in developing and selecting these estimates, the trends in and amounts of these estimates, specific matters affecting the
amount of and changes in these estimates, and any other relevant matters related to these estimates, including significant issues
concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future,
as more information becomes known which could materially impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Significant estimates
include measurements of income tax assets and liabilities.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

The company has reviewed
issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The company does not expect the adoption of
any other pronouncements to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position. 

2.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  

Share-Based Compensation   Directors
and Contractors  

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $63,000 and $-0-, respectively. 

There was no related
income tax benefit recognized because our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance. 

We determine the fair value of option grant
share-based awards at their grant date, using a Black-Scholes-Merton Option-Pricing Model. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Mr. George P. Farley, the company s CEO, was granted 5,000,000 shares of common stock under the
2007 Plan, and two contractors were granted a total of 3,000,000 shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, 32,000 options to purchase stock expired, additionally, no options to purchase stock were granted, exercised
or forfeited; no restricted stock units were granted, vested or forfeited; and no restricted stock awards were granted, vested
or forfeited. At September 30, 2016, options to purchase -0- shares of common stock were outstanding. 

3.    SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS  

We had no revenue in the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

4.    NET LOSS PER SHARE  

Basic net loss per
common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period before giving effect to stock options, stock warrants, restricted stock units and convertible securities
outstanding, which are considered to be dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated based
on the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period after giving effect to convertible
preferred stock, stock options, warrants and restricted stock units. Contingently issuable shares are included in the computation
of basic loss per share when issuance of the shares is no longer contingent. Due to the losses from continuing operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, basic and diluted loss per common share were the same, as the effect of potentially
dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive. 

Potentially dilutive
securities not included in the diluted loss per share calculation, due to net losses from continuing operations, were as follows:

5.    DIVIDENDS  

Dividends on Preferred
Stock are accrued when the amount and kind of the dividend is determined and are payable quarterly on the first day of February,
May, August and November, in cash or shares of common stock. The holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive dividends at the initial rate of 6.5% of the liquidation preference per share (the  Initial Dividend Rate ),
payable, at the option of the corporation, in cash or shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. Upon the
occurrence of the company's failure to pay dividends in the five business days following a dividend payment date (a  Payment
Default ), the dividend rate shall immediately and automatically increase to 7.5% of the liquidation preference per share
for as long as such Payment Default continues (or return to the Initial Dividend Rate at such time as such Payment Default no longer
continues), and if a Payment Default shall occur on two consecutive Dividend Payment Dates, the dividend rate shall immediately
and automatically increase to 10% of the Liquidation Preference for as long as such Payment Default continues and shall immediately
and automatically return to the Initial Dividend Rate at such time as the Payment Default is no longer continuing. 

As of September 30,
2016, we had 13,602 shares of our 6.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding. The company has not paid the dividends
commencing with the quarterly dividend due August 1, 2013. Dividend arrearages as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $111,000.
Our Board of Directors suspended the declaration of the dividend, commencing with the dividend payable as of February 1, 2015 since
we did not have a surplus (as such term is defined in the Delaware general corporation Law) as of December 31, 2014, until such
time as we have a surplus or net profits for a fiscal year. 

Our Series A Preferred
Stock has a liquidation preference of $25.00 per Share. The Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at the rate of 6.5% of the
liquidation preference per share per annum, which accrues from the date of issuance, and is payable quarterly. Dividends may be
paid in: (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock (valued for such purpose at 95% of the weighted average of the last sales prices
of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable
dividend payment date), provided that the issuance and/or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an
effective registration statement or (iii) any combination of the foregoing. If the Company fails to make a dividend payment within
five business days following a dividend payment date, the dividend rate shall immediately and automatically increase by 1% from
6.5% of the liquidation preference per offered share of Series A preferred stock to 7.5% of such liquidation preference. If a payment
default shall occur on two consecutive dividend payment dates, the dividend rate shall immediately and automatically increase to
10% of the liquidation preference for as long as such payment default continues and shall immediately and automatically return
to the Initial dividend rate at such time as the payment default is no longer continuing. 

In the fourth quarter
of 2015, the company purchased 93,570 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for approximately $58,000. The company
cancelled the shares and returned them to unissued status. The company also reversed approximately $331,000 of accrued dividends
payable. 

6.    SUBSEQUENT EVENT  

The company s
management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after September 30, 2016, the date of our most recent balance sheet, through
the date our financial statements were issued. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Our discussion and
analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related disclosures included elsewhere herein and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

Certain statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Forward-looking
statements include all statements that do not relate solely to the historical or current facts, and can be identified by the use
of forward looking words such as  may ,  believe ,  will ,  would ,  could ,
 should ,  expect ,  project ,  anticipate ,  estimates ,  possible ,
 plan ,  strategy ,  target ,  prospect  or  continue  and other similar terms
and phrases. These forward looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of our management and are subject
to a number of uncertainties and risks that could significantly affect our current plans and expectations, as well as future results
of operations and financial condition and may cause our actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are described in Item 1A. (Risk Factors) of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. We do not assume any
obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors
affecting such forward-looking statements. 

Overview  

Starting in the fourth
quarter of 2014 and through the third quarter of 2016, the company reported as a  shell company  as such term is defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended due to the suspension its previous business activities in October,
2014. The company expects to emerge from shell company status when it completes a financing sufficient to fund its planned research
and development programs. 

The company owns intellectual property
that is integral and necessary for the development of Ultra-Short Pulse ( USP ) Lasers, Laser Guided Energy and Direct
Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial applications (the  Products ). AOS and Dr. McCahon have the
facilities and technical knowhow to utilize the company s intellectual property in the development of the Products. The parties
have agreed to cooperate in the proposal and fulfillment of research and development contracts for branches of the Department of
Defense, agencies of the Federal Government and other Defense contractors and in other research and development activities relating
to lasers. We intend to develop the next generation of USP Lasers. The company and AOS have a research and development program
for the next stage of LGE development that involves the development of Advanced USP Laser Technologies. These lasers will allow
for LGE weapon systems to be mounted on mobile platforms for multiple anti-terrorist missions including counter measures against
drones and other hostile inbound objects, counter-improvised explosive devices ( C-IED ) and vehicle stopping, and
many others. Importantly, the highly advanced USP Laser technologies required for successful LGE deployment leads to many new and
unique laser opportunities in commercial, medical, and military markets. Our goal is to increase the range and power and to decrease
the size weight and cost of USP Lasers. We expect to develop very high energy and power scaling USP Lasers that have a very broad
range of applicability for Department of Defense, commercial and medical applications. We are in discussions with and expect to
team with a major Defense Contractor for co-development and manufacture of military products. We will also team with a leading
commercial laser technology manufacturer for co-development of commercial products resulting from our research and development
efforts.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

COMPARISON OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015:  

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 

General and administrative
expenses increased approximately $100,000 to $145,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in professional expenses of $110,000 partially offset by a reduction
of $11,000 of supplies, insurance and miscellaneous fees. 

OTHER INCOME  

Interest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 reduced slightly from the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to our reduced interest
bearing balances. 

NET LOSS  

Our operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in a net loss of approximately $145,000, an increase of approximately $100,000
compared to the $45,000 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

COMPARISON OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015:  

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  

General and administrative expenses increased
approximately $206,000 to $396,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $190,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in professional and consulting expenses of $188,000, non-cash compensation of $63,000,
travel related of $3,000, miscellaneous of $2,000 partially offset by a reduction of $34,000 of supplies, insurance and miscellaneous
fees and $16,000 of building expenses. . 

OTHER INCOME  

Other income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an approximate $3,000 refund from the
LGE product line. The gain on asset disposal for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 represents gain on disposal of assets. 

NET LOSS  

Our operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 resulted in a net loss of approximately $394,000, an increase of approximately $205,000 compared to the $189,000
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

At September 30, 2016,
we had approximately $10,000 of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of approximately $127,000 from December 31, 2015. During
the first nine months of 2016 the net cash outflow from operating activities was approximately $127,000. This amount was comprised
primarily of our net loss of $394,000 and an increase in prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets of $2,000, partially offset
by an increase in our accrued expenses and deposits of $197,000 noncash stock based compensation of $63,000 and an increase in
accounts payable of $10,000. Investing activities and financing activities reflected no activity, resulting in net cash outflow
of approximately $127,000. 

In their report accompanying
our financial statements, our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 were
prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern, and that they have substantial doubt as to our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our auditors  have noted that our recurring losses from operations and need to raise additional capital
to sustain operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

BACKLOG OF ORDERS  

At November 5, 2016,
we had a backlog (workload remaining on signed contracts) of $0, to be completed within the next twelve months. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES  

Our management, with
the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, there was no significant change in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially
affected or which is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
