  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   August 31, 2016    

Note
1 - Organization and Description of Business   

iHealthcare Inc. (formerly Opulent Acquisition,
Inc.) (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014. The Company intended to serve
as a vehicle to affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or
foreign business. The Company originally elected November 30th as its year end but has applied to change its fiscal year end to
December 31. As of now however, the fiscal year is November 30th. 

On January 14, 2016 Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio,
the sole shareholder of the Company transferred to iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company, 20,000,000 shares of our common stock
which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of transfer, in consideration of $25,000. The transfer was
the result of the sale of the Company to iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. The result of the January 14, 2016 transaction
was iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) became the wholly owned subsidiary of iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). Due to management s
intent to merge iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) and iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida) at a later date $34,980 paid by iHealthcare,
Inc. (Florida) was accounted for in Paid in Capital of iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). This was based on a conclusion that iHealthcare,
Inc. (formerly Opulent) would not qualify as a business under ASC 805 due to iHealthcare, Inc. s (formerly Opulent) lack
of assets, operations, inputs or processes at the acquisition date. The use of Fair Value and purchase accounting did not appear
appropriate considering the aforementioned facts and management s intent to merge the entities. Management took a view at
the acquisition date towards 805-50 and the eventual use of the rules covering a merger of entities under common control. 

On January 14, 2016 iHealthcare, Inc.,
a Florida Company, became the controlling shareholder of Opulent Acquisition, Inc. At the time of the sale of Opulent Acquisition,
Inc. Mr. Mijares owned 62.5% and Mr. Bingaman owned 37.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida
Company. 

On January 14, 2016, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio
resigned as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of Opulent Acquisition,
Inc. 

On January 14, 2016, Mr. Noel Mijares
was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and President. 

On January 14, 2016, Mr. David A. Bingaman
was appointed as Chief Operating Officer, Vice President, and Secretary. 

On April 22, 2016 we, Opulent Acquisition,
Inc. ( iHealthcare, Inc.-Delaware ) entered into and consummated a merger with iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company
( iHealthcare, Inc.-Florida ). iHealthcare, Inc.-Delaware is the Surviving Corporation as result of the merger. The
officers and directors of Opulent Acquisition, Inc., now known as iHealthcare, Inc., remained the same and unchanged. 

On April 22, 2016, iHealthcare, Inc.
(formerly Opulent) and iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida) were under common control. iHealthcare, Inc. (formerly Opulent) was 100% owned
by iHealthcare, Inc. (Florida). Due to the parent subsidiary relationship on April 22, 2016, under ASC 805-50, the transaction
is being accounted for similar to a pooling of interests with carryover basis being used and go forward reporting will have the
entities combined from the first day of the first period presented. 

On April 22, 2016, the Company filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation, changing its name to iHealthcare,
Inc. 

Previous to the Merger Noel Mijares
owned 6,250 shares of common stock of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company and David A Bingaman owned 3,750 shares of common
stock of iHealthcare, Inc., the Florida Company. After the merger each one of these shares were converted into 100 shares of our
common stock (iHealthcare, Inc., a Delaware Company, formerly known as Opulent Acquisition, Inc). The 20,000,000 shares of common
stock owned by iHealthcare, Inc., a Florida Company of iHealthcare, Inc., formerly known as Opulent Acquisition Inc., a Delaware
Company were cancelled upon consummation of the merger. All share amounts are adjusted retroactively. 

Currently, Noel Mijares owns 625,000
shares of our common stock and David A Bingaman owns 375,000 shares of our common stock. 

The total number of authorized shares
of stock that the Company is authorized to issue is 150,000,000, consisting of 143,500,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par
value per share, and 6,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share. 

On May 13, 2016 David A. Bingaman was
appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Director. 

On July 25, 2016 we, Ihealthcare,
Inc., organized Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company. 

On August 2, 2016 we, Ihealthcare,
Inc. transferred 50% of the membership interests in Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC to All in 1 Medical, LLC per the terms
of the Joint Venture agreement stated below. 

Each of the aforementioned parties own 50% of the membership interests
in Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC. All in 1 Medical, LLC is owned and operated by Mark Heffner, who is a non-affiliate  of
Ihealthcare, Inc. 

As of August 31, 2016 Ihealthcare
Surgical, LLC has not had any monetary transactions. 

On August 19, 2016   Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC, entered
into and consummated a joint venture agreement with All In 1 Medical, LLC. The purpose of the joint venture agreement is to
forge a relationship that through,  to be determined means, will bring together both parties in an effort to sell, to be
determined, medical products. Each party retains a 50% interest in the joint venture. Each party has also agreed to split
profits and expenses equally that relate to the joint venture. The term of the joint venture agreement is through August 4,
2026. It may be renewed however, for an additional five year term if agreed upon by both parties. Each party of the joint
venture agreement has agreed to contribute $500 for business purposes set forth in the joint venture agreement. Neither party
has, as of the date of this report, contributed the $500 however, both parties intend to make such contribution after a joint
bank account is opened up for the purpose of the joint venture. 

Per the above the Company has applied ASC 323
for presentation and disclosure requirements. Because Ihealthcare Surgical, LLC conducted no monetary business as of August
31, 2016 there were no transactions recorded on the books for this period.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principals of Consolidation  

These financial statements include the accounts of the Company s
wholly owned subsidiary iHealthcare, all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2015 and notes thereto. 

The results of operations for the nine
month period ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year.  

Inventories  

Inventories, consisting of products
available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, and are valued at the lower of
cost or market value. This valuation requires Ihealthcare, Inc. to make judgments, based on currently-available
information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product
vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue
realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

Note 3
 - Going Concern   

The Company s unaudited consolidated
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to
a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions
that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of
these financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital
deficiency, negative cash flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios. 

The Company has not established any
source of revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to
capital. There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Note 4 -
Related-Party Transactions   

Due to related party   

Pharma Tropical, which is
controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, loaned the Company $500 during the year for payment of Company expenses which
was considered forgiven and converted to contributed capital as an addition to APIC.  

Unisource Discovery, Inc., is a related party and is controlled
by our Chief Executive Officer, Noel Mijares. During the period Unisource Discovery Inc. advanced the Company $6,015 and the Company
made payment of $3,805 on these advances which are noninterest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand. The total due to the Unisource
Discovery Inc. as of August 31, 2016 is $2,210. 

During the nine month period ending August 31,
2016, the Company borrowed $15,775 from  the Chief Executive Officer to pay for expenses on behalf of the company in the
current year. $7,500 of the money borrowed, in addition to previous payments, were posted as a reduction to the subscription
receivable owed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company 

As of August 31, 2016, the Company was indebted to the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company in the amount of $8,275 which is noninterest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand. 

Additional paid in capital   

As a result of the merger a subscription receivable was contributed by the principal shareholders in the amount
$34,800. The Company has collected $21,980 from the subscription receivable and reduced the subscription receivable by $7,500 against
the loan owed by the Company to the CEO. As of August 31, 2016 the subscription receivable balance is $5,500 due by the CFO to

or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.  

The
assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of
future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances.
As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions
from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the
outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability
of those forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements
specified in the following information are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be
important at the time the financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements.  

While
we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.
