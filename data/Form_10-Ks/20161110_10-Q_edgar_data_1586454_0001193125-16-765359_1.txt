   Prime Meridian Holding Company ( PMHG ) owns 100% of the outstanding
common stock of Prime Meridian Bank (the  Bank ) (collectively the  Company ). PMHG s primary activity is the operation of the Bank. The Bank is a Florida state-chartered commercial bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank are
insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Bank offers a variety of community banking services to individual and corporate clients through its three banking offices located in Tallahassee
and Crawfordville, Florida and its online banking platform.    In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments (consisting principally of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2016, and the results of operations for the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year.      Comprehensive Income.   Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in earnings. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are reported
as a separate component of the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, such items along with net earnings, are components of comprehensive income. The only component of other comprehensive income (loss) is the net change in the
unrealized gains on the securities available for sale.      Stock-Based Compensation.   The Company expenses the fair value of any
stock options granted. The Company recognizes stock option compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings as the options vest.  
   Mortgage Banking Revenue.   Mortgage banking revenue includes gains on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale and wholesale
brokerage fees. The Company recognizes mortgage banking revenue from mortgage loans originated in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings upon sale of the loans.  
   Recent Accounting Standards Update.   In June 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by the Company. The ASU requires the Company to measure all
expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted,
although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The Company will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for its circumstances.

  The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users
better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements
that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.
The ASU will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2018.

  Securities with gross unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time
that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, are as follows (in thousands):      
   The unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 on ten securities were caused by market conditions. It is
expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value of the investments. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to market conditions and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and
intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. Securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in
thousands):      
   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no securities were transferred in or out of

  Loans, Continued         
  The Company has divided the loan portfolio into three portfolio segments and five portfolio
classes, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. All loans are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The Company identifies the portfolio
segments and classes as follows:      Real Estate Mortgage Loans.   Real estate mortgage loans are typically divided into three
classes: commercial, residential and home equity and construction loans.      Commercial.   Loans of this type are typically our
more complex loans. This category of real estate loans is comprised of loans secured by mortgages on commercial property that are typically owner-occupied, but also includes non-owner occupied investment properties. Commercial loans that are secured
by owner-occupied commercial real estate are repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower. The maturity for this type of loan is generally limited to three to five years; however, payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis.
Typically, interest rates on our commercial real estate loans are fixed for five years or less after which they adjust based upon a predetermined spread over a market index rate. At times, a rate may be fixed for longer than five years. As part of
our credit underwriting standards, the Company typically requires personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners  personal financial statements and tax returns. As part of the
enterprise risk management process, it is understood that risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values, the overall strength of the borrower and the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy
rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrowers  management. In order to mitigate and limit these risks, we analyze the borrowers  cash flows and evaluate collateral value. Currently, the collateral securing our
commercial real estate loans includes a variety of property types, such as office, warehouse, and retail facilities. Other types include multifamily properties, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial properties. Generally, commercial real
estate loans present a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate loan portfolio.      Residential and Home Equity.   The
Company offers first and second one-to-four family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit; the collateral for these loans is generally the clients  owner-occupied residences. Although these types of loans present lower levels of risk
than commercial real estate loans, risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrowers  financial condition. The nonowner-occupied investment
properties are more similar in risk to commercial real estate loans, and therefore, are underwritten by assessing the property s income potential and appraised value. In both cases, we underwrite the borrower s financial condition and
evaluate his or her global cash flow position. Borrowers may be affected by numerous factors, including job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. As part of our product mix, the Bank offers both portfolio and secondary market mortgages;
portfolio loans generally are based on a 1-year, 3-year or 5-year adjustable rate mortgage; while 15-year or 30-year fixed-rate loans are generally sold in the secondary market.

  Loans, Continued         
    Construction.   Typically, these loans have a construction period of one to two
years and the interest is paid monthly. Once the construction period terminates, some of these loans convert to a term loan with a maturity of one to five years. This portion of our loan portfolio includes loans to small and midsized businesses to
construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties, and residential developments. This type of loan is also made to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market area. An
independent appraisal is used to determine the value of the collateral and confirm that the ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral will not exceed policies of the Bank. As the construction project progresses, loan proceeds are
requested by the borrower to complete phases of construction and funding is only disbursed after the project has been inspected by a third-party inspector or experienced construction lender. Risks associated with construction loans include
fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk, and changes in market trends. The ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project is another risk factor that also
may be affected by changes in market trends since the initial funding of the loan.      Commercial Loans.   The Bank offers a wide
range of commercial loans, including business term loans, equipment financing, lines of credit, and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to small and midsized businesses. Small-to-medium sized businesses, retail, and professional
establishments make up our target market for commercial loans. Our Relationship Managers primarily underwrite these loans based on the borrower s ability to service the loan from cash flow. Lines of credit and loans secured by accounts
receivable and/or inventory are monitored periodically by our staff. Loans secured by  all business assets,  or a  blanket lien  are typically only made to highly qualified borrowers due to the nonspecific nature of the
collateral. Valuation of business collateral is generally supported by an appraisal, purchase order, or third party physical inspection. Personal guarantees of the principals of business borrowers are usually required. Equipment loans generally have
a term of five years or less and may have a fixed or variable rate; we use conservative margins when pricing these loans. Working capital loans generally do not exceed one year and typically, they are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and
personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The Bank currently offers both SBA 504 and SBA 7A loans. SBA 504 loans provide financing for major fixed assets such as real estate and equipment while SBA 7A loans are generally used to
establish a new business or assist in the acquisition, operation, or expansion of an existing business. With both SBA loan programs, there are set eligibility requirements and underwriting standards outlined by SBA that can change as the government
alters its fiscal policy. Significant factors affecting a commercial borrower s creditworthiness include the quality of management and the ability both to evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting the business 
markets for products and services and to respond effectively to such changes. These loans may be made unsecured or secured, but most are made on a secured basis. Risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include local, regional, and
national market conditions. Other factors of risk could include changes in the borrower s management and fluctuations in collateral value.

  Loans, Continued         
  Additionally, there may be refinancing risk if a commercial loan includes a balloon payment
which must be refinanced or paid off at loan maturity. In reference to our risk management process, our commercial loan portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Therefore, we require that
all loans to businesses must have a clearly stated and reasonable payment plan to allow for timely retirement of debt, unless secured by liquid collateral or as otherwise justified.  
   Consumer and Other Loans.   These loans are made for various consumer purposes, such as the financing of automobiles, boats, and
recreational vehicles. The payment structure of these loans is normally on an installment basis. The risk associated with this category of loans stems from the reduced collateral value for a defaulted loan; the collateral may not provide an adequate
source of repayment of the principal. The underwriting on these loans is primarily based on the borrower s financial condition. In many cases, these are unsecured credits that subject us to risk when the borrower s financial condition
declines or deteriorates. Based upon our current trend in consumer loans, management does not anticipate consumer loans will become a substantial component of our loan portfolio at any time in the foreseeable future. Consumer loans are made at fixed
and variable interest rates and are based on the appropriate amortization for the asset and purpose.    The following summarizes the loan
credit quality (in thousands):      
   The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers
to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.

  Loans, Continued         
  The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. Loans
classified as substandard or special mention are reviewed quarterly by the Company for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified and whether there is any impairment. All loans are graded upon initial
issuance. Furthermore, construction loans, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and commercial loan relationships in excess of $500,000 are reviewed at least annually. The Company determines the appropriate loan grade during the renewal
process and reevaluates the loan grade in situations when a loan becomes past due.    Loans excluded from the review process above are
generally classified as pass credits until: (a) they become past due; (b) management becomes aware of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower; or (c) the client contacts the Company for a modification. In these
circumstances, the loan is specifically evaluated for potential classification as to special mention, substandard or even charged-off. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  
  Pass    A Pass loan s primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if
necessary.     Special Mention    A Special Mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.
If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company s credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose
an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.     Substandard    A Substandard loan is inadequately
protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by
the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.     Doubtful    A loan
classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly
questionable and improbable.     Loss    A loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that
continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily preclude the potential for recovery, but rather signifies it is no longer practical to defer writing off the asset.  
 At September 30, 2016, there were six loans on nonaccrual.

  Regulatory Capital       Banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the
Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Until a bank holding company s assets reach $1 billion, the risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve are applied to bank holding companies on a nonconsolidated basis, unless the bank
holding company is engaged in nonbank activities involving significant leverage, or it has a significant amount of outstanding debt held by the general public. Instead, a bank holding company with less than $1 billion in assets generally applies the
risk-based capital and leverage capital guidelines on a bank-only basis and must only meet a debt-to-equity ratio at the holding company level. The FDIC risk-based capital guidelines apply directly to insured state banks, regardless of whether they
are subsidiaries of a bank holding company. Both agencies  requirements, which are substantially similar, establish minimum capital ratios in relation to assets, both on an aggregate basis as adjusted for credit risks and off-balance sheet
exposures. The risk weights assigned to assets are based primarily on credit risks.

  Regulatory Capital, Continued         
  A particular asset is assigned to a risk category depending upon its severity of risk. Under
the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, risk weights (from 0% to 1,250%) are applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily
based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The assignment of risk weightings to certain assets are also subject to qualitative judgments by our regulators.  
 Capital is then classified into three categories, Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
( CET1 ) is the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and qualifying minority interests, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions that include Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ). Mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and investments in financial institutions are limited to an aggregate of 15% of CET1 and 10% of CET1 individually. Additional Tier 1 Capital includes
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests, grandfathered trust preferred securities, and Troubled Asset Relief Program instruments, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 2 Capital includes subordinated
debt and preferred stock, total capital minority interests not included in Tier 1, and ALLL not exceeding 1.25% percent of risk-weighted assets, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.  
 The Bank is also subject to the Basel III capital level threshold requirements under the FDIC s Prompt Corrective Action regulations.
These regulations are intended to ensure that banks maintain strong capital positions even in the event of severe economic downturns or unforeseen losses.  
 Changes that could affect the Bank going forward include additional constraints on the inclusion of deferred tax assets in capital and
increased risk weightings for nonperforming loans and acquisition/development loans in regulatory capital. Under those regulations, the Company elected an irreversible one-time opt-out to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital in the first quarter of
2015.

  Stock Option Plans       The 2015 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2015
Plan ) was approved by the Shareholders at PMHG s annual meeting of shareholders on May 20, 2015 and permits PMHG to grant the Company s key employees and directors stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares,
and phantom stock. Under the 2015 Plan, the amount of shares which may be issued is 500,000, but in no instance more than 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of PMHG s common stock. As of September 30, 2016, no stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, or phantom stock shares have been issued under the 2015 Plan. As of May 20, 2015, no further grants will be made under the 2007 Stock Option Plan (the  2007 Plan ). Unexercised stock options
that were granted under the 2007 Plan will remain outstanding and will expire under the terms of the individual stock grant.    A summary of
the activity in PMHG s 2007 Stock Option Plan is as follows:      
   At September 30, 2016, there was $1,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2007 Plan. The fair value of the options granted is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of fourteen months. The fair value of shares vested and recognized as compensation
expense was $1,000 and $12,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  Federal Home Loan Bank Advances       Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances are
collateralized by a blanket lien on qualifying residential real estate, commercial real estate, home equity lines of credit and multi-family loans. Under this blanket lien, the Company could borrow up to $36.4 million at September 30, 2016. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding loans under this line.

lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and guaranteed accounts and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and  interest-rate  risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these financial instruments.

  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments, continued         
  The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party
to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit, construction loans in process, unused lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and guaranteed accounts is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses
the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for   on-balance-sheet   instruments. Commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit are agreements to
lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed-expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.    The
Company evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a   case-by-case   basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of
credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. These letters of credit are
primarily issued to support third-party borrowing arrangements and generally have expiration dates within one year of issuance. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to
clients. In the event the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is
represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Some of the Bank s standby letters of credit are secured by collateral and those letters of credit
totaled $406,000 at September 30, 2016.    Guaranteed accounts are irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by us to guarantee a
client s credit line with our third party credit card company, Card Assets, and its issuing bank, First Arkansas Bank   Trust. As a part of this agreement, we are responsible for the established credit limit on certain accounts plus
10%.    The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the dollar amount disclosed in the
table below. Standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit typically result in loans with a market interest rate when funded. A summary of the contractual amounts of the Company s financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
at September 30, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):

 Prime Meridian Holding Company ( PMHG ) was incorporated as a Florida corporation on May 25, 2010, and is the one-bank holding
company for, and sole shareholder of, Prime Meridian Bank (the  Bank ) (collectively, the  Company ). The Bank opened for business on February 4, 2008, and was acquired by PMHG on September 16, 2010. PMHG has no
significant operations other than owning the stock of the Bank. The Bank offers a broad array of commercial and retail banking services through three full-service offices located in Tallahassee and Crawfordville, Florida and through its online
banking platform.    As a one bank holding company, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments. Our primary
source of funding for our loans is deposits. Our largest expenses are interest on those deposits and salaries and employee benefits. We measure our performance through our net interest margin, return on average assets, and return on average equity,
while maintaining appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.    The following table shows selected information for the
periods ended or at the dates indicated:      
     
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES     Our critical accounting policies which involve significant judgements and assumptions that have a material impact on the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, and used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016, have remained unchanged from the disclosures presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   FINANCIAL CONDITION   
 Average assets totaled $281.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $48.6 million, or 20.9%, over the
three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, average assets totaled $268.5 million, compared to $223.5 million over the same period in 2015, a $45.0 million, or 20.1% increase. In both time period
comparisons, the increase in 2016 can be primarily attributed to higher average loan balances, partially offset by lower average balances of securities.  
   Investment Securities.   Our primary objective in managing our investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality,
highly liquid investments yielding competitive returns. We use the investment securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, to generate interest and dividend income, to provide
liquidity to meet funding requirements, and to provide collateral for pledging of public funds. At September 30, 2016, our available for sale investment portfolio included U.S. Treasury notes, municipal securities, and mortgage-backed
securities and had a fair market value of $32.7 million and an amortized cost value of $32.1 million. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 11.3% and 15.6% of our total
assets, respectively. The average yield on our investment securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 1.98%, compared to 2.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Loans.   Our primary earning asset is our loan portfolio and our primary source of income is the interest earned on the loan
portfolio. Our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans, construction loans, and commercial loans made to small-to-medium sized companies and their owners, as well as residential real estate loans, including first and second
mortgages, and consumer loans. Our goal is to maintain a high quality of loans through sound underwriting and lending practices. We work diligently to attract new lending clients through direct solicitation by our loan officers, utilizing
relationship networks from existing clients, competitive pricing, and innovative structure. Our loans are priced based upon the degree of risk, collateral, loan amount, and maturity. We have no loans to foreign borrowers.  
 Loans grew $9.3 million, or 4.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016, and have grown $35.7 million, or 19.1% from December 31,
2015. While the Bank has grown all loan sectors in 2016, nearly half of the year-to-date growth came from the residential and home equity sector, which is up $16.9 million from year-end. In total, approximately 77.1% of the total loan portfolio was
collateralized by commercial and residential real estate mortgages at September 30, 2016, compared to 76.7% at year-end.  
   Nonperforming assets.   We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due, unless they are
well secured and in the process of collection. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest
previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed from income.    Accounting standards require the Bank to identify loans as impaired loans
when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. These standards require that
impaired loans be valued at the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, using one of the following methods: the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We implement these standards in our monthly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, and identify and value impaired loans in accordance with regulatory
 
      27

guidance on these standards. Six loans totaling $1,161,000 were deemed to be impaired under the Bank s policy at September 30, 2016, compared to three loans totaling $144,000 at
December 31, 2015. The Bank s nonperforming assets represented 0.40% of total assets at September 30, 2016, compared to 0.06% at December 31, 2015.  
   Allowance for Loan Losses.   Management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb
probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses, which
was $2.9 million or 1.27% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Of the $1.2 million in impaired loans at September 30, 2016, $77,000 of these loans had a reserve of $65,000
allocated in the allowance. Collateral values on the remaining impaired loans did not require specific reserves at September 30, 2016. Comparatively, of the $144,000 in impaired loans at December 31, 2015, there was a $69,000 reserve allocated
on the full amount.      Deposits .  Deposits are the major source of the Bank s funds for lending and other investment
purposes. Total deposits at September 30, 2016 were $261.2 million, an increase of $43.6 million, or 20.0%, from December 31, 2015. Year-to-date deposit growth in 2016 is spread fairly evenly between noninterest-bearing and
interest-bearing accounts. The average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits accounted for 23.7% of the average balance of total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 23.4% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.      Borrowings.   The Bank has an agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta
( FHLB ) and pledges its qualified loans as collateral which would allow the Bank, as of September 30, 2016, to borrow up to $36.4 million. In addition, the Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks that
totaled $16.3 million at September 30, 2016. There were no loans outstanding under any of these lines at September 30, 2016.     RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS     Net interest income constitutes the principal source of income for the Bank and results from the excess of interest income
on interest-earning assets over interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The principal interest-earning assets are investment securities and loans receivable. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits, interest-bearing
checking accounts, savings deposits, money-market accounts, and other borrowings. Funds attracted by these interest-bearing liabilities are invested in interest-earning assets. Accordingly, net interest income depends upon the volume of average
interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities as well as the interest rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. The following tables set forth information regarding: (i) the total dollar amount of interest and
dividend income of the Bank from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average costs; (iii) net interest income;
(iv) interest-rate spread; (v) net interest margin; and (vi) weighted-average yields and rates. Yields and costs were derived by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities. The yields and
costs depicted in the table include the amortization of fees, which are considered to constitute adjustments to yields.    As shown in the
following two tables, the 25.1% increase in average loan balances for the three month period and the 25.0% increase in average loan balances for the nine-month period were not enough to offset the decrease in the average yield on loans from 2015 to
2016. This combined with lower yields on securities led to a decline in the average yield on total interest-earning assets, interest-rate spread, and net interest margin for both the 2016 third quarter and nine month period.

   Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   Net Earnings.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net earnings of $610,000, or $0.31 per
basic and diluted share, compared to net earnings of $378,000, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Net Interest Income.   Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest
and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income was $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.      Interest Income.   Interest income
increased to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a $397,000 or 16.8%, increase over the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was driven by an increase in average loans from $175.6 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $219.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.      Interest Expense.  
Interest expense was $206,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $183,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The year-over-year increase resulted primarily from a 22.0%, or $33.8 million, increase in the
average balance of interest-bearing deposits from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016.    Despite strong growth in the
loan portfolio, the Company s net interest margin declined 12 basis points to 3.76%, due primarily to new loans being originated at lower yields.  
   Provision for Loan Losses.   The provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to increase the total loan loss allowance to a
level deemed appropriate by management. The provision is based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the Bank, industry standards, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market area, and other factors related to
the collectability of the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $108,000, compared to $124,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Management believes that the allowance for loan losses, which was $2.9 million or 1.27% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, is
adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the
allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of the established allowance for loan losses,
or that any increased allowance for loan losses that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by
bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in additions to our provision for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.  
   Noninterest income.   Noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities,
primarily service charges and fees on deposit accounts, mortgage banking revenue, income from bank-owned life insurance and any gains on the sale of securities available for sale. Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016
totaled $415,000 an increase of $125,000, or 43.1%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by a 32.7%, or $64,000, increase in mortgage banking revenue. Increased service charges and fees on deposit
accounts and gains in other income from higher merchant card services and credit card fee income also contributed to growth in noninterest income for the 2016 quarter.  
      31  

Table of Contents  

    Noninterest expense.   Noninterest expense increased $161,000 or 9.2%, to $1.9
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. The majority of the increase occurred in overall bank salaries and employee benefits as full-time equivalent employees increased from 54 at
September 30, 2015 to 63 at September 30, 2016. Higher board fees and contracted services also contributed to higher noninterest expense year over year.  
   Income Taxes.   Income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of earnings after adjustments for nontaxable
income and nondeductible expenses, and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Income tax expense was $335,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to income tax expense of $213,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The higher provision relates to earnings before income taxes of $945,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to earnings before income taxes of $591,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.     Comparison of
Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       Net Earnings.   For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company reported net earnings of $1,574,000, or $0.79 per basic and diluted share, compared to net earnings of $1,203,000, or $0.62 per basic and $0.61 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30,
2015.      Net Interest Income.   Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference
between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income was $7.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Interest Income.  
Interest income increased to $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $1.1 million or 15.9%, increase over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was driven by an increase in average loans from $165.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $206.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Interest Expense.   Interest expense was $599,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $525,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The year-over-year increase resulted primarily from a 23.2%, or $34.6 million, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits from the first nine months of 2015 to the first nine months of
2016.    Despite strong growth in the loan portfolio, the Company s net interest margin declined 14 basis points to 3.76%, due
primarily to new loans being originated at lower yields.      Provision for Loan Losses.   The provision for loan losses is
charged to earnings to increase the total loan loss allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management. The provision is based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the Bank, industry standards, general economic conditions,
particularly as they relate to our market area, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $412,000 compared to $333,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.

    Noninterest income.   Noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad
range of financial services and activities, primarily service charges and fees on deposit accounts, mortgage banking revenue, income from bank-owned life insurance, and any gain on the sale of securities available for sale. Noninterest income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1.2 million an increase of $430,000 or 59.2%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to a $230,000, or 56.5%, increase in mortgage banking revenue.
Other contributing factors include higher service charges and fees on deposit accounts, a $60,000 increase in the gain on sale of securities available for sale, and a $76,000 increase in other income which was driven by higher merchant card services
and credit card fee income.      Noninterest expense.   Noninterest expense increased $790,000, or 16.4%, to $5.6 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period a year ago. With the exception of professional fees, noninterest expense was up across all categories, partially due to the opening of our Crawfordville office in September, 2015,
and the expansion of our team. The majority of the increase in noninterest expense occurred in salaries and employee benefits as full-time equivalent employees increased from 54 at September 30, 2015 to 63 at September 30, 2016. Other
major contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were higher board fees and higher contracted services in 2016.      Income
Taxes .  Income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of earnings, after adjustments for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses, and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the
recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Income tax expense was $861,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to income tax expense of $663,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The higher provision relates to higher earnings before taxes for the period.     LIQUIDITY   
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal
course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company s clients, as well as meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily.  
 Our liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and investment securities, funds
provided by operations, and capital. Additionally as a commercial bank, we are expected to maintain an adequate liquidity reserve. The liquidity reserve may consist of cash on hand, cash on demand deposit with correspondent banks, federal funds
sold, and marketable securities such as United States government agency securities, municipal securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Our primary liquid assets accounted for 19.2% and 19.1% of total assets at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.    The Bank also has external sources of funds through the FHLB, unsecured lines of credit with
correspondent banks, and the State of Florida s Qualified Public Deposit Program ( QPD ). At September 30, 2016, the Bank had access to approximately $36.4 million of available lines of credit secured by qualifying collateral
with the FHLB, in addition to $16.3 million in unsecured lines of credit maintained with correspondent banks. As of September 30, 2016, we had no borrowings under any of these lines. Furthermore, some of our securities are pledged to
collateralize certain deposits through our participation in the State of Florida s QPD program. The market value of securities pledged to the QPD program was $9.6 million at September 30, 2016.  
      33

  Our core deposits consist of noninterest bearing accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts,
time deposits and savings accounts. We closely monitor our level of certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 and large deposits. At September 30, 2016, total deposits were $261.2 million, of which $16.1 million was in certificates of
deposits of $100,000 or more. We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan ( CFP ) that identifies liquidity needs and weighs alternate courses of action designed to address those needs in emergency situations. We perform a quarterly cash flow
analysis and stress test the CFP to evaluate the expected funding needs and funding capacity during a liquidity stress event. We believe that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably immediate short-term and
intermediate-term demands and do not know of any trends, events, or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse effect on our liquidity position.  
  CAPITAL RESOURCES     Stockholders 
equity was $26.8 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $24.9 million at December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors declared and PMHG paid its first annual dividend of $0.05 per share of common
stock. At September 30, 2016, the Bank was considered to be  well capitalized  under the FDIC s Prompt Corrective Action regulations with a 9.01% Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio, a 11.55% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital
Ratio, a 11.55% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, and a 12.80% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, all above the minimum ratios to be considered  well capitalized.   
 The following is a summary at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of the regulatory capital requirements to be  well
capitalized  and the Bank s capital position (dollars in thousands).      
 
      34  

Table of Contents  

  The Bank is also subject to the following capital level threshold requirements under the FDIC s Prompt
Corrective Action regulations.      
   Until such time as PMHG has $1 billion in total consolidated assets, it will not be subject to any
consolidated capital requirements.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 Refer to Note 9 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q for the period ending
September 30, 2016 for a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements.       Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     Not applicable.  
    Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 We maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that PMHG files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon management s evaluation of those controls
and procedures performed within the 90 days preceding the filing of this Report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, subject to the limitations noted below, the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by PMHG in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  
 We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and to
improve the Company s controls and procedures over time  
      35  

Table of Contents  

and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and nonfinancial information
concerning the Company s business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and
procedures.      (b) Changes in Internal Controls    
 We have made no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that
have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.      (c) Limitations on the
Effectiveness of Controls      Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

     PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 From time to time, we are a party to various matters incidental to the conduct of a banking business. Presently, we believe that we are not a
party to any legal proceedings in which resolution would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows, or capital levels.  
    Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 While the Company attempts to identify, manage, and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with its business to the extent practical under
the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These
risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds     On October 15, 2016, PMHG issued 1,071 shares to members of its Board of Directors in lieu of $13,575 in cash fees.
During the third quarter, PMHG issued 4,200 shares to directors who exercised stock options and paid $42,000 upon such exercises. The shares were issued in accordance with the intrastate exemption from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(11)
of the Securities Act of 1933, because the Company is doing business within the State of Florida and each acquirer and offeree of securities resides within the State of Florida.

 CHARTER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

Charter of the Compensation Committee 

Exhibit 99.2   
  PRIME MERIDIAN HOLDING COMPANY   
  COMPENSATION      COMMITTEE
CHARTER      As Amended 03/17/2016   
  and 07/21/2016      I. PREFACE   
 The Board of Directors of Prime Meridian Holding Company ( Company ) has created a Compensation Committee ( Committee ),
and has adopted this Compensation Committee Charter ( Charter ) on this 20 th  day of March, 2014.  
  II. PURPOSE     The purpose of the Committee
is to act on behalf of and with the concurrence of the entire Board with respect to the compensation of the Company s executive officers, and relating to the Company s compensation and personnel policies and programs, including management
development and succession plans.     III. MEMBERSHIP   
 The Committee shall be appointed by the Board and shall be comprised of three or more Directors, all but one of whom must meet the independence
requirements under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (i.e. non-employee outside directors who are free from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment).  
  IV. RESPONSIBILITIES     The Committee shall
have the following duties and responsibilities:      

Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, evaluate the performance of the Chief Executive Officer in light of those goals and objectives, and
determine and approve the compensation level of the Chief Executive Officer based on this evaluation.        

Review corporate goals and objectives relevant to the cash compensation for other executive officers, evaluate the performance of those executive officers in light of those goals and objectives, and review the cash
compensation level of those executive officers based on this evaluation.        

In determining the long-term, stock-based incentive compensation component of executive compensation, the Committee shall consider the Company s performance and relative shareholder return, the value of similar
incentive awards to executive officers in comparable positions at comparable financial institutions, and awards given to Company executive officers in past years.    
      1  

Review and recommend to the Board employment agreements, severance agreements, and change in control agreements for senior officers of the Company.    

Administer incentive compensation plans, equity based plans, and other compensation plans that are established or maintained by the Company from time to time.    

Make recommendations to the Board with respect to the adoption, amendment, termination, or replacement of compensation plans and policies.    

Recommend to Board the compensation for Board members, such as director fees, stock options, and other means of compensation, as appropriate, and pursuant to the Company s compensation guidelines.

Review and discuss the  Compensation Discussion and Analysis  disclosure with management when applicable, recommend its inclusion in the Company s annual proxy statement, if applicable, and prepare a
report for inclusion in such proxy statement, if applicable.        

Align the Company s compensation policies with a view on the Company s long- term interests, and avoid short-term rewards for management decisions that could pose undue long-term risks for the Company.
     In fulfilling these duties and responsibilities, the Committee shall have full access to the Company s books, records,
facilities, personnel, and outside consultants as needed.     V. AUTHORITY   
 The Board has delegated to the Committee all powers and authority that are necessary or appropriate in order for the Committee to fulfill its
duties and obligations, including the following:
