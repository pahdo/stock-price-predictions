  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

A. 
    Financial Statements 
       
  Organization 
    
  EQM is a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership. EQT Midstream Services, LLC (EQM General Partner), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP), is the general partner of EQM. References in these consolidated financial statements to EQT refer collectively to EQT Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, the owners of a   90.1%   limited partner interest and   100%   non-economic general partner interest in EQGP. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of EQM as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of its operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and its cash flows and partners' capital for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
    
  NWV Gathering was a business and the NWV Gathering Acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control; therefore, EQM recorded the assets and liabilities of NWV Gathering at their carrying amounts to EQT on the date of the transaction. The difference between EQT s net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to EQT was recorded as a capital transaction with EQT, which resulted in a reduction in partners  capital. EQM recast its consolidated financial statements to retrospectively reflect the NWV Gathering Acquisition as if the business was owned for all periods presented; however, the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if EQM had owned it during the periods reported. 
    
  Due to the seasonal nature of EQM s utility customer contracts, the interim statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in EQM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as well as  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained therein. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP when it becomes effective and is required to be adopted using one of two retrospective application methods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date   which approved a one year deferral of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application of these ASUs is permitted as of the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. EQM expects to adopt the ASUs using the modified retrospective method of adoption on January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation  . The standard changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. EQM adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016 which had no significant impact on reported results or disclosures.

     Table of Contents  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The changes primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This standard will eliminate the cost method of accounting for equity investments. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption of certain provisions permitted.   EQM is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The ASU requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. EQM is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this ASU eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. EQM is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This ASU addresses the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues.  The amendments in the ASU will be effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. EQM does not anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.

    Acquisitions 
       
  NWV Gathering Acquisition 
    
  On March 17, 2015, EQT contributed NWV Gathering to EQM Gathering. EQM paid total consideration of approximately   $925.7 million   to EQT, consisting of approximately   $873.2 million   in cash,   511,973   EQM common units and   178,816   EQM general partner units. 
    
  MVP Interest Acquisition 
    
  On March 30, 2015, EQM assumed from EQT   100%   of the membership interests in MVP Holdco, the owner of the MVP Interest in the MVP Joint Venture, for approximately   $54.2 million  . The cash payment represented EQM's reimbursement to EQT for   100%   of the capital contributions made by EQT to the MVP Joint Venture as of March 30, 2015. See Note F. 
    
  Preferred Interest Acquisition 
    
  On April 15, 2015, pursuant to the NWV Gathering Acquisition contribution and sale agreement, EQM acquired the Preferred Interest in EES from EQT for approximately   $124.3 million  . EES generates revenue from services provided to a local distribution company. See Note F.

    Partners' Capital and Net Income per Limited Partner Unit 
       
  The following table summarizes EQM's common, subordinated and general partner units issued from January 1,   2015   through   September 30, 2016  . 

In February 2016, EQM issued   19,796   common units under the 2014 EQM Value Driver Award (2014 EQM VDA) and   92,472   common units under the EQM Total Return Program, which were compensation programs for EQT employees performing work for EQM. The awards were granted in January 2014 and July 2012, respectively. 
    
  During the second quarter of   2016  , EQM issued   2,949,309   common units at an average price per unit of   $74.42   under the   $750 million   ATM Program. EQM received net proceeds of approximately   $217.1 million   after deducting commissions of approximately   $2.2 million   and other offering expenses of approximately   $0.2 million  . EQM used the net proceeds for general partnership purposes. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQGP and its subsidiaries owned   21,811,643   EQM common units, representing a   26.6%   limited partner interest,   1,443,015   EQM general partner units, representing a   1.8%   general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights in EQM. As of   September 30, 2016  , EQT owned   100%   of the non-economic general partner interest and a   90.1%   limited partner interest in EQGP. 
    
  Net Income per Limited Partner Unit 
    
  Net income attributable to NWV Gathering for periods prior to March 17, 2015 was not allocated to the limited partners for purposes of calculating net income per limited partner unit. The weighted average phantom unit awards included in the calculation of basic weighted average limited partner units outstanding was   17,481   and   14,233   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   17,046   and   13,906   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Potentially dilutive securities included in the calculation of diluted weighted average limited partner units outstanding totaled   zero   and   157,386   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   27,397   and   160,043   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    Related Party Transactions 
       
  In the ordinary course of business, EQM has transactions with EQT and its affiliates including, but not limited to, transportation service and precedent agreements, storage agreements and gas gathering agreements.     Pursuant to an omnibus agreement, EQT performs centralized corporate, general and administrative services for EQM. In exchange, EQM reimburses EQT for the expenses incurred in providing these services, including direct and indirect costs and expenses attributable to EQT's long-term incentive programs.     Pursuant to an operation and management services agreement, EQT Gathering, LLC (EQT Gathering), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, provides EQM s pipelines and storage facilities with certain operational and management services.  EQM reimburses EQT Gathering for such services pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement. The expenses for which EQM reimburses EQT and its subsidiaries may not necessarily reflect the actual expenses that EQM would incur on a stand-alone basis and EQM is unable to estimate what those expenses would be on a stand-alone basis. See also Note B, Note C, Note F, Note G and Note K for further discussion of related party transactions. 
    
  EQT terminated the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees (the Retirement Plan) effective December 31, 2014. On March 2, 2016, the IRS issued a favorable determination letter for the termination of the Retirement Plan. On June 28, 2016, EQT purchased annuities from and transferred the Retirement Plan assets and liabilities to American General Life Insurance Company. In the third quarter of 2016, EQM reimbursed EQT approximately   $5.2 million   for its proportionate share of such funding related to retirees of Equitrans, L.P. (Equitrans), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQM and the owner of EQM's  FERC-regulated transmission, storage and gathering system. The settlement charge is expected to be recoverable in FERC approved rates and thus was recorded as a regulatory asset that will be amortized for rate recovery purposes over a period of   16   years. 

F. 
    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
       
  MVP Joint Venture 
    
  The MVP Joint Venture plans to construct the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), an estimated   300  -mile natural gas interstate pipeline spanning from northern West Virginia to southern Virginia. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a   45.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of   September 30, 2016  . The MVP Joint Venture has been determined to be a variable interest entity because the MVP Joint Venture has insufficient equity to finance its activities during the construction stage of the project. EQM is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the MVP Joint Venture that most significantly impact its economic performance. Certain business decisions require the approval of owners holding more than a 66 2/3% interest in the MVP Joint Venture and no one member owns more than a 66 2/3% interest. EQM accounted for the MVP Interest as an equity method investment as EQM has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the MVP Joint Venture.  
    
  The value of the equity method investment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately   $160.3 million   and   $77.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. On   October 17, 2016   MVP Holdco paid capital contributions of   $13.1 million   to the MVP Joint Venture. The capital contribution payable has been reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   with a corresponding increase to EQM's investment in the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  Equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on construction of the MVP is reported in other income in the statements of consolidated operations and was   $2.7 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6.1 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  On January 21, 2016, an affiliate of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ConEd) acquired a   12.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture,   8.5%   of which was purchased from EQM. EQM received a cash payment of approximately   $12.5 million  , which represented EQM's proportional capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture through the date of the transaction. ConEd has the right to terminate its purchase of the interest in the MVP Joint Venture and be reimbursed for the purchase price and all capital contributions it makes to the MVP Joint Venture for a period ending no later than December 31, 2016. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a   $91 million   performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the FERC s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, EQM's guarantee will terminate and EQM will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to   33%   of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to

     Table of Contents  

the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM's maximum financial statement exposure related to the MVP Joint Venture was approximately   $251 million  , which included the investment balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and amounts which could have become due under the performance guarantee as of that date. 
    
  Preferred Interest 
    
  EES was determined to be a variable interest entity because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities. EQM is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EES that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Preferred Interest in EES was determined to be a cost method investment as EQM does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of EES.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , EQM received cash distributions from EES of   $2.8 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively, which were included in other income in the accompanying statements of consolidated operations. EQM expects to receive cash distributions of approximately   $11 million   during the year ended   December 31, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES was approximately   $150 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, and the carrying value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES was   $124.3 million   at both dates. The fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES is a Level 3 fair value measurement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value represents EQM's maximum exposure to loss. 
    
  Concurrent with the October 2016 Acquisition, discussed in Note K, the operating agreement of EES was amended to include mandatory redemption of the Preferred Interest at the end of the preference period which is expected to be December 31, 2034. As a result of this amendment, EQM's investment in EES converted to a note receivable effective October 13, 2016.  This conversion does not impact the carrying value of this instrument; however, future distributions from EES will be recorded partly as interest income and partly as a reduction in the note receivable.  

G. 
    Credit Facility Borrowings 
       
  EQM has a   $750   million credit facility that expires in February 2019 (the   $750   Million Facility). The credit facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to purchase assets, to pay distributions, to repurchase units and for general partnership purposes. 
    
  EQM had   $91 million   of borrowings outstanding on its   $750   Million Facility as of   September 30, 2016   and had   $299 million   outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . The maximum amount of EQM s outstanding credit facility borrowings was   $91 million   and   $404 million   at any time during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $299 million   and   $404 million   at any time during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The average daily balance of credit facility borrowings outstanding was approximately   $34 million   and   $357 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $67 million   and   $241 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest was incurred on the credit facility borrowings at a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately   2.0%   and   1.9%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   1.7%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into a   $500 million  ,   364  -day, uncommitted revolving loan agreement with EQT (the   364  -Day Facility). The   364  -Day Facility will mature on October 25, 2017 and will automatically renew for successive   364  -day periods unless EQT delivers a non-renewal notice at least   60   days prior to the then current maturity date. EQM may terminate the   364  -Day Facility at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all loans together with interest thereon. The   364  -Day Facility is available for general partnership purposes and does not contain any covenants other than the obligation to pay accrued interest on outstanding borrowings. Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at an interest rate equal to the rate then applicable to similar loans under the   $750   Million Facility, or a successor revolving credit facility, less the sum of (i) the then applicable commitment fee under the   $750   Million Facility and (ii) 10 basis points. 

H. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
       
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, amounts due to/from related parties and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments; these are considered Level 1 fair values. The carrying value of credit facility borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; this is considered a Level 1 fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of EQM's long-term debt was  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

approximately   $493 million   and   $414 million  , respectively, and the carrying value of EQM's long-term debt was approximately   $494 million   and   $493 million  , respectively. The fair value of EQM's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note F for the fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES.  

I. 
    Income Taxes 
       
  As a result of its limited partnership structure, EQM is not subject to federal and state income taxes. For federal and state income tax purposes, all income, expenses, gains, losses and tax credits generated by EQM flow through to the unitholders; accordingly, EQM does not record a provision for income taxes.  
    
  As discussed in Note B, EQM completed the NWV Gathering Acquisition on March 17, 2015, which was a transaction between entities under common control. Prior to this transaction, the income from NWV Gathering was included in EQT s consolidated federal tax return; therefore, the NWV Gathering operations were subject to income taxes. Accordingly, the income tax effects associated with the operations of NWV Gathering prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition were reflected in EQM s consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with the NWV Gathering Acquisition, approximately   $84.4 million   of net current and deferred income tax liabilities were eliminated through equity. 

J. 
    Distributions 
       
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQM s unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.815   per common unit. The cash distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  . Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on   October 27, 2016  , cash distributions to EQGP related to its general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in EQM will be   $1.6 million   and   $24.9 million  , respectively. These distribution amounts to EQGP are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third quarter     2016   distribution. 

K.   
    Subsequent Events  
       
  On October 13, 2016, EQM entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with EQT and certain of EQT's affiliates pursuant to which EQM acquired from EQT (i)   100%   of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Allegheny Valley Connector, LLC (AVC) and Rager Mountain Storage Company LLC (Rager) and (ii) certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia (the Gathering Assets) (collectively, the October 2016 Acquisition). The closing of the October 2016 Acquisition occurred on October 13, 2016 and was effective as of October 1, 2016. The aggregate consideration paid by EQM to EQT in connection with the October 2016 Acquisition was   $275 million  , which was funded with borrowings under the   $750   Million Facility.   
    
  AVC, Rager and the Gathering Assets were businesses and the October 2016 Acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control. Therefore, EQM will record the acquired assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts to EQT on the effective date of the transaction, and the difference between EQT s net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to EQT will be recorded as a capital transaction with EQT. EQM will recast its consolidated financial statements to reflect the October 2016 Acquisition as if the assets were owned for all periods presented beginning with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

EQM has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events. While EQM considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond EQM s control. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance and results of EQM s business and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in EQM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and EQM does not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
    
  In reviewing any agreements incorporated by reference in or filed with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, please remember that such agreements are included to provide information regarding the terms of such agreements and are not intended to provide any other factual or disclosure information about EQM. The agreements may contain representations and warranties by EQM, which should not in all instances be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties to such agreements should those statements prove to be inaccurate. The representations and warranties were made only as of the date of the relevant agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in such agreement and are subject to more recent developments.  Accordingly, these representations and warranties alone may not describe the actual state of affairs of EQM or its affiliates as of the date they were made or at any other time. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , EQM reported net income of   $126.6 million   compared to   $94.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase primarily resulted from higher revenues from both gathering and transmission and storage, which were primarily driven by affiliate production development in the Marcellus Shale, higher other income and lower interest expense.  These items were partly offset by an increase in operating expenses, consistent with the growth of the business.  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , EQM reported net income of   $380.4 million   compared to   $280.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase resulted from higher revenues from both gathering and transmission and storage which were primarily driven by affiliate production development in the Marcellus Shale, higher other income and lower interest and income tax expense. These items were partly offset by an increase in operating expenses consistent with the growth of the business. 
    
  EQM declared a cash distribution to unitholders of   $0.815   per unit on   October 25, 2016  , which was   4%   higher than the second quarter 2016 distribution of   $0.78   per unit and   21%   higher than the   third quarter     2015   distribution of   $0.675   per unit. 
    
  Business Segment Results of Operations 
    
  Operating segments are revenue-producing components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Other income and interest are managed on a consolidated basis. EQM has presented each segment s operating income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of segments. EQM has reconciled each segment s operating income to EQM s consolidated operating income and net income in Note D to the consolidated financial statements.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

(1) 
    Includes fees on volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. 
       
           (2) 
    Includes volumes gathered under interruptible contracts and volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. 
       
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Gathering revenues increased by   $14.5 million   primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM increased firm reservation fee revenues as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

300 MMcf per day following the completion of the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity. 
    
  Operating expenses increased by   $2.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Gathering revenues increased by   $50.2 million   primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM increased firm reservation fee revenues as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in a decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts. 
    
  Operating expenses increased by   $9.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects. 
    
  TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE 
    
  Operating revenues and operating expenses related to the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC) facilities did not have an impact on adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow as the excess of the AVC revenues over operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses were paid to EQT as the monthly lease payment. All revenues related to the AVC facilities are from third parties.

  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Transmission and storage revenues increased by   $7.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This was driven by higher usage fees under firm contracts as a result of an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This reduction did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fee revenues increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes transported on an interruptible basis.  
    
  Operating expenses increased by   $0.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to the increased investment in the AVC facilities. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Transmission and storage revenues increased by   $25.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fee revenues increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes transported on an interruptible basis.  
    
  Operating expenses increased by   $4.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the increased investment in the AVC facilities and additional assets placed in-service. 
    
  Other Income Statement Items 
    
  Other income increased by   $10.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by increased AFUDC - equity of $5.7 million mainly attributable to increased spending on the OVC project, distributions received from EES of   $2.8 million   which began in January 2016 and higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP. Other income increased by   $25.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by increased AFUDC - equity of $11.5 million mainly attributable to increased spending on the OVC project, distributions received from EES of   $8.3 million   and higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP. 
    
  Interest expense decreased by   $3.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by higher capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt associated with increased spending on regulated projects of $1.6 million, decreased interest expense of $1.3 million on lower credit facility borrowings and lower capital lease interest expense. Interest expense decreased by   $7.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily driven by higher capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $3.2 million associated with increased spending on regulated projects, lower capital lease interest expense of   $2.1 million   and decreased interest expense on lower credit facility borrowings. As a result of the OVC beginning service on October 1, 2016, AFUDC - debt will substantially decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Concurrent with the October 2016 Acquisition, discussed in Note K, the operating agreement of EES was amended to include mandatory redemption of the Preferred Interest at the end of the preference period which is expected to be December 31, 2034. As a result of this amendment, EQM's investment in EES converted to a note receivable effective October 13, 2016.  This conversion does not impact the carrying value of this instrument, however, future distributions from EES will be recorded partly as interest income and partly as a reduction in the note receivable. This change will decrease the amount of other income  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

recognized in future periods and increase interest income. It will have no impact on expected cash flows during the preference period.  
    
  EQM is not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. As previously noted, the NWV Gathering Acquisition, which closed on March 17, 2015, was a transaction between entities under common control for which the consolidated financial statements of EQM were retrospectively recast to reflect the combined entities.  Accordingly, the income tax effects associated with NWV Gathering's operations prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition were reflected in the consolidated financial statements as NWV Gathering was previously part of EQT s consolidated federal tax return. The decrease in income tax expense resulted from the timing of the NWV Gathering Acquisition. 
    
  See  Investing Activities  and  Capital Requirements  in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity  section below for a discussion of capital expenditures. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  EQM defines adjusted EBITDA as EQM's net income plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense (if applicable) and non-cash long-term compensation expense less equity income, AFUDC - equity, capital lease payments and NWV Gathering adjusted EBITDA prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition. EQM defines distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less interest expense excluding capital lease interest, capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements.  Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of EQM s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess: 

EQM s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; 
                
    the ability of EQM s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to EQM s unitholders; 
                
    EQM s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
                
    the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
       
  EQM believes that adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide useful information to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, EQM s adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measures. Distributable cash flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that EQM has available for distributions from operating surplus or that EQM plans to distribute.

    Reflects capital lease payments due under the lease. These lease payments are generally made monthly on a one month lag. 
       
           (2) 
    Adjusted EBITDA attributable to NWV Gathering prior to acquisition for the periods presented was excluded from EQM s adjusted EBITDA calculations as these amounts were generated by NWV Gathering prior to EQM s acquisition; therefore, they were not amounts that could have been distributed to EQM s unitholders. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to NWV Gathering for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was calculated as net income of   $11.1 million   plus depreciation and amortization expense of   $2.0 million   plus income tax expense of   $6.7 million  .

    As a result of the increased significance of capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt in 2016, this line item was added as an adjustment to the calculation of distributable cash flow for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Had distributable cash flow been calculated on a consistent basis, it would have been $1.5 million and $3.1 million lower for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, than the numbers presented herein. 
       
           (4) 
    Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, net of expected reimbursements excludes ongoing maintenance that EQM expects to be reimbursed or that was reimbursed by EQT under the terms of EQM's omnibus agreement of   $0.4 million   and   $5.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.6 million   and   $7.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, it excludes ongoing maintenance attributable to NWV Gathering prior to acquisition of   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
       
  See "Executive Overview" above for a discussion of EQM's net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. EQM's adjusted EBITDA increased by   $22.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   $95.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of higher operating income on increased revenues driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale, the NWV Gathering Acquisition, which resulted in EBITDA subsequent to the transaction being reflected in adjusted EBITDA, and distributions from EES.  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow, increased by   $50.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as discussed in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity" section below. Distributable cash flow increased by   $23.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and   $93.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   mainly attributable to the increase in adjusted EBITDA. 

Outlook 
    
  EQM s principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that it pays to its unitholders over time while ensuring the ongoing growth of its business. EQM believes that it is well positioned to achieve growth based on the combination of its relationship with EQT and its strategically located assets, which cover portions of the Marcellus and Utica Shales that lack substantial natural gas pipeline infrastructure. EQM believes it has a competitive advantage in pursuing economically attractive organic expansion projects in its areas of operations, which EQM believes will be a key driver of growth in the future. EQM is also currently pursuing organic growth projects that are expected to provide access to markets in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions. Additionally, EQM may pursue asset acquisitions from third parties or, if EQT were to purchase assets or companies that contain midstream assets, EQT may make those assets available to EQM. Should EQT choose to pursue midstream asset sales, it is under no contractual obligation to offer the assets to EQM. 
    
  EQM expects that the following expansion projects will allow it to capitalize on drilling activity by EQT and third party producers: 

Ohio Valley Connector  . The OVC, which began service on October 1, 2016, is a 37-mile pipeline that extends EQM's transmission and storage system from northern West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio, at which point it interconnects with the Rockies Express Pipeline and may interconnect with other pipelines and liquidity points. The OVC will provide approximately 850 BBtu per day of transmission capacity with an aggregate compression of approximately 38,000 horsepower at an estimated cost of $360 million, excluding AFUDC, of which $220 million is expected to be spent in 2016. EQT has entered into a 20-year transportation service agreement with EQM for a total of 650 BBtu per day of firm transmission capacity on the OVC.  

Range Resources Header Pipeline Project  . EQM is constructing a natural gas header pipeline for a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources) in southwestern Pennsylvania to support Marcellus development. The pipeline is expected to cost approximately $250 million and is contracted to provide 600 MMcf per day of firm capacity backed by a ten-year firm capacity reservation commitment. EQM plans to complete the project in two phases. On October 1, 2016, phase one was placed into service providing 75 MMcf per day of firm capacity. Phase two is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017. EQM expects to invest approximately $180 million on the project in 2016. 

Gathering Expansion Projects.   EQM expects to invest a total of approximately $370 million, of which approximately $90 million is expected to be spent during 2016, related to expansion in the NWV Gathering development area. These expenditures are part of a fully subscribed expansion project expected to raise total firm gathering capacity in the

     Table of Contents  

NWV Gathering development area to 640 MMcf per day by mid-year 2017. EQM also plans to invest approximately $20 million in the Jupiter development area to install a gathering pipeline that will extend the gathering system to include additional EQT Production development areas in Greene County, Pennsylvania. As described in Note K, EQM acquired certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia from EQT as part of the October 2016 Acquisition. EQM expects to invest approximately $105 million over the next several years to complete planned expansion projects including the installation of approximately 20 miles of pipeline and four compressor units. EQM expects to spend approximately $5 million on this expansion project during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Equitrans and AVC Expansion Projects  . EQM is evaluating several multi-year transmission capacity expansion projects to support production growth in the Marcellus and Utica Shales that could total an additional 1.5 Bcf per day of capacity by year-end 2018. The projects may include additional compression, pipeline looping and new header pipelines. EQM expects to spend approximately $20 million on these expansion projects during 2016. As described in Note K, EQM acquired AVC from EQT as part of the October 2016 Acquisition. EQM expects to invest approximately $50 million in AVC related growth projects during the remainder of 2016 and 2017, of which approximately $25 million is expected to be spent during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Mountain Valley Pipeline  . The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture with affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc., WGL Holdings, Inc. and RGC Resources, Inc. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a   45.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of   October 27, 2016  . The 42 inch diameter MVP has a targeted initial capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day and is estimated to span 300-miles extending from EQM's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. As currently designed, the MVP is estimated to cost a total of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, with EQM funding its proportionate share through capital contributions made to the joint venture. In 2016, EQM expects to provide capital contributions of approximately $100 million to the MVP Joint Venture, primarily in support of material orders, environmental and land assessments and engineering design work. Expenditures are expected to increase substantially as construction commences, with the bulk of the expenditures expected to be made in 2017 and 2018. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments, including a 1.29 Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by EQT, and is currently in negotiation with additional shippers who have expressed interest in the MVP project. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP certificate application to the FERC in October 2015, and the FERC issued the Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review (NOS) and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on June 28, 2016 and September 16, 2016, respectively.  Based on the schedule provided in the NOS, the MVP Joint Venture anticipates receiving the certificate in mid-2017. The pipeline is targeted to be placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
       
  See further discussion of capital expenditures in the  Capital Requirements  section below.  
    
  Commodity Prices  
    
  EQM s business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas, including those resulting from regional basis differentials, could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM s pipeline and storage assets. Appalachian Basin market prices for natural gas were depressed throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. Lower regional natural gas prices could cause producers to determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of EQM s current areas of operation are strategically more attractive to them. In response to the depressed commodity price environment, a number of large natural gas producers announced their intention to re-evaluate and/or reduce their drilling programs in certain areas, including the Appalachian Basin. EQT's 2016 capital expenditure forecast is significantly lower than EQT's 2015 capital expenditures. EQT, or third party customers on EQM's systems, may reduce capital spending in the future based on commodity prices or other factors. Unless EQM is successful in attracting and retaining unaffiliated third party customers, which accounted for   49%   of transmission and storage revenues and   4%   of gathering revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , its ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported under service arrangements on its transmission and storage system as well as the volumes gathered on its gathering systems will be dependent on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated acreage to EQM, and has entered into long-term firm transmission and gathering contracts on EQM's systems, EQT may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it, and it is under no contractual obligation to continue to develop its acreage dedicated to EQM.  
    
  EQM believes the high percentage of its revenues derived from reservation charges under long-term, firm contracts will mitigate the risk of revenue fluctuations due to changes in near-term supply and demand conditions and commodity prices.

our areas of operation could adversely affect our business and operating results and reduce our distributable cash flow" included in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of EQM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  EQM s principal liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, fund capital expenditures and potential acquisitions, make cash distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. EQM s ability to meet these liquidity requirements will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future as well as its ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets. EQM s available sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowing under EQM's credit facilities, cash on hand, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM expects to fund its remaining 2016 capital expenditures with cash on hand and available debt capacity. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled   $370.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $319.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $50.5 million   increase was driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the  Executive Overview  and "Business Segment Results of Operations" sections herein, distributions received from EES of   $8.3 million   and lower interest and income tax expense, partly offset by the timing of payments between the two periods. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled   $494.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $891.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $397.6 million   decrease was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the NWV Gathering net assets from EQT and the Preferred Interest Acquisition, both of which occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases were partly offset by increased capital expenditures as further described in the "Capital Requirements" section herein. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled   $227.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $446.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The primary financing uses of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were net credit facility repayments and distributions to unitholders. The primary financing sources of cash for the period were the sale of common units under the $750 million ATM Program. Financing cash inflows for the first   nine   months of   2015   were from the March 2015 equity offering and net credit facility borrowings; the primary financing cash payments were for the NWV Gathering Acquisition in excess of net assets acquired and distributions to unitholders. 
    
  Capital Requirements    
    
  The gathering, transmission and storage businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations. The following table presents capital expenditures for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

     Table of Contents  

(1)    
    Expansion capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture. Capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture were   $35.6 million   and   $76.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. In the first quarter of 2015, EQM paid approximately   $54.2 million   for its acquisition of EQT's ownership interest in the MVP Joint Venture as described in Note B. 

Expansion capital expenditures increased by   $65.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of the timing of spending on projects. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Range Resources Header Pipeline project and the NWV Gathering expansion. In the   third   quarter of   2015  , expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Jupiter and NWV Gathering expansions. EQM completed the Jupiter gathering expansion in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
    
  Expansion capital expenditures increased by   $188.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as a result of the timing of spending on projects. In   2016  , expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Range Resources Header Pipeline project and the NWV Gathering expansion. In   2015  , expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the Jupiter and NWV Gathering expansions and the OVC. 
    
  In   2016  , expansion capital expenditures and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture are expected to be approximately $660 million and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $25 million, net of reimbursements. EQM s future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities and are expected to grow substantially in future periods for the Range Resources Header Pipeline project, the NWV Gathering expansion, the gathering and AVC expansion projects associated with the October 2016 Acquisition and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture. Maintenance related capital expenditures are also expected to vary quarter to quarter. EQM expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, availability under its credit facility, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM does not forecast capital expenditures associated with potential midstream projects not committed as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Credit Facility Borrowings 
    
  EQM has a $750 Million Facility that expires in February 2019 and had   $91 million   of borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The $750 Million Facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to purchase assets, to pay distributions, to repurchase units and for general partnership purposes. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the $750 Million Facility has an accordion feature that allows EQM to increase the available revolving borrowings under the facility by up to an additional $250 million. In addition, the $750 Million Facility includes a sublimit up to $75 million for same-day swing line advances and a sublimit up to $150 million for letters of credit. EQM has the right to request that one or more lenders make term loans to it under the $750 Million Facility subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which term loans will be secured by cash and qualifying investment grade securities. EQM s obligations under the revolving portion of the $750 Million Facility are unsecured. 
    
  EQM s $750 Million Facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the credit facility, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The covenants and events of default under the $750 Million Facility relate to maintenance of permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Under the $750 Million Facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants. 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into the 364-Day Facility (as defined in Note G) with EQT, which will mature on October 25, 2017. See Note G for further discussion of the uncommitted revolving loan agreement.

EQM s credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades EQM s ratings, EQM s access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs could increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and construction contracts, the amount of which may be substantial, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s, BBB- or higher by S P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including EQM's current credit rating of Ba1 by Moody's, is considered non-investment grade. 
    
  $750 million ATM Program 
    
  As of   October 27, 2016  , EQM had approximately   $443 million   in remaining capacity under the $750 million ATM Program. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQM s unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.815   per common unit. The cash distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  . Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on   October 27, 2016  , cash distributions to EQGP related to its general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in EQM will be   $1.6 million   and   $24.9 million  , respectively. These distribution amounts to EQGP are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third quarter     2016   distribution. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against EQM.  While the amounts claimed may be substantial, EQM is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. EQM accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. EQM has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, EQM believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make distributions. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a   $91 million   performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the FERC s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, EQM's guarantee will terminate and EQM will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to   33%   of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  EQM s critical accounting policies are described in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in EQM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been included in the notes to EQM s consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  . The application of EQM s critical accounting policies may require management to make  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements.  Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments.  Different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest EQM earns on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest rates EQM pays on borrowings on its credit facilities. EQM's long-term borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose EQM to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of EQM's fixed rate debt. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of EQM's borrowings and Note H to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements. EQM may from time to time hedge the interest on portions of its borrowings under the credit facilities in order to manage risks associated with floating interest rates. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  EQM is exposed to credit risk which is the risk that EQM may incur a loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. EQM manages its exposure to credit risk associated with customers through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures. For certain transactions, EQM may request letters of credit, cash collateral, prepayments or guarantees as forms of credit support. EQM s FERC tariff requires tariff customers that do not meet specified credit standards to provide three months of credit support; however, EQM is exposed to credit risk beyond this three month period when its tariff does not require its customers to provide additional credit support. For some of EQM s more recent long-term contracts associated with system expansions, it has entered into negotiated credit agreements that provide for enhanced forms of credit support if certain credit standards are not met. EQM has historically experienced only minimal credit losses in connection with its receivables. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately 90% of revenues were from investment grade counterparties. EQM is exposed to the credit risk of EQT, its largest customer. In connection with EQM's IPO in 2012, EQT guaranteed all payment obligations, up to a maximum of $50 million, due and payable to Equitrans by EQT Energy, LLC, one of Equitrans  largest customers and a wholly owned subsidiary of EQT. The EQT guaranty will terminate on November 30, 2023 unless terminated earlier by EQT upon 10 days written notice. At   September 30, 2016  , EQT s public senior debt had an investment grade credit rating. 
    
  Other Market Risks 
    
  EQM's $750 Million Facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by EQM. No one lender of the 18 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. EQM s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit EQM s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management of the EQM General Partner, including the EQM General Partner s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of EQM s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) was conducted as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the EQM General Partner concluded that EQM s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   third quarter   of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, EQM s internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   26 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against EQM. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, EQM is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. EQM accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. EQM has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, EQM believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make distributions. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  On April 8, 2016, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing new requirements applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering lines. As a result of the publication of the NPRM, EQM determined to replace in its entirety the second paragraph of the risk factor entitled  We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs  in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of EQM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as follows:  
    
  Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators.  For example, in August 2011, PHMSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (2011 Notice) in which the agency was seeking public comment on a number of changes to regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, including, for example, revising the definitions of  high consequence areas  and  gathering lines  and strengthening integrity management requirements as they apply to existing regulated operators and to currently exempt operators should certain exemptions be removed. In April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking responding to several of the integrity management topics raised in the 2011 Notice and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines that have arisen since the issuance of the 2011 Notice.  The proposed rule, which is subject to a public comment period, would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. We are monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on our operations. 
    
  Except as set forth above, as of the date of this report, EQM's risk factors have not changed materially from those discussed in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of EQM s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 5. Other Information 
    
  364-Day Facility 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into the 364-Day Facility (as defined in Note G) with EQT, which will mature on October 25, 2017. The 364-Day Facility will automatically renew for successive 364-day periods unless EQT delivers a non-renewal notice at least 60 days prior to the then current maturity date.  EQM may terminate the 364-Day Facility at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all loans together with interest thereon. The 364-Day Facility is available for general partnership purposes and does not contain any covenants other than the obligation to pay accrued interest on outstanding borrowings. Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at an interest rate equal to the rate then applicable to similar loans under EQM s $750 Million Facility (as defined in Note G), less the sum of (i) the then applicable commitment fee under the $750 Million Facility and (ii) 10 basis points. 
    
  The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 364-Day Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated in this Item 5 by reference. 
    
  Relationships 
    
  The EQM General Partner is indirectly controlled by EQT through EQT s control of EQGP.  As of September 30, 2016, EQGP and its subsidiaries owned 21,811,643 EQM common units, representing a 26.6% limited partnership interest, 1,443,015 EQM general partner units, representing a 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights in EQM.

Exhibit 10.1 
    
  Execution Version 
    
  364-DAY UNCOMMITTED REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT 
  This 364-DAY UNCOMMITTED REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended, supplemented and restated from time to time, this    Agreement   ) is made as of October 26, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ), between EQT Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (together with its successors and assigns,    Lender   ) and EQT Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (   Borrower   ). 
  For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Lender and Borrower agree as follows: 
  1.  Loans  .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (together with other capitalized terms not defined in the body of this Agreement, as defined in   Exhibit A  ), Borrower may request that Lender make revolving loans (   Loans   ) to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount outstanding not to exceed $500,000,000 at any time (the    Maximum Facility Amount   ). The funding of any such Loans is within the sole and absolute discretion of Lender.  Borrower may request that any Loans be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided and defined herein. 
    
  2.  Repayment of the Loans  .   
    
  (a)   Promise to Pay  .  Borrower promises to pay the then-outstanding principal balance of the Loans, together with interest accrued and outstanding thereon and any other sums due hereunder, on the Maturity Date, as such Maturity Date may be extended as set forth in this   Section 2  .  
    
  (b)   Extension of Maturity Date  .  So long as (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) a non-renewal notice has not been delivered by Lender in accordance with   Section 9   at least 60 days prior to the then-effective Maturity Date, the Maturity Date shall automatically be extended for an additional 364-day period (with no limit on the number of such successive automatic annual extensions under this   Section 2(b)   prior to the termination hereof).  If Lender delivers a non-renewal notice at least 60 days prior to the then-effective Maturity Date, then on such Maturity Date Borrower shall pay in full the unpaid principal amount of all Loans owing to Lender, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all fees accrued and unpaid under this Agreement to the date of such payment of principal and all other amounts due to Lender under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any such extension of the Maturity Date, Borrower may terminate this Agreement at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all Loans owing to Lender, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due to Lender under this Agreement.  As a condition to such termination, Borrower shall provide notice to Lender specifying the date of such termination.  Upon payment in full of all outstanding amounts owed to Lender hereunder on the date specified in such termination notice, this Agreement will automatically terminate (other than the provisions that by their express terms survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and termination of this Agreement).    
    
  3.  Procedure for Requesting a Borrowing  .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including   Section 7  , Borrower may request to borrow Loans (or continue Eurodollar Rate  

Loans or convert Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans or convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans) on any Business Day;   but   Borrower shall provide a written request (each a    Borrowing Request   ) to Lender no later than 11:00 am (Pittsburgh time) on the Business Day that is at least three Business Days before the date of the proposed funding of a Loan or the date of the conversion or continuation of any Loan (each a    Borrowing Date   ), which must be a Business Day. Borrower shall give such request in a form acceptable to Lender and each such Borrowing Request shall specify (i) whether Borrower is requesting a Loan, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the location and number of Borrower s account to which funds are to be disbursed.  If Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Borrowing Request or if Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then to the extent Lender agrees to make a Loan, the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.  If Borrower requests a borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Borrowing Request, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  A Loan may only be made in US Dollars.  If Lender in its sole discretion agrees to make any Loan, Lender will make such Loans available to Borrower by promptly crediting such amounts to the account of Borrower designated by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.  If Lender in its sole discretion decides to not make any Loan requested by Borrower, Lender will notify Borrower of its decision to not make such Loan by 11:00 am (Pittsburgh time) on the Business Day before the proposed Borrowing Date.  
    
  4.  Interest  . 
    
  (a)     Interest Rate  . Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. 
    
  (b)     Default Interest  . If any amount payable by Borrower under this Agreement is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws (including the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania).  Furthermore, while any Event of Default exists, Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Loans hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws (including the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania).  Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. 
    
  (c)       Interest Payment Dates  .  Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified  
  
   2 

herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law.  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. 
    
  5.  Increased Costs; Taxes; Prepayments of Loans; Guarantee Requirement  .   
    
  (a)    Increased Costs  .  Borrower shall pay increased costs on the Loans and taxes in connection with the Loans, in each case in accordance with the procedures and terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement as if the Loans were loans thereunder and Lender were a lender thereunder. 
    
  (b)    Prepayment  .  Borrower may, at its option, as provided in this   Section 5  , at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon notice to Lender specifying (i) the date and amount of prepayment and (ii) the respective amounts to be prepaid in respect of such Loans.  The payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified.  All prepayments pursuant to this   Section 5   shall include accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment. 
    
  (c)    Guarantee Requirement  .  If any Subsidiary of Borrower provides a guarantee of Borrower s obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, then Borrower shall cause such Subsidiary to promptly guarantee the obligations of Borrower hereunder pursuant to a guarantee agreement in form and substance substantially similar to the guarantee agreement delivered under the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
    
  6.  Borrower s Representations and Warranties  .  Borrower represents and warrants to Lender, on the date of this Agreement and on the date of each Borrowing Request in respect of the funding of a Loan and on the Borrowing Date when a Loan is funded,  that: 
    
  (a)   Borrower (i) has been duly formed and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) is qualified to do business as a foreign entity in good standing in each jurisdiction of the United States in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and where the failure to so qualify would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;  
    
  (b)   this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Borrower and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws of general application relating to the enforcement of creditors  rights; and 
    
  (c)   the sum of (i) the principal amount of such Loan requested on a Borrowing Date plus (ii) the principal amount of all other Loans outstanding on such Borrowing Date, does not exceed the Maximum Facility Amount. 
    
  7.  Discretionary Lending  .  The obligation of Lender to make any Loan is subject to the sole and absolute discretion of Lender.    
  
   3 

8.  Events of Default  .  If one or more of the following events of default (each an    Event of Default   ) shall occur and be continuing:

    Non-Payment  .

           (b) 
    Insolvency Proceedings, Etc.   Borrower or any Subsidiary institutes or consents to the institution of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or applies for or consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer for it or for all or any material part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer is appointed without the application or consent of such Person and the appointment continues undischarged or unstayed for 60 calendar days; or any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any such Person or to all or any material part of its property is instituted without the consent of such Person and continues undismissed or unstayed for 60 calendar days, or an order for relief is entered in any such proceeding;  
       
           (c) 
    Inability to Pay Debts; Attachment  . (i) Borrower or any Subsidiary admits in writing its inability or fails generally to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) any writ or warrant of attachment or execution or similar process is issued or levied against all or any material part of the property of any such Person and is not released, vacated or fully bonded within 30 days after its issue or levy;

           (f) 
    Cross-Payment Default.    Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) fails to make any payment when due (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand, or otherwise) in respect of any indebtedness (other than the Loans) of Borrower and one or more Subsidiaries, arising in one or more related or unrelated transactions, in an aggregate principal or face amount exceeding $15,000,000 (   Material Debt   ) or (ii) fails to observe or perform any other agreement or condition relating to any Material Debt or contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event occurs, the effect of which default or other event is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such Material Debt to cause, with the giving of notice if required, the maturity of such Material Debt to be accelerated or to cause such Material Debt to be repurchased, prepaid, defeased or redeemed (automatically or otherwise), or an  
     
   4

  then and in each and every case Lender, by notice in writing to Borrower, may declare the unpaid balance of the Loans and any other amounts payable hereunder to be forthwith due and payable, and thereupon such balance shall become so due and payable without presentation, protest or further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived;   but   in the case of   Section 8(b)   above, the Loans and any other amounts payable hereunder shall forthwith automatically and without further action be due and payable.

  WHEREAS,   EQT and Employee have agreed that Employee will step down from her position as Vice President, Finance   Chief Accounting Officer of EQT Corporation effective at 11:59 p.m. September 9, 2016 (the "Step Down Date"); and 
    
  WHEREAS,   following the Step Down Date, in order to facilitate a smooth transition to her successor, subject to approval by the EQT Corporation Board of Directors, Employee has agreed to assume the position of Vice President, Finance Special Projects for EQT (and Employee will remain an Executive Officer of EQT) and EQT has agreed to permit Employee to remain employed (subject to the terms of this Agreement) through September 30, 2016; and 
    
  WHEREAS,   Employee will discontinue full time employment with EQT on September 30, 2016 but will remain employed by EQT pursuant to the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement ("EAWA Employment Agreement") (referenced below) in accordance with Section 9 of the Non-Compete Agreement (referenced below and modified as contemplated hereby); 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE,   in consideration of the respective representations, acknowledgments, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 
    
  1.     The term of this Agreement is from the date upon which this Agreement becomes effective through September 30, 2016.  Effective at 11:59 p.m. on September 30, 2016, Employee will discontinue full time employment with EQT. 
    
  2.     Through the Step Down Date, Employee will continue in her Vice President Finance   Chief Accounting Officer position with EQT, her Vice President, Finance   Chief Accounting Officer position with EQT GP Services, LLC (the "EQGP General Partner''), and her Vice President, Finance   Chief Accounting Officer position with EQT Midstream Services, LLC (the "EQM General Partner'').

  3.     In exchange for Employee's execution and non-revocation of this Agreement, EQT and Employee hereby agree to amend the Non-Compete Agreement attached as   Exhibit C   hereto as follows: 
    
  a.     Replace Paragraph 9 of the Non-Compete Agreement with the following: 
    
  Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Status  .  As part of the Original Agreement, Employee elected to participate in the "Executive Alternative Work Arrangement program upon Employee's voluntary discontinuance of full-time status.

The terms and conditions of Employee's Executive Alternative Work Arrangement, which were set forth in an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement attached as Exhibit A to the Original Agreement, are being revised and updated currently herewith, and are set forth in the form of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.  Employee agrees to execute an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement, in a form substantially similar to the one attached hereto as Exhibit A, within 90 days prior to Employee's relinquishment of full-time status, which agreement will become effective automatically on the day following Employee's Eligible Termination.  Without limiting the foregoing, Employee agrees that he/she will not be eligible for the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement, including the post-employment benefits described therein if Employee's termination of employment is not an Eligible Termination. 
    
  4.     Employee will execute the EAWA Employment Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit B   at the time she executes this Agreement and, provided she remains eligible pursuant to the terms of Section 9 of the Non-Compete Agreement as amended by Paragraph 3 above and the EAWA Employment Agreement, she will become an EAWA employee of EQT pursuant to the terms of the EAWA Employment Agreement as of October 1, 2016.

Employee will be compensated pursuant to the EAWA Employment Agreement for any time spent providing support or cooperation under this Paragraph 8 while the EAWA Employment Agreement is in effect.   
    
  9.     EQT's obligation to provide the payments set forth in Paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be subject to Employee's execution of the Supplemental Release attached as Exhibit A and incorporated into this Agreement. Upon Employee's discontinuation of full time employment with EQT on September 30, 2016, she will have 21 days to consider the Supplemental Release and decide whether to sign it.

  10.     In consideration for EQT's commitments herein, Employee, on behalf of herself, her heirs, representatives, estates, successors and assigns, does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release and forever discharge EQT, its predecessors, subsidiaries, affiliates, and benefit plans, and their past, present and future officers, directors, trustees, administrators, agents and employees, as well as the heirs, successors and assigns of any such persons or such entities (hereinafter severally and collectively called "Releasees") from any and all suits, actions, causes of action, damages and claims, known and unknown, that Employee has or may have against any of the Releasees for any acts, practices or events up to and including the date she signs this Agreement, except for the performance of the provisions of this Agreement, it being the intention of Employee to effect a general release of all such claims.  This release includes any and all claims under any possible legal, equitable, contract, tort, or statutory theory, including but not limited to any claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 
  
   -  5  - 

the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, the City of Pittsburgh Human Relations Ordinance, all as amended, and other federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, executive orders, regulations and other laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and state, federal or local law claims of any other kind whatsoever (including common law tort and contract claims) arising out of or in any way related to Employee's employment with EQT. Employee also specifically releases all Releasees from any and all claims or causes of action for the fees, costs and expenses of any and all attorneys who have at any time or are now representing her in connection with this Agreement or in connection with any matter released in this Agreement. 
    
  The release in the preceding paragraph is intended to be a general release, excluding only claims which Employee is legally barred from releasing.  Employee understands that the release does not include: any claims that cannot be released or waived as a matter of law; any claim for or right to vested benefits under the Company's plans; any right to enforce this Agreement; and any claims based on acts or events occurring after Employee signs this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents a challenge to the validity of the Agreement or prohibits the filing of a charge or complaint with, or testimony, assistance or participation in, any investigation, proceeding or hearing conducted by any federal, state or local governmental agency, including but not limited to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
    
  11.     Employee warrants that she has no actions now pending against Releasees in any court of the United States or any State thereof based upon any acts or events arising out of or related to her employment with EQT.  Notwithstanding any other language in this Agreement, the parties understand that this agreement does not prohibit Employee from filing an administrative charge of alleged employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Equal Pay Act.  Employee, however, waives her right to monetary or other recovery should any federal, state or local administrative agency pursue any claims on her behalf arising out of or relating to her employment with any of the Releasees.  This means that by signing this Agreement, Employee will have waived any right she had to obtain a recovery if an administrative agency pursues a claim on her behalf against any of the Releasees based on any actions taken by any of the Releasees up to the date of the signing of this Agreement and the Supplemental Release, and that Employee will have released the Releasees of any and all claims of any nature arising up to the dates of the signing of this Agreement and the Supplemental Release. 
    
  12.     Employee agrees that (unless otherwise required by law or legal process) she will not, directly or indirectly, in any capacity or manner, make, express, transmit, speak, write, verbalize or otherwise communicate in any way any remark, comment, message, information, declaration, communication or other statement of any kind, whether oral or in writing, whether in tangible format, electronic format, or otherwise, that might reasonably be construed to be derogatory, critical, negative or disparaging about EQT (including its business operations and practices), its past or present officers, administrators, managers, directors, trustees or employees and/or detrimental towards EQT s business reputation or goodwill.  Employee likewise shall not cause, assist, solicit or encourage anyone else to engage in any of the foregoing behavior.  EQT agrees to direct all of the Executive Officers of EQT Corporation and all of the employees in its Human Resources Department to not make any negative or disparaging comments about Employee to the media, to any other members of the public or any potential employers.  EQT also agrees that a reasonable time in advance of the filing or  
  
   -  6  - 

issuance of such documents, it will provide Employee with drafts of all information to be filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) addressing Employee s employment with EQT, including her compensation and reasons for departure.  Employee may make suggestions with respect to such documents but understands the statements to be made will be determined by EQT in good faith after considering Employee s suggestions.  Employee may share such documents with her legal counsel but otherwise agrees to keep the existence and contents of such documents confidential until filed or furnished to the SEC.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, EQT shall have no duty to provide such information after December 31, 2017 as long as the information included in any such document is substantially the same as information previously disclosed.  
    
  13.     By entering into this Agreement, EQT in no way admits that it or any of the Releasees has treated Employee unlawfully or wrongfully in any way.  Neither this Agreement nor the implementation thereof shall be construed to be, or shall be admissible in any proceedings as, evidence of any admission by EQT or any of the Releasees of any violation of or failure to comply with any federal, state, or local law, ordinance, agreement, rule, regulation or order. 
    
  14.     Employee expressly warrants that she was advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.  She acknowledges that she has been afforded the opportunity to consider this Agreement for a period of at least twenty-one (21) calendar days, which is a reasonable period of time, that she has carefully read this Agreement, that she understands completely its contents and that she has executed the same of her own free will, act and deed.  If Employee signs this Agreement in less than twenty-one (21) calendar days, she acknowledges that she has thereby waived her right to the full twenty-one (21) day period. 
    
  15.     Employee will have a period of seven (7) calendar days following her execution of this Agreement to revoke it, and this Agreement will not be effective or enforceable prior to the expiration of that seven-day revocation period.  If Employee does not advise Charlene Petrelli, Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 in writing that she revokes this Agreement within seven (7) calendar days of her execution of it, she understand that this Agreement will be effective and enforceable. 
    
  16.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any agreement that survives the execution of this Agreement,  in the event of any suit by a party to this Agreement against the other party regarding the enforcement or enforceability of the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement that survives the execution of this Agreement, including the Non-Compete Agreement, the prevailing party in such suit shall have its reasonable attorneys  fees paid by the non-prevailing party. 
    
  17.     The provisions of this Agreement are severable.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable in any court of law, the parties intend that such provision be construed by such court in a manner to make it enforceable. 
    
  18.     This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. 
  
   -  7  - 

19.     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. 
    
  20.     Except (i) as provided in the second sentence of this paragraph; (ii) for the Amended and Restated Indemnification Agreement made as of December 3, 2008 between EQT and the Employee; (iii) for the Indemnification Agreement made as of May 15, 2015 between EQT GP Holding, L.P. and the Employee; (iv) for the Indemnification Agreement made as of January 18, 2012 between EQT Midstream Partners, L.P. and the Employee; and (v) as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, contains the entire agreement between the parties and it supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between EQT and Employee (oral or written).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee's covenants and obligations set forth in the Non-Compete Agreement, in each case to the extent not inconsistent with this 
  Agreement, remain in full force and effect. 
    
  21.     This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by both parties. 
    
  22.       EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE HAS CAREFULLY READ AND FULLY UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT SHE IS VOLUNTARILY EXECUTING AND ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY IT  .

Employee s status as Executive Alternative Work Arrangement (and this one-year Agreement) will automatically renew annually unless either party terminates this Agreement by written notice to the other not less than 30 days prior to the renewal date.  The automatic annual renewals of this Agreement will cease, however, at the end of five years of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status. 
    
  2.  During each one year period in Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status, Employee is required to provide no less than 100 hours of service to EQT.  During each one-year period, Employee will also make himself/herself available for up to 300 additional hours of service upon request from the Company.  All such hours of service will occur during the Company s regularly scheduled business hours (unless otherwise agreed by the parties), and no more than fifty (50) hours will be scheduled per month (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). 
    
  3.  Employee shall be paid an hourly rate for Employee s actual services provided under this Agreement.  The hourly rate shall be Employee s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to Employee s change in employee classification to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status divided by 2080.  Employee shall submit monthly time sheets in a form agreed upon by the parties, and Employee will be paid on regularly scheduled payroll dates in accordance with the Company s standard payroll practices following submission of his/her time sheets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that during any one-year period in Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status, EQT requests Employee to provide less than 100 hours of service, EQT shall pay Employee for a minimum of 100 hours of service (regardless of the actual number of hours of service), with any remaining amount owed payable on the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the end of the applicable one-year period.  If either party terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof, no additional compensation will be paid to Employee pursuant to this Section 3.

4.  Employee shall be eligible to continue to participate in the group medical (including prescription drug), dental and vision programs in which Employee participated immediately before the classification change to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement (as such plans might be modified by the Company from time-to-time), but Employee will be required to pay 100% of the Company s premium (or premium equivalent) rates to the carriers (the full active employee premium rates - both the employee portion and the employer portion -  as adjusted year-to-year) for participation in such group insurance programs.  If Employee completes five years of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status or if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, Employee will be allowed to participate in such group insurance programs at 102% of the then-applicable full active employee premium rates (both the employee portion and the employer portion) until the earlier of:  (i) Employee becomes eligible to receive Medicare benefits and (ii) Employee reaches age 70, even though Employee is no longer employed by EQT.  Employee acknowledges that, to the extent, if at all, the Company s cost to include Employee in the group insurance programs pursuant to this paragraph exceeds the cost paid by the Employee, the benefits provided hereunder may result in taxable income to the Employee.  All amounts required to be paid by Employee pursuant to this paragraph shall be due not later than 30 days after written notice thereof is sent by the Company.  Company may terminate the benefits provided under this Agreement upon 30 days written notice of any failure by Employee to timely perform his/her payment obligation hereunder, unless such failure is earlier cured.        
    
  5.  During the term of this Agreement, Employee will continue to receive service credit for purposes of calculating the value of the Medical Spending Account.   
    
  6.  Employee shall not be eligible to participate in the Company s life insurance and disability insurance programs, 401(k) Plan, ESPP, or any other retirement or welfare benefit programs or perquisites of the Company.  Likewise, Employee shall not receive any paid vacation, paid holidays or car allowance.   
    
  7.  Employee is not eligible to receive bonus payments under any short-term incentive plans of EQT, and is not eligible to receive any new grants under EQT s long-term incentive plans, programs or arrangements. 
    
  8.  Effective not later than the commencement of this Executive Alternative Work Arrangement, Employee shall be deemed to have retired for purposes of measuring vesting and/or post termination exercise periods of all forms of long term incentive awards.  The timing of any payments for such awards will be as provided in the underlying plans, programs or arrangements and is subject to any required six-month delay in payment if Employee is a  specified employee  under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) at the time of Employee s separation from service, with respect to payments made by reason of Employee s separation from service.  Nothing in this paragraph 8, or in paragraph 7, shall prevent (a) the continued vesting of previously granted long-term incentive awards to the extent the award agreement therefore expressly contemplates continued vesting while the recipient serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company or an affiliate or (b) grants of non-employee director awards to an individual solely because such individual serves on the Board of Directors of the Company or an affiliate.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any special vesting and/or payment provisions applicable to Employee s long-term incentive awards pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement between EQT and Employee dated July 29, 2015  
  
   -  12  - 

(as amended from time to time, the  Non-Competition Agreement ) shall apply and be given effect. 
    
  9.  The Company shall either pay on behalf of Employee or reimburse Employee for the cost of (i) monthly dues for one country club and one dining club (such clubs to be approved by the Company s Chief Executive Officer), and (ii) executive level physicals (currently  gold  level) and related health and wellness services for Employee and Employee s spouse (up to a maximum annual benefit of $15,000), in each case during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof in accordance with and on the dates specified in the Company s policies;   provided, however,   that no such payments or reimbursements shall be made until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code;   provided, further,   that to the extent reimbursed or paid, all reimbursements and payments with respect to expenses incurred within a particular year shall be made no later than the end of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of payments or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year of Employee shall not affect the amount of reimbursable expenses in a different taxable year, and such payments or reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.   
    
  10.  Employee shall continue to have mobile telephone service and reasonable access to the Company s Help Desk during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof; provided, however, if the provision of such service will result in taxable income to Employee, then no such taxable service shall be provided until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.   
    
  11.  Employee shall receive tax, estate and financial planning services from providers approved in advance by the Company during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof, in amount not to exceed $15,000 per calendar year, to be paid directly by the Company in accordance with and on the dates specified in the Company s policies;   provided, however,   that no such payments or reimbursements shall be made until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of Code;   provided, further,   that to the extent reimbursed or paid, all reimbursements and payments with respect to expenses incurred within a particular year shall be made no later than the end of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of payments or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year of Employee shall not affect the amount of payments or reimbursable expenses in a different taxable year, and such payments or reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.   
    
  12.  During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall maintain an ownership level of Company stock equal to not less than one-half of the value last required as a full-time Employee.  In the event that at any time during the term of this Agreement Employee does not maintain the required ownership level, Employee shall promptly notify the Company and increase his or her ownership to at least the required level.  Any failure of Employee to maintain  
  
   -  13  - 

at least the required ownership level for more than three months during the term of this Agreement shall constitute and be deemed to be an immediate termination by Employee of his or her Executive Alternative Work Arrangement.    
    
  13.  This Agreement sets forth all of the payments, benefits, perquisites and entitlements to which Employee shall be entitled upon assuming Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status.  Employee shall not be entitled to receive any gross-up payments for any taxes or other amounts with respect to amounts payable under this Agreement. 
    
  14.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit the Company from modifying any of its employee benefits plans, programs, or policies.

It is understood and agreed that if Employee s employment as an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employee terminates for any reason in the midst of any one-year term period as provided under this Agreement (including, without limitation, a termination pursuant to Sections 4, 12 or 17 of this Agreement), the covenants as to non-competition and non-solicitation contained in the Non-Competition Agreement shall remain in effect throughout the remainder of that one-year term and for a period of      twenty-four (24) months, in the case of non-competition covenants, and thirty-six (36) months, in the case of non-solicitation covenants,     months thereafter.  
    
  16.  Confidential Information and Non-Disclosure  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee s employment by the Company necessarily involves Employee s knowledge of and access to confidential and proprietary information pertaining to the business of the Company.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and for as long as the information remains confidential after the termination of Employee's employment, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written authority of the Company, unless directed by applicable legal authority having jurisdiction over Employee, disclose to or use, or knowingly permit to be so disclosed or used, for the benefit of Employee, any person, corporation or other entity other than the Company, (i) any information concerning any financial matters, employees of the Company, customer relationships, competitive status, supplier matters, internal organizational matters, current or future plans, or other business affairs of or relating to the Company, (ii) any management, operational, trade, technical or other secrets or any other proprietary information or other data of the Company, or (iii) any other information related to the Company which has not been published and is not generally known outside of the Company.  Employee acknowledges that all of the foregoing constitutes confidential and proprietary information, which is the exclusive property of the Company.  Nothing in this Section 16 prohibits Employee from reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state, or local law or regulation. 
  
   -  14  - 

17.  EQT may terminate this Agreement and Employee s employment at any time for Cause.  Solely for purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean: (i) Employee s conviction of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude or fraud or Employee having committed fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement in connection with the performance of his/her duties; (ii) Employee s willful and repeated failures to substantially perform assigned duties; or (iii) Employee s violation of any provision of this Agreement or express significant policies of the Company.  If the Company terminates Employee s employment for Cause, the Company shall give Employee written notice setting forth the reason for his/her termination not later than 30 days after such termination. 
    
  18.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, or arising out of any other matter relating to the Employee's employment with EQT or the termination of such employment, EQT may seek recourse for injunctive relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof and if any relief other than injunctive relief is sought, EQT and the Employee agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 18 of this Agreement and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ).  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards, if any, rendered by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the  Arbitration Panel ).  EQT and the Employee shall each select one arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators (the  Commercial Panel ) and AAA shall select a third arbitrator from the Commercial Panel.  Any award rendered by the Arbitration Panel shall be final, binding and confidential as between the parties hereto and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
    
  19.  EQT shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require Employee to remit to EQT, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including Employee s FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement.  The obligations of EQT under this Agreement will be conditioned on such payment or arrangements and EQT will, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Employee.   
    
  20.  It is understood and agreed that upon Employee s discontinuation of full-time employment and transition to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status hereunder, Employee has no continuing rights under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement and such section shall have no further force or effect. 
    
  21.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable in any court of law, the parties intend that such provision be construed by such court in a manner to make it enforceable. 
    
  22.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. 
    
  23.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. 
    
  24.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between EQT and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof (oral or written), including but not

limited to Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement.  It is understood and agreed, however, that the Transition Agreement and General Release, the Supplemental Release and the covenants as to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and nondisclosure contained in Sections 1 and 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement remain in effect as modified herein, along with the provisions in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 of the Non-Competition Agreement.   
    
  25.  This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by both parties, provided that the Company may amend this Agreement from time to time without Employee s consent to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to effect compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations and interpretations thereunder, which amendments may result in a reduction of benefits provided hereunder and/or other unfavorable changes to Employee.

  WHEREAS, the Company and Employee are terminating the Change of Control Agreement by mutual agreement pursuant to the Termination of Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreement (the  Termination Agreement ) being entered into concurrently herewith, and desire and intend that this Agreement shall replace and supersede the Change of Control Agreement in its entirety; and  
  WHEREAS, the Company and Employee acknowledge and agree that this Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Termination Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by the Company and the Employee; 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1.      Restrictions on Competition and Solicitation  .  While the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the date of Employee's termination of employment with the Company for any reason Employee will not, directly or indirectly, expressly or tacitly, for himself/herself or on behalf of any entity conducting business anywhere in the Restricted Territory (as defined below): (i) act in any capacity for any business in which his/her duties at or for such business include oversight of or actual involvement in providing services which are competitive with the services or products being provided or which are being produced or developed by the Company, or were under investigation by the Company within the last two (2) years prior to the end of Employee's employment with the Company, (ii) recruit investors on behalf of an entity which engages in activities which are competitive with the services or products being provided or which are being produced or developed by the Company, or were under investigation by the Company within the last two (2) years prior to the end of Employee's employment with the Company, or (iii) become employed by such an entity in any capacity which would require Employee to carry out, in whole or in part, the duties Employee has performed for the Company which are competitive with the services or products being provided or which are being produced or developed by the Company, or were under active investigation by the Company within the last two (2) years prior to the end of Employee's employment with the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than) 1% of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  This covenant shall apply to any services, products or businesses under investigation by the Company within the last two (2) years prior to the end of Employee's employment with the Company only to the extent that Employee acquired or was privy to confidential information regarding such services, products or businesses.  Employee acknowledges that this restriction will prevent Employee from acting in any of the foregoing capacities for any competing entity operating or conducting business within the Restricted Territory and that this scope is reasonable in light of the business of the Company. 
  Restricted Territory shall mean (i) the entire geographic location of any natural gas and oil play in which the Company owns, operates or has contractual rights to purchase natural gas-related assets (other than commodity trading rights and pipeline capacity contracts on non-affiliated or third-party pipelines), including but not limited to, storage facilities, interstate pipelines, intrastate pipelines, intrastate distribution facilities, liquefied natural gas facilities, propane-air facilities or other peaking facilities, and/or processing or fractionation facilities; or (ii) the entire geographic location of any natural gas and oil play in which the Company owns proved, developed and/or undeveloped natural gas and/or oil reserves and/or conducts natural gas or oil exploration and production activities of any kind; or (iii) the entire geographic location of any natural gas and oil play in which the Company has decided to make or has made an offer to purchase or lease assets for the purpose of conducting any of the business activities described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above within the six (6) month period immediately preceding the end of the Employee s employment with the Company provided that Employee had actual knowledge of the offer or decision to make an offer prior to Employee s separation from the Company.  For geographic locations of natural gas and oil plays, refer to the maps produced by the United States Energy Information Administration located at www.eia.gov/maps.

  While Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of thirty-six (36) months after the date of Employee's termination of employment with the Company for any reason, Employee shall not (directly or indirectly) on his/her own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity solicit or induce, or cause any other person or entity to solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any employee, consultant,     vendor or independent contractor to leave the employ of or engagement by the Company or its successors, assigns or affiliates, or to violate the terms of their contracts with the Company. 
  2.      Confidentiality of Information and Nondisclosure  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that his/her employment by the Company necessarily involves his/her knowledge of and access to confidential and proprietary information pertaining to the business of the Company.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and for as long as the information remains confidential after the termination of Employee's employment, he/she will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written authority of the Company, unless directed by applicable legal authority having jurisdiction over Employee, disclose to or use, or knowingly permit to be so disclosed or used, for the benefit of himself/herself, any person, corporation or other entity other than the Company, (i) any information concerning any financial matters, employees of the Company, customer relationships, competitive status, supplier matters, internal organizational matters, current or future plans, or other business affairs of or relating to the Company, (ii) any management, operational, trade, technical or other secrets or any other proprietary information or other data of the Company, or (iii) any other information related to the Company which has not been published and is not generally known outside of the Company.

Nothing in this Section 2 prohibits Employee from reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state, or local law or regulation. 
  3.      Severance Benefit  .  If the Employee s employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause (as defined below) or if the Employee terminates his/her

  (b)  A lump sum payment payable within 60 days following Employee s termination date equal to two times     the average annual incentive (bonus) payment earned by the Employee under the Company s applicable Short-Term Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) for the three (3) full years prior to Employee s termination date;  
  (c)  A lump sum payment payable within 60 days following Employee s termination date equal to the product of (i) twelve (12) and (ii) 100% of the then-current Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 monthly rate for family coverage; 
  (d)  A lump sum payment payable within 60 days following Employee s termination date equal to $200,000; 
  (e)  Subject to Section 14 of this Agreement, all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other time-vesting equity awards granted to Employee under the 2009 EQT Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the  2009 LTIP ), the EQT Corporation 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, and including any successor plan thereto, the  2014 LTIP ), the EQT Midstream Services, LLC 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, and including any successor plan thereto, the  2012 LTIP ), the EQT GP Services, LLC 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, and including any successor plan thereto, the  2015 LTIP ), and any other long-term incentive plan of the Company (the 2009 LTIP, the 2014 LTIP, the 2012 LTIP, the 2015 LTIP and any other long-term incentive plan of the Company are, collectively, the  LTIPs ) shall immediately become vested and exercisable in full and/or all restrictions on such awards shall lapse (for avoidance of doubt, this provision shall supersede any provision to the contrary contained in any award agreement or program); and 
  (f)  Subject to Section 14 of this Agreement, all performance-based equity awards granted to Employee by the Company under the LTIPs shall     remain outstanding and shall be earned, if at all, based on actual performance through the end of the performance period as if Employee s employment had not been terminated (for avoidance of doubt, this provision shall supersede any provision to the contrary contained in any award agreement or program). 
  The payments provided under this Section 3 shall be subject to applicable tax and payroll withholdings, and shall be in addition to any payments and/or benefits to which the Employee would otherwise be entitled under the EQT Corporation Severance Pay Plan (as amended from time to time).  The Company s obligation to provide the payments and benefits under this Section 3 shall be contingent upon the following: 
  (a)  Employee s execution of a release of claims in a form acceptable to the Company; and 
  4 

(b)  Employee s compliance with his/her obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to, Employee s obligations set forth in Sections 1 and 2 (the  Restrictive Covenants ). 
  Solely for purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  as a reason for the Employee s termination of employment shall mean: (i) Employee s conviction of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude or fraud or Employee having committed fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement in connection with the performance of his/her duties; (ii) Employee s willful and repeated failures to substantially perform assigned duties; or (iii) Employee s violation of any provision of a written employment-related agreement between Employee and the Company or express significant policies of the Company.  If the Company terminates Employee s employment for Cause, the Company shall give Employee written notice setting forth the reason for his/her termination not later than 30 days after such termination.

A termination by Employee shall not constitute termination for Good Reason unless Employee first delivers to the General Counsel of the Company written notice: (i) stating that Employee intends to resign for Good Reason pursuant to this Agreement; and (ii) setting forth with specificity the occurrence deemed to give rise to a right to terminate for Good Reason (which notice must be given no later than 90 days after the initial occurrence of such event).  The Company shall have a reasonable period of time (not less than 30 days after receipt of Employee s written notice that Employee is resigning for Good Reason) to take action to correct, rescind or substantially reverse the occurrence supporting termination for Good Reason as identified by Employee.  Failure by the Company to act or respond to the written notice shall not be deemed to be an admission that Good Reason exists. 
  4.      Severability and Modification of Covenants  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that each of the Restrictive Covenants is reasonable and valid in time and scope and in all other respects.  The parties agree that it is their intention that the Restrictive Covenants be enforced in accordance with their terms to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Each of the Restrictive Covenants shall be considered and construed as a separate and independent covenant.  Should any part or provision of any of the Restrictive Covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement or such Restrictive Covenant.  If any of the provisions of the Restrictive Covenants should ever be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the scope permitted by the applicable law, such provision or provisions shall be automatically modified to such lesser scope as such court may deem just and proper for the reasonable protection of the Company s legitimate business interests and may be enforced by the Company to that extent in the manner described above and all other provisions of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable.

  6.      Injunctive Relief and Attorneys  Fees  .  The Employee stipulates and agrees that any breach of the Restrictive Covenants by the Employee will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain, and that the Company could not be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in an action at law.  For these reasons, the Company shall have the right, without the need to post bond or prove actual damages, to obtain such preliminary, temporary or permanent injunctions, orders or decrees as may be necessary to protect the Company against, or on account of, any breach by the Employee of the Restrictive Covenants.  In the event the Company obtains any such injunction, order, decree or other relief, in law or in equity, the duration of any violation of Section 1 shall be added to the applicable restricted period specified in Section 1.  Employee understands and agrees that, if the parties become involved in a lawsuit regarding the enforcement of the Restrictive Covenants and if the Company prevails in such legal action, the Company will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy, to recover from Employee its reasonable costs and attorneys  fees incurred in enforcing such covenants.  The Company s ability to enforce its rights under the Restrictive Covenants or applicable law against Employee shall not be impaired in any way by the existence of a claim or cause of action on the part of Employee based on, or arising out of, this Agreement or any other event or transaction arising out of the employment relationship. 
  7.      Binding Agreement  .  This Agreement (including the Restrictive Covenants) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. 
  8.      Employment at Will  .  Employee shall be employed at will and for no definite term.  This means that either party may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any or no reason. 
  9.      Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Status  .  As part of the Original Agreement, Employee elected to participate in the  Executive Alternative Work Arrangement  program upon Employee s voluntary discontinuance of full-time status.  The Executive Alternative Work Arrangement classification will be automatically assigned to Employee if and when Employee incurs a termination of employment that meets each of the following conditions (an  Eligible Termination ): (a) Employee s employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause   or   Employee gives the Company (delivered to the Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer) at least 90 days  advance written notice of Employee s intention to discontinue employment, (b) Employee is a board-designated executive officer in good standing with EQT Corporation as of the time of his/her termination of employment, and (c) Employee s employment shall not have been terminated by Employee for Good Reason.  The terms and conditions of Employee s Executive Alternative Work 
  6  

Arrangement, which were set forth in an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement attached as Exhibit A to the Original Agreement, are being revised and updated currently herewith, and are set forth in the form of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.  Employee agrees to execute an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement, in a form substantially similar to the one attached hereto as Exhibit A, within 90 days prior to Employee s relinquishment of full-time status, which agreement will become effective automatically on the day following Employee s Eligible Termination.  Without limiting the foregoing, Employee agrees that he/she will not be eligible for the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement, including the post-employment benefits described therein if Employee s termination of employment is not an Eligible Termination.  
  10.      Applicable Law; Exclusive Forum Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction  .  The Company and Employee agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles.  Except to the extent that a dispute is required to be submitted to arbitration as set forth in Section 11 below, Employee agrees that the exclusive forum for any action to enforce this Agreement, as well as any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement, shall be the state courts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania or the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh Division.  With respect to any such court action, Employee hereby (a) irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to service of process; (c) consents to venue; and (d) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction, service of process, or venue.  Both parties hereto further agree that such courts are convenient forums for any dispute that may arise herefrom and that neither party shall raise as a defense that such courts are not convenient forums.   
  11.      Agreement to Arbitrate  .  Employee and the Company agree that any controversy, claim, or dispute between Employee and the Company arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, or arising out of any matter relating to the Employee s employment with the Company or the termination thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, shall be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the  Arbitration Panel ).  The Company and Employee shall each select one arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators (the  Commercial Panel ), and the AAA shall select a third arbitrator from the Commercial Panel.  The Arbitration Panel shall render a reasoned opinion in writing in support of its decision.  Any award rendered by the Arbitration Panel shall be final, binding, and confidential as between the parties.  Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, in the event that Employee breaches or threatens to breach any of Employee s obligations under the Restrictive Covenants, the Company shall have the right to file an action in one of the courts specified in Section 10 above seeking temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief to enforce Employee s obligations under the Restrictive Covenants.

12.      Notification of Subsequent Employment  .    Employee shall upon termination of his/her employment with the Company, as soon as practicable and for the length of the non-competition period described in Section 1 above, notify the Company: (i) of the name, address and nature of the business of his/her new employer; (ii) if self-employed, of the name, address and nature of his/her new business; (iii) that he/she has not yet secured new employment; and (iv) each time his/her employment status changes.  In addition, Employee shall notify any prospective employer that this Agreement exists and shall provide a copy of this Agreement to the prospective employer prior to beginning employment with that prospective employer.  Any notice provided under this Section 12 (or otherwise under this Agreement) shall be in writing directed to the General Counsel, EQT Corporation, 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-3111.  
  13.      Mandatory Reduction of Payments in Certain Events  . 
  (a)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (such benefits, payments or distributions are hereinafter referred to as  Payments ) would, if paid, be subject to the excise tax (the  Excise Tax ) imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), then, prior to the making of any Payments to the Employee, a calculation shall be made comparing (i) the net after-tax benefit to the Employee of the Payments after payment by the Employee of the Excise Tax, to (ii) the net after-tax benefit to the Employee if the Payments had been limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax.  If the amount calculated under (i) above is less than the amount calculated under (ii) above, then the Payments shall be limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax (the  Reduced Amount ).  The reduction of the Payments due hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing cash Payments and then, to the extent necessary, reducing those Payments having the next highest ratio of Parachute Value to actual present value of such Payments as of the date of the change in control transaction, as determined by the Determination Firm (as defined in Section 13(b) below).  For purposes of this Section 13, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.  For purposes of this Section 13, the  Parachute Value  of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the change in control transaction of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a  parachute payment  under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Determination Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.   
  (b)    All determinations required to be made under this Section 13, including whether an Excise Tax would otherwise be imposed, whether the Payments shall be reduced, the amount of the Reduced Amount, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm or compensation consulting firm mutually acceptable to the Company and the Employee (the  Determination Firm ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Employee within 15 business days after the receipt of notice from the Employee that a Payment is due to be made, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  All fees and expenses of the Determination Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any determination by the Determination Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Employee.  As a result of  
  8 

the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Determination Firm hereunder, it is possible that Payments which the Employee was entitled to, but did not receive pursuant to Section 13(a), could have been made without the imposition of the Excise Tax ( Underpayment ), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In such event, the Determination Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee but no later than March 15 of the year after the year in which the Underpayment is determined to exist, which is when the legally binding right to such Underpayment arises.   
  (c)    In the event that the provisions of Code Section 280G and 4999 or any successor provisions are repealed without succession, this Section 13 shall be of no further force or effect. 
  14.      Internal Revenue Code Section 409A  .   
  (a)      General  .  This Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in a manner so that any amount or benefit payable hereunder shall be paid or provided in a manner that is either exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance and Treasury Regulations issued thereunder. Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed.  Neither the Company, nor its directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by Employee as a result of the application of Section 409A of the Code. 
  (b)      Separation from Service  .  For purposes of the Agreement, the term  termination,  when used in the context of a condition to, or the timing of, a payment hereunder, shall be interpreted to mean a  separation from service  as such term is used in Section 409A of the Code.  
  (c)      Six-Month Delay in Certain Circumstances  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt  deferred compensation  for purposes of Section 409A of the Code ( Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation ) would otherwise be payable or distributable under this Agreement by reason of Employee s separation from service during a period in which Employee is a Specified Employee (as defined below), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by the Company under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes):  
  (i) the amount of such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following Employee s separation from service will be accumulated through and paid or provided on the first day of the seventh month following Employee s separation from service (or, if Employee dies during such period, within thirty (30) days after Employee s death) (in either case, the  Required Delay Period  and 
  9 

(ii) the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume at the end of the Required Delay Period. 
  For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Specified Employee  has the meaning given such term in Code Section 409A and the final regulations thereunder. 
  (d)      Timing of Release of Claims  .  Whenever in this Agreement a payment or benefit is conditioned on Employee s execution of a release of claims, such release must be executed and all revocation periods shall have expired within sixty (60) days after the date of termination; failing which such payment or benefit shall be forfeited.  If such payment or benefit constitutes Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, and if such 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in the next calendar year, the payment or benefit shall not be made or commence before the second such calendar year, even if the release becomes irrevocable in the first such calendar year.  In other words, Employee is not permitted to influence the calendar year of payment based on the timing of his/her signing of the release. 
  15.      Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements (including the Original Agreement and the Change of Control Agreement) and understandings, oral or written.  This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified, except by a written instrument signed by the parties; provided, however, that the Company may amend this Agreement from time to time without Employee s consent to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to effect compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations and interpretations thereunder, which amendments may result in a reduction of benefits provided hereunder and/or other unfavorable changes to Employee.

EXHIBIT A 
    
  EXECUTIVE ALTERNATIVE WORK ARRANGEMENT EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
    
  This is an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement Employment Agreement ( Agreement ) entered into between EQT Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  EQT  or the  Company ) and Theresa Z. Bone ( Employee ). 
  WHEREAS, Employee is an executive officer of EQT who desires to relinquish that status and discontinue full-time employment with EQT but continue employment with EQT on a part-time basis; and 
  WHEREAS, EQT is interested in continuing to retain the services of Employee on a part-time basis for at least 100 (but no more than 400) hours per year; and  
  WHEREAS, Employee has elected to modify his/her employment status to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement; 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective representations, acknowledgements, and agreements of the parties set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.  The term of this Agreement is for the one-year period commencing on the day after Employee s full-time status with EQT ceases.  During that period, Employee will hold the position of an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employee of EQT.  Employee s status as Executive Alternative Work Arrangement (and this one-year Agreement) will automatically renew annually unless either party terminates this Agreement by written notice to the other not less than 30 days prior to the renewal date.  The automatic annual renewals of this Agreement will cease, however, at the end of five years of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status. 
    
  2.  During each one year period in Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status, Employee is required to provide no less than 100 hours     of service to EQT.  During each one-year period, Employee will also make himself/herself available for up to 300 additional hours of service upon request from the Company.  All such hours of service will occur during the Company s regularly scheduled business hours (unless otherwise agreed by the parties), and no more than fifty (50) hours will be scheduled per month (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). 
    
  3.  Employee shall be paid an hourly rate for Employee s actual services provided under this Agreement.  The hourly rate shall be Employee s annual base salary in effect immediately prior to Employee s change in employee classification to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status divided by 2080.  Employee shall submit monthly time sheets in a form agreed upon by the parties, and Employee will be paid on regularly scheduled payroll dates in accordance with the Company s standard payroll practices following submission of his/her time sheets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that during any one-year period in Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status, EQT requests Employee  

to provide less than 100 hours of service, EQT shall pay Employee for a minimum of 100 hours of service (regardless of the actual number of hours of service), with any remaining amount owed payable on the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the end of the applicable one-year period.  If either party terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof, no additional compensation will be paid to Employee pursuant to this Section 3. 
    
  4.  Employee shall be eligible to continue to participate in the group medical (including prescription drug), dental and vision programs in which Employee participated immediately before the classification change to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement (as such plans might be modified by the Company from time-to-time), but Employee will be required to pay 100% of the Company s premium (or premium equivalent) rates to the carriers (the full active employee premium rates - both the employee portion and the employer portion -  as adjusted year-to-year) for participation in such group insurance programs.  If Employee completes five years of Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status or if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, Employee will be allowed to participate in such group insurance programs at 102% of the then-applicable full active employee premium rates (both the employee portion and the employer portion) until the earlier of:  (i) Employee becomes eligible to receive Medicare benefits and (ii) Employee reaches age 70, even though Employee is no longer employed by EQT.      Employee acknowledges that, to the extent, if at all, the Company s cost to include Employee in the group insurance programs pursuant to this paragraph exceeds the cost paid by the Employee, the benefits provided hereunder may result in taxable income to the Employee.  All amounts required to be paid by Employee pursuant to this paragraph shall be due not later than 30 days after written notice thereof is sent by the Company.  Company may terminate the benefits provided under this Agreement upon 30 days written notice of any failure by Employee to timely perform his/her payment obligation hereunder, unless such failure is earlier cured. 
    
  5.  During the term of this Agreement, Employee will continue to receive service credit for purposes of calculating the value of the Medical Spending Account.   
    
  6.  Employee shall not be eligible to participate in the Company s life insurance and disability insurance programs, 401(k) Plan, ESPP, or any other retirement or welfare benefit programs or perquisites of the Company.  Likewise, Employee shall not receive any paid vacation, paid holidays or car allowance.   
    
  7.  Employee is not eligible to receive bonus payments under any short-term incentive plans of EQT, and is not eligible to receive any new grants under EQT s long-term incentive plans, programs or arrangements. 
    
  8.  Effective not later than the commencement of this Executive Alternative Work Arrangement, Employee shall be deemed to have retired for purposes of measuring vesting and/or post termination exercise periods of all forms of long term incentive awards.  The timing of any payments for such awards will be as provided in the underlying plans, programs or arrangements and is subject to any required six-month delay in payment if Employee is a  
    
  -2- 

specified employee  under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) at the time of Employee s separation from service, with respect to payments made by reason of Employee s separation from service.  Nothing in this paragraph 8, or in paragraph 7, shall prevent (a) the continued vesting of previously granted long-term incentive awards to the extent the award agreement therefore expressly contemplates continued vesting while the recipient serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company or an affiliate or (b) grants of non-employee director awards to an individual solely because such individual serves on the Board of Directors of the Company or an affiliate.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any special vesting and/or payment provisions applicable to Employee s long-term incentive awards pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement between EQT and Employee dated July 29, 2015 (as amended from time to time, the  Non-Competition Agreement ) shall apply and be given effect. 
    
  9.  The Company shall either pay on behalf of Employee or reimburse Employee for the cost of (i) monthly dues for one country club and one dining club (such clubs to be approved by the Company s Chief Executive Officer), and (ii) executive level physicals (currently  gold  level) and related health and wellness services for Employee and Employee s spouse (up to a maximum annual benefit of $15,000), in each case during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof in accordance with and on the dates specified in the Company s policies;   provided, however,   that no such payments or reimbursements shall be made until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code;   provided, further,   that to the extent reimbursed or paid, all reimbursements and payments with respect to expenses incurred within a particular year shall be made no later than the end of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of payments or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year of Employee shall not affect the amount of reimbursable expenses in a different taxable year, and such payments or reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.   
    
  10.  Employee shall continue to have mobile telephone service and reasonable access to the Company s Help Desk during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof; provided, however, if the provision of such service will result in taxable income to Employee, then no such taxable service shall be provided until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.   
    
  11.  Employee shall receive tax, estate and financial planning services from providers approved in advance by the Company during the term of this Agreement or, if the Company terminates the Executive Alternative Work Arrangement prior to the fifth anniversary hereof other than pursuant to paragraph 17 hereof, through the fifth anniversary hereof, in amount not to exceed $15,000 per calendar year, to be paid directly by the Company in accordance with and on  
    
  -3- 

the dates specified in the Company s policies;   provided, however,   that no such payments or reimbursements shall be made until the first day following the six-month anniversary of Employee s separation from service if Employee is a specified employee at the time of separation from service, all within the meaning of Section 409A of Code;   provided, further,   that to the extent reimbursed or paid, all reimbursements and payments with respect to expenses incurred within a particular year shall be made no later than the end of Employee s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.  The amount of payments or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year of Employee shall not affect the amount of payments or reimbursable expenses in a different taxable year, and such payments or reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.   
    
  12.  During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall maintain an ownership level of Company stock equal to not less than one-half of the value last required as a full-time Employee.  In the event that at any time during the term of this Agreement Employee does not maintain the required ownership level, Employee shall promptly notify the Company and increase his or her ownership to at least the required level.  Any failure of Employee to maintain at least the required ownership level for more than three months during the term of this Agreement shall constitute and be deemed to be an immediate termination by Employee of his or her Executive Alternative Work Arrangement.    
    
  13.  This Agreement sets forth all of the payments, benefits, perquisites and entitlements to which Employee shall be entitled upon assuming Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status.  Employee shall not be entitled to receive any gross-up payments for any taxes or other amounts with respect to amounts payable under this Agreement. 
    
  14.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit the Company from modifying any of its employee benefits plans, programs, or policies. 
    
  15.  Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation  .  The covenants as to non-competition and non-solicitation contained in Section 1, and as to notification of subsequent employment in Section 12, in each case of the Non-Competition Agreement shall remain in effect throughout Employee s employment with EQT in Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status and for a period of twenty-four (24) months, in the case of non-competition covenants; twenty-four (24), in the case of non-solicitation covenants relating to customers and prospective customers; and thirty-six (36) months, in the case of non-solicitation covenants relating to employees, consultants, vendors or independent contractors, in each case after the termination of Employee s employment as an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employee.  It is understood and agreed that if Employee s employment as an Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employee terminates for any reason in the midst of any one-year term period as provided under this Agreement (including, without limitation, a termination pursuant to Sections 4, 12 or 17 of this Agreement), the covenants as to non-competition and non-solicitation contained in the Non-Competition Agreement shall remain in effect throughout the remainder of that one-year term and for a period of      twenty-four (24) months, in the case of non-competition covenants, and thirty-six (36) months, in the case of non-solicitation covenants,     months thereafter.  
    
  -4- 

16.  Confidential Information and Non-Disclosure  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee s employment by the Company necessarily involves Employee s knowledge of and access to confidential and proprietary information pertaining to the business of the Company.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that at all times during the term of this Agreement and for as long as the information remains confidential after the termination of Employee's employment, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, without the express written authority of the Company, unless directed by applicable legal authority having jurisdiction over Employee, disclose to or use, or knowingly permit to be so disclosed or used, for the benefit of Employee, any person, corporation or other entity other than the Company, (i) any information concerning any financial matters, employees of the Company, customer relationships, competitive status, supplier matters, internal organizational matters, current or future plans, or other business affairs of or relating to the Company, (ii) any management, operational, trade, technical or other secrets or any other proprietary information or other data of the Company, or (iii) any other information related to the Company which has not been published and is not generally known outside of the Company.  Employee acknowledges that all of the foregoing constitutes confidential and proprietary information, which is the exclusive property of the Company.  Nothing in this Section 16 prohibits Employee from reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state, or local law or regulation. 
    
  17.  EQT may terminate this Agreement and Employee s employment at any time for Cause.  Solely for purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean: (i) Employee s conviction of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude or fraud or Employee having committed fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement in connection with the performance of his/her duties; (ii) Employee s willful and repeated failures to substantially perform assigned duties; or (iii) Employee s violation of any provision of this Agreement or express significant policies of the Company.  If the Company terminates Employee s employment for Cause, the Company shall give Employee written notice setting forth the reason for his/her termination not later than 30 days after such termination. 
    
  18.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event of any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, or arising out of any other matter relating to the Employee's employment with EQT or the termination of such employment, EQT may seek recourse for injunctive relief to the courts having jurisdiction thereof and if any relief other than injunctive relief is sought, EQT and the Employee agree that such underlying controversy, dispute or claim shall be settled by arbitration conducted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in accordance with this Section 18 of this Agreement and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ).  The matter shall be heard and decided, and awards, if any, rendered by a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the  Arbitration Panel ).  EQT and the Employee shall each select one arbitrator from the AAA National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators (the  Commercial Panel ) and AAA shall select a third arbitrator from the Commercial Panel.  Any award rendered by the Arbitration Panel shall be final, binding and confidential as between the parties hereto and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and judgment on the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

19.  EQT shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require Employee to remit to EQT, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including Employee s FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any payment or benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement.  The obligations of EQT under this Agreement will be conditioned on such payment or arrangements and EQT will, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Employee.   
    
  20.  It is understood and agreed that upon Employee s discontinuation of full-time employment and transition to Executive Alternative Work Arrangement employment status hereunder, Employee has no continuing rights under Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement and such section shall have no further force or effect. 
    
  21.  The provisions of this Agreement are severable.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable in any court of law, the parties intend that such provision be construed by such court in a manner to make it enforceable. 
    
  22.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. 
    
  23.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. 
    
  24.  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between EQT and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof (oral or written), including but not limited to Section 3 of the Non-Competition Agreement.  It is understood and agreed, however, that the covenants as to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and nondisclosure contained in Sections 1 and 2 of the Non-Competition Agreement remain in effect as modified herein, along with the provisions in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 12 of the Non-Competition Agreement.   
    
  25.  This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by both parties, provided that the Company may amend this Agreement from time to time without Employee s consent to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to effect compliance with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations and interpretations thereunder, which amendments may result in a reduction of benefits provided hereunder and/or other unfavorable changes to Employee.
