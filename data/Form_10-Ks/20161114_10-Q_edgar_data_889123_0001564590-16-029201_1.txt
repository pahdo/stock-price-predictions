  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND GENERAL  
 In the opinion of the general partners, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial information included therein. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the partnership s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operations results to be expected for the full year. 
 Redwood Mortgage Investors VIII, a California Limited Partnership (we, RMI VIII or the partnership), was formed in 1993 to engage in business as a mortgage lender and investor by making and holding-for-investment mortgage loans secured by California real estate, primarily through first and second deeds of trust. 
 The partnership is externally managed. The general partners are Redwood Mortgage Corp. (RMC) and Michael R. Burwell (Burwell), an individual. Burwell is the president and majority shareholder of RMC through his holdings and beneficial interests in certain trusts. The general partners are solely responsible for managing the business and affairs of the partnership, subject to the voting rights of the limited partners on specified matters. Any one of the general partners acting alone has the power and authority to act for and bind the partnership. The mortgage loans the partnership invests in are arranged and are generally serviced by RMC. 
 The rights, duties and powers of the general and limited partners of the partnership are governed by the limited partnership agreement and Sections 15900 et seq. of the California Corporations Code. Partners should refer to the partnership agreement for complete disclosure of its provisions. A majority of the outstanding limited partnership units may, without the permission of the general partners, vote to: (i) terminate the partnership, (ii) amend the limited partnership agreement, (iii) approve or disapprove the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the partnership, and (iv) remove or replace one or all of the general partners. The approval of all the limited partners is required to elect a new general partner to continue the partnership business where there is no remaining general partner after a general partner ceases to be a general partner other than by removal. The last offering of units of limited partnership interests closed in November 2008. 
 Profits and losses are allocated among the limited partners according to their respective capital accounts after one percent (1%) of profits and losses are allocated to the general partners. The monthly results are subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of quarterly and year-end accounting and reporting. Federal and state income taxes are the obligation of the partners, if and when taxes apply, other than the annual California franchise tax, and any California LLC cash receipts taxes paid by the partnership and its subsidiaries. 
 The ongoing sources of funds for loans are the proceeds from (1) earnings retained (i.e. not distributed) in partners  capital accounts, (2) loan payoffs, (3) borrowers  monthly principal and interest payments, (4) REO sales, and, (5) to a lesser degree and, if obtained, a line of credit.  Cash generated from loan payoffs and borrower payments of principal and interest is used for operating expenses, income distributions to partners, and unit liquidations. The cash flow, if any, in excess of these uses is to be re-invested in new loans. 
 Distribution policy 
 At the time of their subscription for units, partners elected to have distributed to them their monthly, quarterly or annual allocation of profits, or to have profits allocated to their capital accounts to be retained by the partnership to compound.  Subject to certain limitations, those electing compounding may subsequently change their election. A partner s election to receive cash distributions is irrevocable. 
 Beginning in September 2015, the distributions annual rate increased to two and one-half percent (2.5%) from two percent (2%).

 September 30, 2016 (unaudited) 
   
    Liquidity, capital withdrawals and early withdrawals  
 There is no established public trading and/or secondary market for the units, and none is expected to develop. There are substantial restrictions on transferability of units. To provide liquidity to limited partners, the partnership agreement provides that limited partners in the partnership for the minimum five-year period may withdraw all or a portion of their capital accounts in twenty (20) quarterly installments or longer, as determined by the general partners in light of partnership cash flow, beginning the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the notice of withdrawal is given.  A limited partner may liquidate all or part of the limited partner s capital account in four (4) quarterly installments beginning on the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the notice of withdrawal is given, subject to a ten percent (10%) early withdrawal penalty applicable to any sums withdrawn prior to the time when such sums could have been withdrawn without penalty.  There is also a limited right of liquidation for an investor s heirs upon an investor s death. 
 The partnership does not establish a reserve from which to fund withdrawals and, accordingly, the partnership s capacity to return a limited partner s capital is restricted by the availability of partnership cash. No more than twenty percent (20%) of the total limited partners  capital account balances at the beginning of any year, may be liquidated during any calendar year. 
 Lending and investment guidelines, objectives and criteria 
 Generally, interest rates on the partnership s mortgage loans are not affected by market movements in interest rates. The partnership s loans generally have shorter maturity terms than typical mortgages.  In the event a borrower is unable to repay in full the principal owing on the loan at maturity, the partnership may consider extending the term through a loan modification or may foreclose and take back the property for sale. 
 The partnership s primary investment objectives are to: 

Yield a high rate of return from mortgage lending, and,     

Preserve and protect the partners  capital.     

 The partnership generally funds loans: 

Having monthly payments of interest only or of principal and interest at fixed rates, calculated on a 30-year amortization basis, and,     

Having maturities of 5 years or less, not to exceed 15 years.     

 The cash flow and the income generated by the real property securing the loan factor into the credit decisions, as does the general creditworthiness, experience and reputation of the borrower. However, for loans secured by real property, other than owner-occupied personal residences, such considerations are subordinate to a determination that the value of the real property is sufficient, in and of itself, as a source of repayment. The amount of the partnership s loan combined with the outstanding debt and claims secured by a senior deed of trust on the real property, if any, generally is not to exceed a percentage of the appraised value of the property (the  loan to value ratio , or LTV) specified in the lending guidelines. 
 Term of the partnership 
 The term of the partnership will continue until 2032, unless sooner terminated as provided in the limited partnership agreement.

    NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 Basis of presentation 
 The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). 
 The partnership s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries (consisting of single-member limited liability companies representing ownership in a single real property asset), and, in 2015, its 72.5%-owned subsidiary (a single-asset limited liability company which is owned with affiliates and whose single asset was a development property in San Francisco County). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 Management estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Such estimates relate principally to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including, when applicable, the valuation of impaired loans (which itself requires determining the fair value of the collateral), and the valuation of real estate held for sale and held as investment, at acquisition and subsequently. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
 Fair value estimates 
 GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact. 
 Fair values of assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair value hierarchy established in GAAP.  The hierarchy is comprised of three levels of inputs to be used. 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the partnership has the ability to access at the measurement date.  An active market is a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.     

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, in active markets and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or inputs derived from or corroborated by market data.     

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the partnership s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances and may include the partnership s own data.     

 Collateral fair values are reviewed quarterly and the protective equity for each loan is computed. As used herein,  protective equity  is the arithmetic difference between the fair value of the collateral, net of any senior liens, and the loan balance, where  loan balance  is the sum of the unpaid principal, advances and the recorded interest thereon. This computation is done for each loan (whether impaired or performing), and while loans secured by collateral of similar property type are grouped, there is enough distinction and variation in the collateral that a loan-by-loan, collateral-by-collateral analysis is appropriate.

    The fair value of the collateral is determined by exercise of judgment based on management s experience informed by appraisals (by licensed appraisers), brokers  opinion of values, and publicly availabl  e information on in-market transactions. Appraisals of commercial real property generally present three approaches to estimating value:  1) market comparables or sales approach; 2) cost to replace; and 3) capitalized cash flows or investment approach. Thes  e approaches may or may not result in a common, single value. The market-comparables approach may yield several different values depending on certain basic assumptions, such as, determining highest and best use (which may or may not be the current use); de  termining the condition (e.g. as-is, when-completed, or for land when-entitled); and determining the unit of value (e.g. as a series of individual unit sales or as a bulk disposition).  
 Management has the requisite familiarity with the markets it lends in generally and of the properties lent on specifically to analyze sales-comparables and assess their suitability and/or applicability. Management is acquainted with market participants   investors, developers, brokers, lenders   that are useful, relevant secondary sources of data and information regarding valuation and valuation variability. These secondary sources may have familiarity with and perspectives on pending transactions, successful strategies to optimize value, and the history and details of specific properties   on and off the market   that enhance the process and analysis that is particularly and principally germane to establishing value in distressed markets and/or property types. 
 Cash, in banks 
 The partnership considers all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, certain partnership cash balances in banks may at times exceed federally insured limits. 
 Loans and interest income 
 Loans generally are stated at the unpaid principal balance (principal). Management has discretion to pay amounts (advances) to third parties on behalf of borrowers to protect the partnership s interest in the loan. Advances include, but are not limited to, the payment of interest and principal on a senior lien to prevent foreclosure by the senior lien holder, property taxes, insurance premiums, and attorney fees. Advances generally are stated at the amounts paid out on the borrower s behalf and any accrued interest on amounts paid out, until repaid by the borrower. 
 The partnership may fund a specific loan origination net of an interest reserve to insure timely interest payments at the inception (one to two years) of the loan. As monthly interest payments become due, the partnership funds the payments into the affiliated trust account. 
 If based upon current information and events, it is probable the partnership will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, then a loan may be designated as impaired. Impaired loans are included in management s periodic analysis of recoverability. If a valuation allowance has been established on an impaired loan, any subsequent payments on impaired loans are applied to late fees and then to reduce first the accrued interest, then advances, and then unpaid principal. 
 From time to time, the partnership negotiates and enters into loan modifications with borrowers whose loans are delinquent. In the normal course of the partnership s operations, loans that mature may be renewed at then current market rates and terms for new loans. Such renewals are not designated as impaired, unless the renewed loan was previously designated as impaired. 
 Interest is accrued daily based on the unpaid principal balance of the loans. An impaired loan continues to accrue as long as the loan is in the process of collection and is considered to be well-secured. Loans are placed on non-accrual status at the earlier of management s determination that the primary source of repayment will come from the foreclosure and subsequent sale of the collateral securing the loan (which usually occurs when a notice of sale is filed) or when the loan is no longer considered well-secured. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued; however, previously recorded interest is not reversed. A loan may return to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.

    Allowance for loan losses  
 Loans and the related accrued interest and advances are analyzed on a periodic basis for ultimate recoverability. Delinquencies are identified and followed as part of the loan system. Delinquencies are determined based upon contractual terms. For impaired loans, a provision is made for loan losses to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount considered by management to be adequate, with due consideration to collateral values, such that the net carrying amount (unpaid principal balance, plus advances, plus accrued interest less the specific allowance) is reduced to the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or, if a loan is collateral dependent, to the estimated fair value of the related collateral, net of any senior loans, and net of any costs to sell in arriving at net realizable value if planned disposition of the asset securing a loan is by way of sale. 
 The fair value estimates of the related collateral are derived from information available in the real estate markets including similar property, and may require the experience and judgment of third parties such as commercial real estate appraisers and brokers. 
 Loans determined not to be individually impaired are grouped by the property type of the underlying collateral, and for each loan and for the total by property type, the amount of protective equity or amount of exposure to loss is computed. 
 Based on its knowledge of the borrowers and their historical (and expected) performance, and the exposure to loss as indicated in the analysis, management estimates an appropriate reserve by property type for probable credit losses in the portfolio. Because the partnership is an asset-based lender, except as to owner-occupied residences, and because specific regions, neighborhoods and even properties within the same neighborhoods, vary significantly as to real estate values and transaction activity, general market trends, which may be indicative of a change in the risk of a loss, and a borrower s creditworthiness are secondary to the condition of the property, the property type and the neighborhood/region in which the property is located, and do not enter substantially into the determination of the amount of the non-specific (i.e. general) reserves. 
 The partnership charges off uncollectible loans and related receivables directly to the allowance account once it is determined the full amount is not collectible. 
 Real estate owned (REO) 
 Real estate owned (REO) is property acquired in full or partial settlement of loan obligations generally through foreclosure, and is recorded at acquisition at the lower of the amount owed on the loan (legal basis), plus any senior indebtedness, or at the property s net realizable value, which is the fair value less estimated costs to sell, as applicable. The fair value estimates are derived from information available in the real estate markets, including similar property, and often require the experience and judgment of third parties such as commercial real estate appraisers and brokers. The estimates figure materially in calculating the value of the property at acquisition, the level of charge to the allowance for loan losses and any subsequent valuation reserves. After acquisition, costs incurred relating to the development and improvement of property are capitalized to the extent they do not cause the recorded value to exceed the net realizable value, whereas costs relating to holding and disposition of the property are expensed as incurred. After acquisition, REO is analyzed periodically for changes in fair values and any subsequent write down is charged to operations expense. Any recovery in the fair value subsequent to such a write down is recorded, not to exceed the value recorded at acquisition. Recognition of gains on the sale of real estate is dependent upon the transaction meeting certain criteria related to the nature of the property and the terms of the sale, including potential seller financing. 
 Rental income/depreciation 
 Rental income is recognized when earned in accordance with the lease agreement. For commercial leases, the costs associated with originating the lease are amortized over the lease term. Residential lease terms generally range from month-to-month to one-year, and the expenses of originating the lease are expensed as incurred. Real estate owned that is designated held for sale is not depreciated. Real estate that was designated held for investment, and rented was depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the property. 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
 On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) Financial Instruments   Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. 
 11 
 
 REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII,

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 (unaudited) 
   
    ASU   2016-13 introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including loans. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and provides for a simplified   accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  ASU 2016-13 s approach, referred to as the current expected credit losses (CECL) model, applies to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measur  ed at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, loan commitments, financial guarantees, and net investments in leases, as well as reinsurance and trade receivables. Upon initi  al recognition of the exposure, the CECL model requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses (ECL) should consider historical information, current infor  mation, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments.  ASU 2016-13 does not prescribe a specific method to make the estimate so its   application will require significant judgment  .  
 Generally, the initial estimate of the ECL and subsequent changes in the estimate will be reported in current earnings. The ECL will be recorded through an allowance for loan losses (ALL) in the statement of financial position. 
 ASU 2016-13 will be effective for SEC filers in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. 
 The partnership is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the credit analytics and other processes used in establishing the ALL.  The initial   and preliminary conclusion   is that, because RMI VIII is a real estate based lender, relying primarily on low LTV s/significant protective equity in making the lending decision, the impact on reported financial position and results of operations will not be material to the financial position or results from operations of the partnership. 
   
  NOTE 3   GENERAL PARTNERS AND OTHER RELATED PARTIES  
 The general partners are entitled to one percent (1%) of the profits and losses, which amounted to approximately $17,000 and $19,000 for the three months ended, and $43,000 and $60,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Beginning with calendar year 2010, and continuing until January 1, 2020, RMC assigned its right to two-thirds of one percent (0.66%) of profits and losses to Burwell in exchange for Burwell assuming one hundred percent (100%) of the general partners  equity deficit. 
 Formation loan/Commissions paid to broker-dealers 
 Commissions to broker-dealers (B/D sales commissions) for sales of limited partnership interests were paid by RMC and were not paid directly by the partnership out of offering proceeds.  Instead, the partnership advanced to RMC amounts sufficient to pay the B/D sales commissions and premiums paid to partners in connection with unsolicited orders up to seven percent (7%) of offering proceeds.  The receivable arising from the advances is unsecured, and non-interest bearing and is referred to as the  formation loan.  If the general partners are removed and RMC is no longer receiving payments for services rendered, the formation loan is forgiven, per the terms of the partnership agreement. 
 The formation loan transactions are summarized in the following table at nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in thousands).

    The scheduled payments on the formation loan are presented in the following table ($ in thousands).  

The loan brokerage commissions on the mortgage loans originated for RMI VIII are the primary source of the repayments made by RMC for the formation loan. 
  The following commissions and fees are paid by borrowers directly to RMC.  
 - Brokerage commissions, loan originations 
 In connection with the review, selection, evaluation, negotiation and extension of loans, the general partners may collect loan brokerage commissions (points) limited to an amount not to exceed 4% of the total partnership assets per year. The loan brokerage commissions are paid by borrowers, and thus, are not an expense of the partnership. Loan brokerage commissions paid to RMC by borrowers were $229,510 and $71,045, for the three months ended, and $1,117,871 and $515,702 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 - Other fees 
 The partnership agreement provides for other fees such as reconveyance, mortgage assumption and mortgage extension fees. Such fees are incurred by borrowers and are paid to RMC. Other fees totaled $20,052 and $8,778, for the three months ended, and $71,811 and $53,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  The following commissions and fees are paid by the partnership to RMC.  
 - Mortgage servicing fees 
 RMC earns mortgage servicing fees of up to 1.5% annually of the unpaid principal balance of the loan portfolio.  The mortgage servicing fees are accrued monthly on all loans.  Remittance to RMC is made monthly unless the loan has been assigned a specific loss reserve, at which point remittance is deferred until the specific loss reserve is no longer required, or the property has been acquired by the partnership. 
 Mortgage servicing fees paid to RMC were approximately $348,000 and $255,000 for the three months ended, and $875,000 and $832,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  No mortgage servicing fees were waived during any period reported. 
 - Asset management fees 
 The general partners receive monthly fees for managing the partnership s loan portfolio and operations of up to 1/32 of 1% of the  net asset value  (3/8 of 1% annually). 
 Asset management fees were approximately $167,000 and $181,000 for the three months ended, and $515,000 and $548,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No asset management fees were waived during any period reported.

NOTE 6   FAIR VALUE  
 The partnership does not record loans, REO or mortgages payable at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 The recorded amount of the performing loans (i.e., the loan balance) is deemed to approximate the fair value, as is the loan balance of loans designated impaired for which a specific reserve has not been recorded (i.e., the loan is well collateralized, such that the collection of the amount owed is assured, including foregone interest, if any). 
 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are listed below. 
 - Loans designated impaired (i.e., that are collateral dependent with a specific reserve) 
 - REO for which a valuation reserve has been recorded 
 - REO acquired through foreclosure during the year

 The dollar amount presented is net of the fair value of the property at acquisition of the REO and the principal and interest owing on the first mortgage assumed of approximately $926,000. The mortgage was paid off in June 2016.    

The following methods and assumptions are used when estimating fair value. 

(a)   
 
  Secured loans, performing (i.e., not designated as impaired)  (Level 2)  Each loan is reviewed for its delinquency, protective equity (LTV) adjusted for the most recent valuation of the underlying collateral, remaining term to maturity, borrower s payment history and other factors.  Also considered is the limited resale market for the loans. Most companies or individuals making similar loans as the partnership intend to hold the loans until maturity as the average contractual term of the loans (and the historical experience of the time the loan is outstanding due to pre-payments) is shorter than conventional mortgages.  Furthermore, there are no prepayment penalties to be collected and any loan buyers would be unwilling to risk paying above par. Due to these factors, sales of the loans are infrequent, and an active market does not exist.    

(b)   
 
  Secured loans, designated impaired (Level 2)    Secured Loans designated impaired are deemed collateral dependent, and the fair value of the loan is the lesser of the fair value of the collateral or the enforceable amount owing under the note. The fair value of the collateral is determined by exercise of judgment based on management s experience informed by appraisals (by licensed appraisers), brokers  opinion of values and publicly available information on in-market transactions Level 2 inputs.    

 The following methods are used depending upon the property type of the collateral of the secured loans. 
 Single family    Management s preferred method for determining the fair market value of its single-family residential assets is the sale comparison (sale comp) method. Management primarily obtains sale comps through its subscription to the RealQuest service, but also uses free online services such as Zillow.com and other available resources to supplement this data. Sale comps are reviewed for similarity to the subject property, examining features such as proximity to subject, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, sale date, condition and year built.  
 If applicable sale comps are not available or deemed unreliable, management will seek additional information in the form of brokers  opinions of value or appraisals. 
 Multi-family residential    The partnership s multi-family residential assets consist of multiple owned units at fractured condominium projects and wholly owned apartment complexes with condominium overlays. Management s fair market value analysis compares the aggregate retail value of the units as for-sale condominiums against the asset s value as an income-producing rental property in determining its most favorable market.  
 Management s preferred method for determining the aggregate retail value of its multifamily units is the sale comparison method for the individual condominium units. Management primarily obtains sale comps via its subscription to the RealQuest service, but also uses free online services such as Zillow.com to supplement this data. Sale comps are reviewed for similarity to the subject property, examining features such as proximity to subject, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, sale date, condition, amenities and year built. For fractured condominium projects, sales of units within the same community are preferred. 
 23 
 
 REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII, 
 A California Limited Partnership 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 (unaudited) 
   
    Management compiles the list of the most relevant sale comps and derives an average price per square foot, which is then applied to the average square footage of partnership-owned units at the subject property to determine the average pr  ice per unit and the gross square footage of all partnership units to determine the aggregate retail value of the units as for-sale condominiums.  
 Where adequate sale comps are not available, management will seek additional information in the form of brokers  opinions of value or appraisals. 
 Management s preferred method for valuing its multifamily assets as income-producing rental operations is the direct capitalization method when rental operations are consistent and rental income and expenses have been normalized. In order to determine market capitalization rates (cap rates), management refers to published data from reliable third-party sources such as the CBRE Cap Rate Survey. Management then applies the appropriate cap rate to the property s most recent available annual net operating income to determine the property s value as an income-producing project. When reliable net operating income information is not available, or the project is under development, or is under-performing to market, management will seek additional information and analysis to determine the cost to improve and the intrinsic fair value. 
 Where such information is available, management may also determine the asset s value as an income-producing rental project via the sale comparison method by comparing the value of similar multifamily assets sold recently. This method typically applies only to wholly owned apartment complexes. 
 Management compares the aggregate retail value to the value as an income-producing rental project to determine the property s current highest and best use/ most favorable market, setting the fair market value accordingly. 
 Commercial buildings    Where commercial rental income information is available, management s preferred method for determining the fair value of its commercial real estate assets is the direct capitalization method. In order to determine cap rates for properties of the same class and location as the subject, management refers to reputable third-party sources such as the CBRE Cap Rate Survey. Management then applies the appropriate cap rate to the subject s most recent available annual net operating income to determine the property s value as an income-producing commercial rental project.  When reliable net operating income information is not available or the project is under development or is under-performing to market, management will seek additional information and analysis to determine the cost to improve and the intrinsic fair value of stabilized properties performing at market, less any cost to improve.  
 Supplementally, and particularly when reliable net operating income is not available or the project is under development, management will seek additional information in the form of a sale comparison analysis (where adequate sale comps are available), brokers  opinion of value, or appraisal. 
 Commercial land    Commercial land has many variations/uses, thus requiring management to employ a variety of methods depending upon the unique characteristics of the subject land. Management may rely on information in the form of a sale comparison analysis (where adequate sales comps are available), brokers  opinion of value or appraisal.  

(c)   
 
 Unsecured loans (Level 3). Unsecured loans are valued at their principal less any discount or loss reserves established by management after taking into account the borrower s creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan.    

(d)   
 
 Mortgages payable (Level 2). The partnership has mortgages payable. The interest rates are deemed to be at market rates for the type and location of the securing property, the length of the mortgage, and the other terms and conditions are deemed to be customary. All of the partnership s mortgages are deemed to be at fair value as they are either, with variable interest rates which have adjusted within the past twelve months, or were refinanced/extended within the past twelve months with terms and conditions deemed customary for the collateral property.

Results of Operations  
 General Economic Conditions - California 
 All of our mortgage loans are secured by California real estate.  Our secured-loan investment activity and the value of the real estate securing our loans is significantly dependent on economic activity and employment conditions in the state.  Wells Fargo s Economics Group periodically provides timely, relevant information and analysis in its commentary and reports regarding California s employment and economic conditions.  Highlights from recently issued reports from Wells Fargo Securities Economics Group are presented below. 
 In the publication  California Employment Conditions  August 2016 (dated September 16, 2016), the Wells Fargo Economics Group notes: 
 California employers added 63,100 net new jobs in August, marking the second largest increase over the past year.  The breakneck pace of hiring brought year-to-year nonfarm employment growth to 2.3 percent, which translates into an annual gain of 378,000 jobs.  Nearly half of last month s increase came from government employment, which added an outsized 27,900 jobs in August, with most of that gain occurring at the local level.  We suspect that August s unusually large rise in public sector payrolls is due to seasonal adjustment quirks surrounding the start of the school year.  Local government payrolls tumbled in July for instance, and have added only 35,500 jobs over the past year. 
 Outside of the surge in government hiring, the jobs picture still looks solid. Private sector payrolls added 35,200 jobs in August and have added 332,800 jobs over the past year.  Hiring in California s important professional, scientific   technical services sector, which includes tech-related professions such as engineering, computer systems design and scientific research ramped up in August.  Payrolls rose by 13,100 on the month, pushing the annual gain over 60,000.  Energy-related industries continued to shed jobs in August, with employment in mining   logging reporting a loss of 400 jobs.  In addition, manufacturers cut 3,400 jobs. Both industries have seen employment declines over the past year. 
 On a regional basis, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale metropolitan area accounted for the bulk of August s gains, as employment rose by 15,300 jobs on the month.  Riverside and Sacramento also reported healthy increases, each seeing payrolls rise by more than 5,000. 
 Recently released data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the first quarter suggests that the Current Employment Statistics (CES), which is reported on a more frequent month-to-month basis, has understated job growth in California s key information sector. The industry captures many tech-related professions, including positions in search portals, software and data processing, as well as occupations in the motion picture industry.  The CES had estimated that information payrolls rose 3.4 percent year-to-year in the first quarter while the QCEW data show an 8.5 percent gain, marking the strongest pace since 2001.  Hiring in the state s sizable motion picture and sound recording industry rose at a staggering 16 percent year-to-year pace in the first quarter according to the QCEW data, much stronger than the CES s 1.9 percent estimate.  Total job growth was also understated for the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas, as the QCEW reported a 3.0 percent and 3.8 percent increase, respectively, versus 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in the CES. 
 In the publication:  California Mid-Year Economic Update  (dated June 23, 2016), the Wells Fargo Economics Group Notes: 
 Newly Released Data Show Stronger GDP Growth in the Golden State   While a few signs of slowing are evident, California s economy remains in the midst of a tremendous run of economic growth. Nonfarm employment growth has averaged nearly three percent over the past three years, and the state s jobless rate has tumbled to 5.2 percent, narrowing the gap to the U.S. rate to just half a percentage point.  California s good fortune has largely been due to the rapid growth of technology, knowledge-based and creative industries. 
 Recently released data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put some solid numbers behind California s recent performance.  Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.1 percent in 2015 to 2.46 trillion,  . Growth slowed during the second half of the year, however, with real GDP rising at 2.7 percent annualized in the fourth quarter and averaging just 1.6 percent during the second half of the year. This past year marked the strongest growth rate since 2004 and was also one of the fastest growth rates of any state, tying Oregon for the largest percentage gain.  California easily outpaced the national average for the fourth consecutive year, as the nation grew at a lesser 2.4 percent growth pace.  California, which accounts for 13.8 percent of national GDP, accounted for 23.8 percent of the nation s growth in 2015. 
 California s world-renown technology sector, which is largely captured in the information and professional, scientific   technical services sectors, continued in the fourth quarter. The two sectors made the most significant contribution to California s real GDP growth, contributing a combined 1.3 percentage points to the 2.7 percent overall annualized growth during the quarter.  Moreover, tech-related growth in California has far outpaced the national average over the past year, with tech output growing by a larger 10.3 percent in the California relative to a 6.0 percent gain nationwide. 
 27 

Housing remains a bright spot in the state s economy, as C  alifornia s burgeoning employment and population growth continues to fuel demand for new homes.  Residential construction activity ramped up in 2015, with single-family permits registering 44,132 units for the year, marking their highest level since 2007.   The multifamily market also continued to thrive, with 53,479 units permitted in 2015. The gains in housing helped boost construction output, which accounted for 0.26 percentage points of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. That said, we expect the pace   of construction to moderate slightly through the balance of this year and in 2017. Multifamily development is set to cool from its breakneck pace and population growth is likely to take a bit of a breather, as residents and would-be residents re-examine th  e costs and the benefits of living in expensive coastal regions in the Bay Area and Southern California.  
 Performance Highlights 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income available to limited partners as a percent of Limited Partners  capital   average daily balance was 3.9% and 3.2% (annualized), respectively. Distributions to those limited partners electing periodic distributions was 2.5% (annualized). 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, continuing improvement in interest on loans ($2.235 million in 2016, $1.099 million in 2015, and $872,000 in 2014) is reflective of the growth in the portfolio of performing loans and the increasing effective yield rate (9.8% in 2016, 7.1% and 2015, and 5.4% in 2014).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective yield rate on the loan portfolio was higher than the portfolio interest rate (8.9% and 8.3%, respectively) due to default-rate interest received on two loans collected in September 2016.  
 REO income decreased approximately $1.876 million (74.6%) for the three months ended, and $3.891 million (58.7%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, due primarily to the sale of certain REO properties and the overall reduction in the REO portfolio. As the REO portfolio continues to sell in a favorable real estate market, and the proceeds are reinvested in performing loans, REO income is expected to decline with offsetting increases to interest income. REO income includes earnings from rental operations, net of mortgage interest, holding costs of non-rental properties, impairment gains or losses on all REO and gains or losses on the sale of REO.   
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.308 million, a decrease of $1.684 million (28.1%) compared to the same period in 2015 due to the decrease in REO income as the REO portfolio is liquidated, and proceeds reinvested in loans. Total operations expense as a percent of interest income on loans was 53.6% and 104.6% for the three months ended, and 71.7% and 92.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Limited Partners  Capital   End-of-Period 
 The September 30, 2016 end-of-period limited partners  capital balance was approximately $173.4 million, which was a decrease of approximately 8.3% ($15.8 million) over 2015 s $189.2 million.  The decrease in limited partners  capital is due to liquidations and distributions made, partially offset by net income allocated to the limited partners. 

30 

Secured Loans   End-of-Period  
 The September 30, 2016 end-of-period secured loan balance of approximately $83.4 million, was an increase of approximately 78.5% ($36.7 million) over the September 30, 2015 end-of-period secured loan balance of approximately $46.7 million.  The Secured loans   average daily balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately $8.188 million or approximately 11.5% compared to the average daily balance for the same period in 2015.  The increases in the loan portfolio are due primarily to the sale of REO, with proceeds reinvested in loans.  
 The partnership added approximately $15.0 million and $61.7 million of new loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (respectively). 
 As of September 30, 2016, 45 (79%) of the partnership s loans (representing 96% of the aggregate principal of the partnership s loan portfolio) have a term of five years or less from loan inception.  The remaining loans have terms longer than five years.  Substantially all loans are written without a prepayment-penalty clause. As of September 30, 2016, 22 (39%) of the loans outstanding (representing 62% of the aggregate principal balance of the partnership s loan portfolio) provide for monthly payments of interest only, with the principal due in full at maturity.  The remaining loans require monthly payments of principal and interest, typically calculated on a 30-year amortization, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity. 
 We have sought to exercise strong discipline in underwriting loan applications and lending against collateral at amounts that create a mortgage portfolio that has substantial protective equity (i.e., safety margins to outstanding debt) as indicated by the overall conservative weighted average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) which at September 30, 2016 was 51.7%.  Thus, per the appraisal-based valuations at the time of loan inception, borrowers have, in the aggregate, equity of 48.3% in the property, and we as lender have lent in the aggregate 51.7% (including other senior liens on the property) against the properties we hold as collateral for the repayment of our loans. 
 See Note 4 (Loans) to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for detailed presentations on the secured loan portfolio and on the allowance for loan losses, which presentations are incorporated by this reference into this Item 2. 
 REO   End-of-Period 
 At September 30, 2016, the partnership held 10 REO properties (7 rental properties), all of which were designated held for sale. The September 30, 2016 end-of-period REO balance was approximately $76.2 million, which was a decrease of approximately 25.7% ($26.3 million) compared to the September 30, 2015 balance of approximately $102.5 million, due to REO sales made in a favorable real estate market. 
 At September 30, 2016 approximately 88.5% ($67.4 million) of total REO was comprised of two properties located in Glendale, California. 
 The total REO balance and number of properties held is expected to continue to decline as the remaining properties are managed for income, marketed and sold, with the proceeds reinvested into new loans. 
 See Note 5 (REO) to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for detailed presentations of REO sales transactions, rental activity, and additional information regarding REO activity during the period. 
 Mortgages Payable   End-of-Period 
 The September 30, 2016 end-of-period mortgages payable balance was approximately $27.1 million, which was a decrease of approximately 2.0% (565,000) compared to the September 30, 2015 balance of $27.7 million. The decrease is due to the partnership making regular mortgage payments consisting of principal and interest, and the payoff of loans due to the sale of REO held as collateral.

Interest on loans  
 Interest on loans increased approximately $1.136 million (103.4%) for the three months ended and $1.340 million (33.7%) for nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively, due to the continued increase in the balance of performing loans and the increase in the effective interest rates. 
 Provision for (recovery of) loan losses/allowance for loan losses 
 At September 30, 2016, the partnership had no allowance for loan losses as all loans had protective equity such that at September 30, 2016, collection was deemed probable for amounts owing.  
 REO - rental operations, net after mortgage interest 
 At September 30, 2016, the partnership held 7 rental properties, all of which were designated held for sale, and not subject to depreciation.  
 Rental operations, net after mortgage interest decreased by approximately $249,000 for the three months ended, and $1.116 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively, primarily due to the sale of REO properties. 
 Rental financial highlights by property type are presented in the table below for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 ($ in thousands).

Revenues   REO   Impairment (loss)/gain  
 There was no impairment (loss)/gain for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. The REO impairment (loss)/gain is primarily driven by specific reserves, associated with the estimated net realizable value of properties, as analyzed each year. 
 Operations Expense

Significant changes to operations expense areas for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 are summarized in the following table ($ in thousands). 

Mortgage servicing fees 
 The increase in mortgage servicing fees was due to the increase in the average secured loan balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   Asset management fees 
 The decrease in asset management fees was due to the reduction in the total capital under management for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   Costs from RMC 
 The decrease in costs from RMC for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due primarily to a reduction in total capital under management.  
 34 

Professional ser  vices  
 Professional services, including audit and  tax fees, increased due primarily to changes in the provision of services rendered for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The ongoing sources of funds for loans are the proceeds from (1) earnings retained (i.e. not distributed) in partners  capital accounts, (2) loan payoffs, (3) borrowers  monthly principal and interest payments, (4) REO sales, and, (5) to a lesser degree and, if obtained, a line of credit.  Cash generated from loan payoffs and borrower payments of principal and interest is used for operating expenses, income distributions to partners, and partner liquidations. The cash flow in excess of these uses is to be re-invested in new loans. 
 Cash flows by operating function are summarized in the following table ($ in thousands). 

The presentation above differs in format from the Statements of Cash Flows included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and emphasizes net cash generated or used in the partnership s primary business activity.  The format of the Statements of Cash Flows is defined by GAAP. 
   
 35 

Contractual Obligations  
 The partnership s contractual obligations consist of one mortgage note payable of approximately $27.1 million which matures in 2022. See Note 5 (Real Estate Owned (REO)) to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a detailed presentation on mortgage notes payable, which presentation is incorporated by this reference into this Item 2. 
 At September 30, 2016, the partnership had no construction or rehabilitation loans outstanding. 
 Distributions to limited partners 
 At the time of their subscription to the partnership, limited partners elected either to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions from the partnership, or to compound profits in their capital account. If an investor initially elected to receive monthly, quarterly or annual distributions, such election, once made, is irrevocable. If the investor initially elected to compound profits in their capital account, in lieu of cash distributions, the investor may, after three (3) years, change the election and receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions. Profits allocable to limited partners who elect to compound profits in their capital account will be retained by the partnership for making further loans or for other proper partnership purposes and such amounts will be added to such limited partners  capital accounts. The percentage of limited partners electing distribution of allocated net income, by weighted average to total partners  capital was 58.1% and 59.1% at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based upon that evaluation, the general partners concluded the partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the manager s or partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

None of these actions would typically be of any material importance. As of September 30, 2016, the partnership was not involved in any legal proceedings other than those that would be considered part of the normal course of business.
