LUMINAR MEDIA GROUP, INC.    
  (formerly Golden Edge Entertainment Inc.)  
  Notes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements  
  September 30, 2016  
 (Unaudited) 
   
  1.     
  Organization and Nature of Business  
   
 Luminar Media Group, Inc. ( the Company  or  the Issuer ) was organized under the name Retail Spicy Gourmet, Inc. under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010. The name was changed to Golden Edge Entertainment, Inc. on February 26, 2013, and to Luminar Media Group, Inc. on August 26, 2016. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ( SGO ). Under SGO s Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company was incorporated to: (1) receive and hold any interest which SGO had in the business of retail sales of imported spices; and (2) issue shares of its common stock to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholder. The Company incorporated its 100% owned subsidiary, Big Data Media, LLC., under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 1, 2016.  
   
 On February 1, 2013, the Company resolved to enter the music production and distribution business. The Company is a development stage business that intends to develop revenue by providing professional services to recording artists. Such services include production of recordings, management of the manufacture of CDs and internet uploading of music files, and management of the manufacture of promotional merchandise such as T-shirts and caps. The Company has been in the development stage since its formation and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.       
   
 The Company has developed its business plan and has commenced marketing of its services but has realized no revenues to date. The Company's business plan calls for the Company to provide on-line services through the Company's new platform, Big Data Media ( BDM ).   The primary focus of BDM is to charge customers to create and host content in the eLearning sector where courses and modules can then be continually improved, fine-tuned and evolve into an efficient, effective and engaging e-learning. 
  2.   
  Presentation of Financial Statements  
     
  Basis of Presentation  
     
 These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the Company s most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required in annual financial statements, but rather are prepared in accordance with recommendations for interim financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies, and methods as those used by the Company in the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, except when disclosed below. 
   
 The unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as at September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Note disclosures have been presented for material updates to the information previously reported in the annual financial statements. 
   
  Estimates  
   
 The preparation of these condensed interim financial statements has required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
   
 On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to accrued liabilities and contingencies, the valuation of income taxes, stock based compensation, warrants and convertible notes payable. The Company bases its estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  

Actual results could differ from those estimates. As adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. 
   
  3. Going Concern  
   
 The Company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. In accordance with ASU 2014-15, management has evaluated the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has determined that there is substantial doubt that the Company will continue as a going concern due to the Company's accumulated deficit of $266,590 as of September 30, 2016 ($167,173 - December 31, 2015), and working capital deficiency of $144,286 (December 31, 2015 - $59,677). The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing, as may be required. The accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The Company is in the development stage and has not yet realized profitable operations and has relied on non-operational sources to fund operations. The Company has suffered recurring losses and additional future losses are anticipated as the Company has not yet been able to generate revenue. The condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The officers and directors have committed to provide advances to fund certain operating costs of the Company. 
   
  4. Convertible Notes Payable  
   
 The Company received on July 27, 2015, a total of $10,000 by issuance of a convertible note. This convertible promissory note bears interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum. This note was payable one year from the date of issuance. It is convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.40 per share. The expiry date of the convertible note was extended to July 31, 2017. 
   
 On September 9, 2015, the Company issued a convertible line of credit to an investor that provides for a maximum borrowing of $50,000, which was increased to $100,000 in August 2016.  In addition, the maturity date of the line of credit was extended by one year to September 9, 2017. As at September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $68,250 under this convertible line of credit. The convertible line of credit (i) is unsecured, (ii) bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum, and (iii) is due on September 9, 2017.  The outstanding balance under this convertible line of credit is convertible at any time at the option of the investor into shares of the Company s common stock that is determined by dividing the amount to be converted by 60% of the bid price on the day of conversion.   
   
 Due to the variable conversion price associated with this convertible line of credit, the Company has determined that the conversion feature is considered a derivative liability.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a change in fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $59,953 (2015   ($1,993)) and $71,585 (2015   ($1,993)) or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   
   
 The Company recognized financing costs of $23,465 and $30,998 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and amortization of debt discount of $43,031 and $70,968 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 On January 8, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note for $20,00. The convertible promissory note bears interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum, and is payable one year from the date of issuance. It is convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.20 per share. Commencing on the demand date, all principal and accrued interest shall be payable by the Company upon demand by the investor. 

5. Derivative Liability  
     The convertible line of credit discussed in Note 4 has a variable conversion price which results in the conversion feature being recorded as a derivative liability.  
   
 The fair value of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded in the statement of operations under other income (expense). 
   
   The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions to measure the fair value of derivative liability at September 30, 2016. 

The following table represents the Company s derivative liability activity for the period ended September 30, 2016:   

6. Stockholders' equity common stock

 The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded operating expenses of $69,036 compared to $46,690 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher professional fees and salaries in the 2016 period. 
   
  GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. In accordance with ASU 2014-15, management has evaluated the company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has determined that there is substantial doubt that the company will continue as a going concern due to the Company's accumulated deficit of $266,590 as of September 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015 $167,173). The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing, as may be required. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 Our management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the last day of the fiscal period covered by this report, September 30, 2016. The term disclosure controls and procedures means our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not    effective at a reasonable assurance level. A control system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
