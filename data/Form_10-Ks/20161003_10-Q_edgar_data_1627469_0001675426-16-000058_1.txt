    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   august
31, 2016   

   (unaudited)   

Note
1 -Organization and Description of Business      

Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. (the Company)
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect
an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. As of
August 31, 2016 the Company had not yet commenced any operations. 

The Company has elected November 30th
as its year end. 

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These unaudited
condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements provided in the
Form S-1 filed April 12, 2016 for the year ended November 30, 2015 and notes thereto. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of unaudited condensed
interim financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Due to the minimal level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions
or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern. 

Cash Flows Reporting  

The Company follows ASC 230,  Statement of Cash Flows ,
for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing
activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ( Indirect method )
as defined by ASC 230 to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow
from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals
of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating
cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current
exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported
as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides
information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.  

-F4- 

Table of Contents  

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes
under ASC 740,   Income Taxes .   Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely
than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were
recognized at August 31, 2016 or November 30, 2015. 

Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share
amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue
common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of
the Company. 

The Company does not have any potentially dilutive instruments
as of August 31, 2016 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable. 

Related Parties  

 The Company follows ASC 850,  Related Party
Disclosures,  for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. 

Note
3 - Going Concern   

 The Company s financial statements are prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these unaudited condensed
interim financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital
deficiency, negative cash flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios. 

The Company has not established any source of revenue to
cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is no
assurance that management's plan will be successful. 

The unaudited condensed interim financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Note
4 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under
authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the  FASB Accounting Standards Codification   ( ASC )
is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. 

We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported
and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting
principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s reported
financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial
management and certain standards are under consideration. 

In June 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2015-10,  Technical Corrections and Updates.  The amendments in this update cover a wide range of topics in
the codification and are generally categorized as follows: Amendments Related to Differences between Original Guidance and the
Codification; Guidance Clarification and Reference Corrections; Simplification; and, Minor Improvements. The amendments are effective
for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
but not required; at this time we are not early adopting. As the objectives of this standard are to clarify the codification; correct
unintended application of guidance; eliminate inconsistencies; and, to improve the codification s presentation of guidance,
the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations. 

In January 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) No. 2015-01,  Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20).  This update eliminates
from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendment may be applied both prospectively and retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted, but not required; as long as the standard is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
At this time, we are not early adopting. As the objective of this standard is to reduce cost and complexity and alleviate uncertainty
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of information provided to the users of financial statements, the adoption of this
standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations. 

In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern; Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The amendments in this update provide guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The
guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early adoption is permitted but not required; at this time we are not early adopting. As the objective of this accounting standard
is to provide guidance on the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, the adoption
of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10,
Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable
Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting
requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities and also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities
in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment
equity that is at risk. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim
periods therein, with early application permitted. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting
period or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities)
or made available for issuance (other entities). We early adopted this pronouncement. As the objective of the amendments in this
update is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements
for development stage entities our early adoption of this guidance has not impacted our financial position or results of operations. 

Note

and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain statements, other than purely historical information,
including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the
assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believes,   project, 
 expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   strategy,   plan, 
 may,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely
result,  and similar expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement
for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could
have a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to:
changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally
accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

Company Overview  

Corporate History  

Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. (the Company)
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect
an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. 

Thomas DeNunzio was appointed CEO, CFO,
President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director       of the Company on September 29, 2014. 

On September 29, 2014, Thomas
DeNunzio, our officer and director, paid for expenses involved with the incorporation of Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. with personal
funds on behalf of Exquisite Acquisition, Inc., in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of common stock each, par value $0.0001 per share,
which issuance was exempt from the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act under Section 4(2) of such same said
act. The value of the stock provided to Mr. DeNunzio, based on the par value of $.0001 per share of common stock, is valued at
$800. 

The price of the common stock issued
to Thomas DeNunzio was arbitrarily determined and bore no relationship to any objective criterion of value. At the time of issuance,
the Company was recently formed or in the process of being formed and possessed no assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Our cash balance is $0 as of August 31, 2016. Our cash balance
is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds
from Thomas DeNunzio, our sole Officer and Director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for filing fees,
and professional fees. Thomas DeNunzio, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan
funds to the company.  

We have no assets as of August 31, 2016. 

Net Loss   

We recorded a net loss of $5,300  for the three months
ended August 31, 2016, $1,750 for the three months ended August 31, 2015, $7,825 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016,
and $5,300 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. 

The variance in net loss for the aforementioned
periods is due to changes  in the going rate of particular professional fees. 

We are currently a blank check shell company. 

Going Concern   

The Company s financial statements are prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these unaudited condensed
interim financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital
deficiency, negative cash flow from operating activities, and other adverse key financial ratios. 

The Company has not established any source of revenue to
cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital. There is no
assurance that management's plan will be successful. 

ITEM 3

ITEM 4   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Management s Report on Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, Thomas DeNunzio, (who is acting as our principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

As of August 31, 2016, the end of the fiscal period
covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our sole officer and director, of the
effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our sole officer and director
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report
due to material weaknesses identified below. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness
of controls    

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations
which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or
changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible
to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that have occurred during our fiscal year end November 30, 2015 and for the interim period ending August 31, 2016, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 2   
         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

On September 29, 2014, Thomas
DeNunzio, our officer and director, paid for expenses involved with the incorporation of Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. with personal
funds on behalf of Exquisite Acquisition, Inc., in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of common stock each, par value $0.0001 per share,
which issuance was exempt from the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act under Section 4(2) of such same said
act. The value of the stock provided to Mr. DeNunzio, based on the par value of $.0001 per share of common stock, is valued at
$800. 

The price of the common stock issued
to Thomas DeNunzio was arbitrarily determined and bore no relationship to any objective criterion of value. At the time of issuance,
