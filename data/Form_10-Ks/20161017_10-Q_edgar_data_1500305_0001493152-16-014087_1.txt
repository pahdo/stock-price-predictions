1.      Organization
                                         and Nature of Operations     

Blue
Spa Incorporated ( the Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on September 4, 2009. The Company is
in its early developmental stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company
was engaged in the development of an internet based retailer of a multi-channel concept combining a wholesale distribution with
a retail strategy relating to the quality personal care products, fitness apparel and related accessories. The Company obtained
a majority vote from its shareholders to amend the Company s name from  Blue Spa Incorporated  to  Sustainable
Petroleum Group Inc.  to better reflect the new direction it plans to undertake in the oil and gas business. The name change
will be effected on or around October 20, 2016 or as soon as practicable, pending regulatory approval.  

The
Company has chosen a fiscal year end May 31.  

2.      Going
                                         Concern     

These
interim financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited operations and has sustained
operating losses resulting in a deficit. In view of these matters, realization of a major portion of the assets in the accompanying
balance sheet is dependent upon the continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company s ability
to meet its financing requirements, and the success of its future operations.  

The
Company has accumulated a deficit of $248,829 since inception September 4, 2009, has yet to achieve profitable operations and
further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern
is in substantial doubt and is dependent upon obtaining additional financing and/or achieving a sustainable profitable level of
operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The
Company believes that the cash on hand will be able to meet its on-going costs in the next 12 months. The Company may seek additional
equity as necessary and it expects to raise funds through private or public equity investment in order to support existing operations
and expand the range of its business. There is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the Company on acceptable
terms, if at all.  

3.      Interim
                                         reporting and significant accounting policies     

While
the information presented is unaudited, it includes all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present
fairly the financial position, result of operation and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested
that the interim condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s May 31, 2016 annual financial
statements. Operating results for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
can be expected for the year ended May 31, 2017.  

There
have been no changes in the accounting policies from those disclosed in the notes to the audited financial statements for the
year ended May 31, 2016.  

4.      Recently
                                         issued accounting pronouncements      

The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently
issued would, if adopted, have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements  

5.      Accrued
                                         expenses     

Accrued
expenses as of August 31, 2016 are summarized as follows:  

6.      Common
                                         stock     

During
the period ended August 31, 2016, no shares of common stock were sold. There were a total of 7,000,000 common stocks issued and
outstanding as of August 31, 2016. There were no warrants or stock options outstanding as of August 31, 2016.     

7.      Notes
                                         payable, due to Shareholders     

There
are seven (7) unsecured promissory notes bearing interest at 8% per annum which are due on demand.  

There
are two (2) unsecure promissory notes bearing interest at 4% per annum which are due on demand.  

There
are six (6) unsecured promissory notes bearing interest at 8% per annum which are due on demand, and convertible at a conversion
price of US$0.005 per share at the lender s option. The convertible notes are at the same interest rate as promissory notes
that have no conversion feature.  

8.      Subsequent
                                         Events     

On
                                         September 15, 2016, the Company entered into a notes payable with a shareholder of the
                                         Company in the amount of $20,000. The note bears an interest rate of 4% per annum and
                                         is due on demand.    

Subsequent
                                         to August 31, 2016, the Company obtained a majority vote from its shareholders to amend
                                         the Company s name from  Blue Spa Incorporated  to  Sustainable
                                         Petroleum Group Inc.  The name change will be effected on or around October 20,
                                         2016 or as soon as practicable, pending regulatory approval.    

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.   

General   

The
following discussion of Blue Spa s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations for the
three months ended August 31, 2016 should be read in conjunction with Blue Spa s unaudited interim financial statements
and related notes for the three months ended August 31, 2016.  

Blue
Spa is a startup company that intends to expand its online business and to focus on, identify, and assess new oil and gas projects
for acquisition that are global in nature. Blue Spa is currently a  shell  company as defined by the SEC as a result
of only having nominal operations and nominal assets. It is management s intent to develop its existing assets or acquire
new assets that will generate revenues for Blue Spa and so that Blue Spa will no longer be deemed a  shell  company.
Management will continue to focus on the development, production, wholesale distribution, and retail sales of quality natural
skin and body care products, fitness apparel, and related accessories, and will also focus on new oil and gas projects on an international
level. In anticipation of expanding its business, management has decided that Blue Spa should begin the timely process of changing
its name. Management believes that a name change will result in Blue Spa having a name that more accurately reflects the expanded
focus of its business.   

Blue
Spa has not commenced significant operations nor generated any revenues and is considered a Development Stage Company, as defined
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No.7  Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises ,
and follows the guideline of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codifications
( ASC ) Topic 915 Development State Entities  

Forward
Looking Statements   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties, including statements regarding Blue Spa s capital needs, business plans and expectations. Such forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding Blue Spa s ability to carry out its planned development and production
of products. Forward-looking statements are made, without limitation, in relation to Blue Spa s operating plans, Blue Spa s
liquidity and financial condition, availability of funds, operating and exploration costs and the market in which Blue Spa competes.
Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  will ,  should ,
 expect ,  plan ,  intend ,  anticipate ,  believe ,  estimate ,
 predict ,  potential  or  continue , the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.
Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including
the risks outlined below, and, from time to time, in other reports Blue Spa files with the SEC. These factors may cause Blue Spa s
actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Blue Spa disclaims any obligation to publicly update these
statements, or disclose any difference between its actual results and those reflected in these statements. The information constitutes
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Given these uncertainties,
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  

Plan
of Operation  

Blue
Spa s plan of operation for the next 12 months is to:  

1.
Strengthen its management and board of directors.  

2.
Identify, and assess new oil and gas projects for acquisition.  

3.
Develop and launch its website.  

In
addition, management anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next 12 month period:   

Management
    anticipates spending approximately $1,000 in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month for the next 12 months,
    for a total anticipated expenditure of $12,000 over the next 12 months. The general and administrative expenses for the year
    will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to Blue Spa s regulatory filings throughout
    the year, as well as transfer agent fees, development costs and general office expenses.   

Management
    anticipates spending approximately $16,000 in complying with Blue Spa s obligations as a reporting company under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These expenses will consist primarily of professional fees relating to the preparation of
    Blue Spa s financial statements and completing and filing its annual report, quarterly report, and current report filings
    with the SEC.   

As
at August 31, 2016, Blue Spa had cash of $21,933 and total liabilities of $253,762. Accordingly, Blue Spa will require additional
financing in the amount of $259,829 in order to fund its obligations as a reporting company under the  Securities Act of 1934
 and its general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months.  

During
the 12 month period following the date of this report, management anticipates that Blue Spa will not generate any revenue. Accordingly,
Blue Spa will be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue its plan of operations. Management believes that
debt financing will not be an alternative for funding Blue Spa s plan of operations as it does not have tangible assets
to secure any debt financing. Rather management anticipates that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from
the sale of Blue Spa s common stock. However, Blue Spa does not have any financing arranged and cannot provide investors
with any assurance that it will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common stock to fund its plan of operations.
In the absence of such financing, Blue Spa will not be able to develop its products and its business plan will fail. Even if Blue
Spa is successful in obtaining equity financing and developing its products, additional development of its website and marketing
program will be required. If Blue Spa does not continue to obtain additional financing, it will be forced to abandon its business
and plan of operations.  

Risk
Factors   

An
investment in Blue Spa s common stock involves a number of very significant risks. Prospective investors should refer to
all the risk factors disclosed in Blue Spa s Form S-1/A   Amendment #3 filed on December 15, 2011.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Three
Month Period Ended August 31, 2016   

At
August 31, 2015, Blue Spa had a cash balance of $21,933388 and a working capital deficiency of $231,829 for the three month period
ended August 31, 2016, compared to a cash balance of $nil and negative cash flows from operating activities of $212,097 for the
fiscal period ended May 31, 2016.  

The
notes to Blue Spa s unaudited interim financial statements as of August 31, 2016, disclose its uncertain ability to continue
as a going concern. Blue Spa has not and does not expect to generate any revenues to cover its expenses while it is in the development
stage and as a result Blue Spa has accumulated a deficit of $248,829 since inception. As of August 31, 2016, Blue Spa had $253,762
in current liabilities compared to $212,097 for the time period ended May 31, 2016. When its current liabilities are offset against
its current assets of $21,933 Blue Spa is left with a negative working capital of $231,829.  

While
Blue Spa has successfully generated sufficient working capital through the sale of common stock and management believes that Blue
Spa can continue to do so for the next year, there are no assurances that Blue Spa will succeed in generating sufficient working
capital through the sale of common stock to meet its ongoing cash needs.  

Net
Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities .  Net cash flows from operating activities during the three month period ended
August 31, 2016 was a net loss of $4,067, which was primarily due to a increase in accrued expenses of $12,416 and an increase
in interest payable of $3,249, compared to a net loss of $3,534 for the same time period for the prior fiscal period, which was
primarily due to a net loss of $5,511, a decrease in accrued expenses of $725 and an increase in interest payable of $2,702.  

Net
Cash Flows From Investing Activities .  Blue Spa did not have any net cash flow from investing activities during the three
month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to $nil for the same time period for the prior fiscal period.   

Net
Cash Flows From Financing Activities  . Blue Spa s net cash flow from financing activities during the three month
period ended August 31, 2016 was $26,000 due to notes payable, compared to $nil for the same time period for the prior fiscal
period.

of Operations   Three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015   

References

fiscal 2015 are to Blue Spa s fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.  

Three
Month Period Ended August 31, 2016    

Net
Loss .  During the three month period ended August 31, 2016, Blue Spa had a net loss of $19,732 or $(0.003) per share. The
loss was primarily due to administrative and other operating expenses and interest expenses, compared to the same time period
for the prior fiscal period, when Blue Spa had a net loss of $5,511 or $ (0.001) per share, which was primarily due to administrative
and other operating expenses and interest expenses.

activities have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions and debt financing.  

Operating
Expenses .  Blue Spa s operating expenses during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 were $19,732. The operating
expenses were due to $16,483 in administrative and other operating expenses and $3,249 in interest expenses.  

Going
Concern   

Blue
Spa has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive business activities.
For these reasons the financial statements have been prepared assuming Blue Spa will continue as a going concern.  

Future
Financings   

Management
anticipates continuing to rely on equity sales of Blue Spa s common stock in order to continue to fund its business operations.
Issuances of additional common stock will result in dilution to Blue Spa s existing stockholders. There is no assurance
that Blue Spa will achieve any additional sales of its common stock or arrange for debt or other financing to fund its planned
activities.  

Inflation   

Management
does not believe that inflation will have a material impact on Blue Spa s future operations.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements   

Blue
Spa has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  

Contingencies
and Commitments

required under this item.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Blue
Spa s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. Management believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of Blue Spa s financial statements is critical to an understanding of Blue Spa s financial
statements.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management
makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when
the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate,
which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Development
Stage Company   

Blue
Spa is a developmental stage company, and follows the guideline of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Codifications ( ASC ) Topic 915 Development State Entities. All losses accumulated since inception
has been considered as part of Blue Spa s development stage activities.

Development Costs   

Blue
Spa recognized the costs associated with developing a website in accordance with ASC 350-50  Website Development Cost 
that codified the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ) Statement of Position ( SOP )
NO. 98-1,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use . Relating to website
development costs Blue Spa follows the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) NO. 00-2,  Accounting
for Website Development Costs . The website development costs are divided into three stages, planning, development and production.
The development stage can further be classified as application and infrastructure development, graphics development and content
development. In short, website development cost for internal use should be capitalized except content input and data conversion
costs in content development stage.  

Costs
associated with the website consist primarily of website development costs paid to third party. These capitalized costs will be
amortized based on their estimated useful life over three years upon the website becoming operational. Internal costs related
to the development of website content will be charged to operations as incurred. Web-site development costs related to the customers
are charged to cost of sales.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets
and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair values. The
fair value of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term
note - related party, approximate their carrying values since they are short term in nature and they are receivable or payable
on demand. Management is of the opinion that Blue Spa is exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from the bank-held
assets. Blue Spa is operating outside the United States of America and may have significant exposure to foreign currency risk
due to the fluctuation of the currency in which Blue Spa operates and the U.S. dollar. Blue Spa accounts for certain assets and
liabilities at fair value.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Blue
Spa places its cash and cash equivalents with a high credit quality financial institution. Blue Spa maintains United States Dollars.
Blue Spa minimizes its credit risks associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial
institution.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

Blue
Spa is located and operating outside of the United States of America. The functional currency of Blue Spa is the U.S. Dollar.
At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue and expense is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of the exchange
rate in effect at that date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured by using the exchange rate in
effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in operations.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs will be expensed as incurred.

required under this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Management
maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the   Exchange Act  ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
Blue Spa s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
Blue Spa s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

In
connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Blue Spa s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of August 31, 2016.  

Based
on that evaluation, management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that Blue Spa s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. In particular, Blue Spa failed
to complete and file its assessment of its internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner for the period ended
August 31, 2016. As a result, Blue Spa s disclosure controls and procedures have not been effective since then and, as a
result, were not effective for the period covered by this report.  

Subsequently,
management has adopted policy to utilize external service providers to review and provide comment on disclosure reports and statements.
As a result of the implementation of this policy, management believes that Blue Spa s disclosure controls and procedures
will now be effective.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, there were no changes in Blue Spa s internal controls over financial reporting
during the quarter ended August 31, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Blue Spa s
internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of management s last evaluation. However, as a result of
management s completion of the assessment of Blue Spa s internal controls over financial reporting, certain changes
have been made, as discussed above, that will materially affect Pioneer s internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that Blue Spa s controls and procedures
will prevent all potential error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
