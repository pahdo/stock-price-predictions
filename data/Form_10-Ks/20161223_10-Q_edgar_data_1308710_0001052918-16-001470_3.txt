NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   
   
   JayHawk Energy, Inc. (the  Company  or  JayHawk ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Jayhawk Gas Transportation Company, are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and sale of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids primarily from conventional reservoirs within North America.  The Company incorporated in Colorado on April 5, 2004 as Bella Trading Company, Inc.  During the third quarter ending June 30, 2007, the Company changed management and entered the oil and gas business, and ceased all activity in retail jewelry.  On June 21, 2007, the Company changed its name to JayHawk Energy, Inc.  Since then, the Company has devoted its efforts principally to the raising of capital, organizational infrastructure development, the acquisition of oil and gas properties and exploration activities in Kansas and North Dakota.  The Company also formed a wholly owned subsidiary to transport natural gas in Kansas called JayHawk Gas Transportation Corporation. 
   
 On September 1, 2015 the Company disposed of all of its interests, tangible or intangible, in and to the assets held or owned by the Company in the State of North Dakota. The disposition of the Company s North Dakota assets was completed through an asset assignment to a related party.    
   
 On October 8, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Domestication and corresponding Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada. Effective October 8, 2015, the Company s state of organization was moved from Colorado to Nevada. On October 22, 2015, the Company, in conjunction with its domestication to the State of Nevada, filed Articles of Dissolution in the State of Colorado.  
   
 The Company's strategy is to increase shareholder value through strategic acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, primarily in North America.  
   
 As of September 30, 2015, JayHawk Energy remains an early stage oil and gas exploration company. The Company's immediate business plan is to focus its efforts on identifying oil and gas assets for future acquisition and development.  The Company is actively focused on shifting to a liquids-rich development focus, primarily in established oil and gas producing regions of North America. The Company's main priority will be given to projects with near term cash flow potential and proven, producing oil and gas reserves. Future acquisition and development activities will be determined by the Company's ability to access sources of sufficient funding. 
    NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, as well as the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending September 30, 2016. 
   
   For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015.     
   
    Principles of Consolidation  
   
   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary JayHawk Gas Transportation Company after elimination of the intercompany accounts and transactions. 

6 

Going Concern  
   
 As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows.  As shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of   $28,469,669 and a net loss of $730,504 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016, and as of that date the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $2,281,999.  Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing, to locate profitable energy properties and generate revenue from current and planned business operations, and control costs.  The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing, obtaining additional financing from investors, and/or lenders, and attaining additional commercial production.  However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives, therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists.  The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the settlement of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods.  Significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to asset impairments, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, income taxes and derivatives.  Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations. 
   
  Income or Loss Per Common Share    
   
 Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities.  
   
 The potential dilutive effect of convertible and outstanding securities as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 would be as follows: 

At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the Company's outstanding options and common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.    
   
  Revenue and Cost Recognition  
   
 The Company uses the sales method of accounting for oil and gas revenues. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volumes of gas and oil sold to purchasers. The volume sold may differ from the volumes the Company may be entitled to, based on the Company's individual interest in the property.  Periodically, imbalances between production and nomination volumes can occur for various reasons.  In cases where imbalances have occurred, a production imbalance receivable or liability will be recorded when determined.  Costs associated with production are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
   
  Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. 

7 

Reclassifications  
   
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements in order to conform to the 2016 presentation.  These reclassifications have no effect on net loss, total assets or accumulated deficit as previously reported.   See Note 18 regarding revision of financial statements. 
   
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern. The guidance requires an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). If conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, the guidance requires disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance will be effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The Company plans to adopt this standard effective October 1, 2017 and anticipates the adoption will have minimal impact on the financial statements because the Company currently discloses the information required.  
   
  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS         
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, reclamation bonds, and promissory notes payable approximate fair value due to their limited time to maturity or ability to immediately convert them to cash in the normal course.   The approximate fair value of the convertible debentures and convertible line of credit based upon the number of shares into which the debentures are convertible is $1,585,189 using the current market price per share of stock at June 30, 2016.   
   
 The table below sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively, and the fair value calculation input hierarchy that the Company has determined has applied to each asset and liability category. 

NOTE 4   UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND IMPAIRMENT       
 The total of the Company's investment in unproved properties and equipment at June 30, 2016 and 2015, consists of the following capitalized costs respectively: 

8 

The Company s Kansas properties are currently not producing.  Management intends to evaluate the prospects of returning to production during the subsequent fiscal year and determine the economic viability of the project thereafter.  For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016, the Company performed an analysis to determine whether the carrying amounts in its financial statements exceeded the present value of the expected revenues directly associated with the Girard, Kansas property.  Management determined that the net value reflected in the financial statements did not exceed the present value of such revenues.  
   
  NOTE 5   PROVED PROPERTIES AND IMPAIRMENT         
   
 During the year ended September 30, 2015, management scrapped certain capitalized drilling costs and equipment associated with the Jenks and Knudsen wells in Crosby, North Dakota.  The Company determined the costs associated with completing the necessary engineering, road improvements and purchase of additional equipment to construct a disposal well exceeded the future benefits of said well.  The Company has plugged both the Jenks and Knudsen well bores. The loss on write-off of $11,527 was charged to operations as  Loss on leases and equipment . 
   
 Effective September 1, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance (the  Assignment ) with Vast Holdings, LLC ( Vast Holdings ), a related party at September 30, 2015.  The Assignment sells and assigns to Vast Holdings, in consideration of ten dollars ($10.00), all of the Company s right, title, interest and estate, real or personal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, in and to the assets held or owned by the Company in the State of North Dakota, including but not limited to: oil, gas and/or mineral leases, fee mineral interests, leasehold estates, mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, reversionary interests, net profits interests, and other similar rights, estates and interests and other agreements, the oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the assets and all units, wells, equipment, contracts, and records. Vast Holdings did not assume various liabilities associated with the North Dakota assets, including, but not limited to, working and royalty interests payable and liabilities associated with reclamation of the North Dakota properties. 
   
  Vast Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast Exploration, LLC.  Vast Exploration is a controlling shareholder of the Company, the contract operator of the Company s oil and gas properties and an affiliate of Vast Petroleum Corp., an entity that entered into a joint development agreement for the Company s oil and gas operations in Kansas in May 2014. The Assignment was made in lieu of foreclosure of certain Company debt obligations and the Company determined ten dollars was appropriate monetary consideration.  
   
  NOTE 6   RECLAMATION BONDS   
 Reclamation bonds consists of various deposits and reclamation bonds.  Detail is disclosed in the following 
 table: 

NOTE 7   CONVERTIBLE LINE OF CREDIT RELATED PARTY  
   
 On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit loan agreement ( Loan ) with Vast Exploration, LLC (the  Lender  or  Vast Exploration ). The Loan permits the Company to borrow up to $100,000 with an interest rate equal to 1.5% per month of the unpaid principal balance on the loan. The Company is required to pay principal on demand or, if not sooner demanded, then on or before June 30, 2016.  The Company is required to pay interest on demand or, if not sooner demanded, then on the 1st day of each month, commencing August 1, 2015. After demand, interest on the outstanding balance of the Loan will accrue at a rate equal to 2% per month. Vast Exploration has the right, at any time after the date of the Loan, at its election, to convert all or part of the Loan into shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of the lesser of 1) $0.005 per share or 2) 50% of the average of the three lowest trades during the twenty-five previous trading days preceding a conversion. 
   
 On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Line of Credit Modification Agreement with Vast Exploration ( Modification Agreement ).  The Modification Agreement adjusts the maximum principal balance that may be borrowed from $100,000 to $150,000.  At its sole discretion, Vast Exploration may increase the maximum principal balance beyond $150,000. 

9 

On September 25, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Line of Credit Modification Agreement with Vast Exploration ( Second Modification Agreement ).  The Second Modification Agreement amends the conversion price in the Loan to a non-variable conversion price of $0.005 per share of common stock. Advances related to reclamation of North Dakota properties (Note 18) may be converted at a non-variable conversion price of $0.0025 per share of common stock.  
   
 On June 30, 2016, Vast Exploration, LLC gave notice to the Company that the $150,000 Revolving Line of Credit Note ( Line of Credit ) entered into between the parties on June 30, 2015 would not be renewed past the maturity date of the Line of Credit and that the final date for determining the principal and interested owed to Vast Exploration on the Line of Credit would be June 30, 2016. 
   
 As of June 30, 2016, the Loan balance was $380,014. The balance of accrued interest on the Loan at June 30, 2016 was $59,308 and is included in  accrued interest, related parties .  The balance of the Loan and accrued interest thereon was convertible to 175,728,792 shares of the Company s common stock based on the amended conversion price. 
    NOTE 8   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES   
 The Company s related party convertible debentures and accrued interest consist of the following: 

The Company s non-related party convertible debentures and accrued interest consist of the following: 

The debentures are collateralized by all Company assets located in the State of Kansas and all of the Company s rights in JayHawk Gas Transportation Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary.   
   
 As of June 30, 2016, there remains a total of $350,000 of unamortized discount on the issuance of the 2014 convertible debentures. 

10 

At June 30, 2016, principal payments on the convertible debentures are due as follows: 

NOTE 9   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   
   
  Conversion Options Derivative  
   
 The Company had convertible debentures which contained provisions allowing holders of the debentures to convert outstanding debt to shares of the Company's common stock (Note 8). The debentures contained anti-dilution provisions which call for the debt conversion and warrant exercise prices to be reduced based on future issues of debt or equity with more favorable provisions.  Management has determined that these provisions cause the conversion options and warrants to require derivative liability accounting.  As such, management valued them at fair value at the date of issuance.    During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a modification agreement with the holders of the convertible debentures.  The modification agreement changed the conversion price to $0.01 per common share and also specifically eliminated provisions of the debentures requiring conversion derivative accounting.  The fair value of the derivative liability on that date of $1,244,472 was charged to  additional paid-in capital . 
   
  Warrant Derivative  
   
 Stock purchase warrants were also issued with the convertible debentures (Note 8).   Provisions contained within these warrants require the warrants to be accounted for as derivatives.    At June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the fair value of warrant derivative liability was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: 

Below is detail of the change in warrant derivative liability balance for three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

11 

Below is detail of the change in warrant derivative liability balance for nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

NOTE 11.  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  
   
 The Company has identified asset retirement obligations at the Girard, Kansas and Crosby, North Dakota operating sites.  These retirement obligations are determined based on the estimated cost to comply with abandonment regulations established by the Kansas Corporation Commission and the State of North Dakota.  The Company's engineers have estimated the cost, to comply with these regulations.  These estimates have been projected out to the anticipated retirement date 6 to 15 years in the future, at an assumed inflation rate of 1.5 percent.  These amounts were discounted back at an assumed interest rate of 10 percent, to arrive at a net present value of the obligation.  
   
 During the year ended September 30, 2015, with respect to its Kansas properties, the Company revised its estimate to include additional well bores not previously considered to be subject to remediation exposure for the Company.  The increase in present value liability was added to the Company s Asset Retirement Obligation Asset which shall be amortized over the remaining useful life of the Kansas asset.   The Company revised its estimate on the remaining Kansas Asset Retirement Obligation to $112,311 as of September 30, 2015.  
   
 The amount of the increase in the obligation is charged to accretion expense and for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was computed to be $6,166 and $4,016, respectively.  The amount of the increase in the obligation is charged to accretion expense and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was computed to be $18,498 and $12,048, respectively.  The Company expended $37,780 of reclamation work related to asset retirement obligation in North Dakota during the nine months ended June 30, 2016. 

13

  NOTE 16   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
   
 On August 1, 2013, the North Dakota Industrial Commission ( NDIC ) submitted an administrative complaint to the State of North Dakota related to plugging and remediation of the Company s Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells in Crosby, ND. On February 18, 2014, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement with the State of North Dakota whereby the Company was required to finish reclamation work, by June 30, 2014, on the two waste water storage pits adjacent to the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells respectively.  The Consent Agreement required the Company to plug the  production zone  of the Jenks #1 well. Once plugging was completed, the Company could then apply for a permit to convert the Jenks #1 well into a salt water disposal well.  As a part of the Consent Agreement the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of no less than $105,000, consisting of $25,000 due and payable upon execution of the Consent Agreement and a $16,000 installment payment per month for five successive months thereafter.  If the Company failed to comply with the terms of the Consent Agreement, the Company would be subject to penalties of up to an additional $420,000 (over and above the $105,000 penalty agreed to in the Consent Agreement). The Company made the initial $25,000 payment and subsequently made each monthly payment with the final installment of $16,000 paid to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.  The Company made the final installment payment of $16,000 to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.  As of September 30, 2014, the Company had completed substantially all reclamation work and has paid all fines assessed. 
   
 On July 10, 2014, the Company completed reclamation work on both the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 waste water storage pits.  Although reclamation work was to have been completed by June 30, 2014, unseasonably heavy rains which saturated the soil and limited safe access to the site by heavy equipment delayed scheduled reclamation until such time as ground conditions improved. The Company also completed plugging of the  production zone  on the Jenks #1 well and set a balance plug on the Knudsen #1 well bore.  Due to JayHawk s failure to timely submit a cost estimate for the final plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1 well and site, the NDIC, on January 28, 2015, pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588 ordered JayHawk to file a $120,000 bond covering the Jenks #1. The bond was a plugging and reclamation bond.  On May 9, 2015, the Company received a copy of a Summons and Complaint filed by the State of North Dakota and the NDIC in the Northwest Judicial District Court of North Dakota alleging JayHawk had violated N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08 by failing to post the $120,000 plugging and reclamation bond pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588. N.D.C.C.   38-08-16 provides that anyone who violates a provision of N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08, or any rule or regulation of the Commission is subject to a penalty of up to $12,500 for each offense, and each day s violation is a separate offense. The Complaint s prayer for relief requested that JayHawk be ordered to deposit $120,000 with the Bank of North Dakota to  

17 

satisfy the Commission s requirement for the plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1 well. The NDIC also requested that JayHawk pay a fine of $12,500 per day beginning February 4, 2015, for failure to provide a plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1. The Company subsequently met with the NDIC, which resulted in the NDIC staying the litigation subject to JayHawk s immediate plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1. In September of 2015 the Company completed final plugging and abandonment of the Jenks #1 and completed a partial reclamation of the well and site.  
   
 On February 12, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Staff of the Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas with respect to a Penalty Order served by the Company for failure to comply with certain portions of the Kansas Administrative Regulations.  The Company was found in violation of failure to plug, return to service or temporarily abandon 71 wells and assessed a $7,100 penalty, of which $3,100 was payable immediately, a $2,000 payment due by April 1, 2015 and the final $2,000 payment by May 1, 2015.  The Company has subsequently submitted 71 temporary abandonment applications, of which 71 applications were approved.

 Audit fees and public company expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 by $7,913 over the comparable three months ended June 30 2015, as the Company deferred filing certain reports during the period for lack of financial resources.   
   
 Office and other general and administrative expenses decreased 88.5% or $1,152 to $150 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $1,302 for the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. 
   
  General and Administrative Expenses:   General and administrative expenses decreased 69.0% or $270,540 to $121,415 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 from $391,955 for the comparable period ended June 30 2015. 

Compensation and payroll taxes decreased $148,607 over the comparable nine-month period ending June 30, 2015.  Company management took no salary during the nine months ended June 30, 2016, and all compensation related expenses were non-cash accruals during the current fiscal period.

  Other Income (Expense):   Detail of the aggregate of this classification for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is disclosed in the following table:  

23 

Net interest and financing costs decreased $838,971 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30 2015.  Several one-time financing transactions related to recognition of default interest on debentures did not recur in the current fiscal period.   Net interest, related party expense increased $40,781 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 because a related party held debentures for the entire fiscal quarter in 2016.  Additionally, interest expense is reported net of interest income, of which there was a minimal amount reported in the current year because of limited excess cash availability for investment.   
   
 The Company had no conversion option derivative for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and, consequently, the associated gain decreased by $11,105 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.   
   
 Detail of the aggregate of this classification for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is disclosed in the following table:  

Total interest expense decreased $799,071 during the nine months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended June 30 2015.   
   
 During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, the former President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors forgave $84,500 of accrued compensation and four members of the Company s board of directors entered into agreements in which $206,250 of accrued directors  fees were forgiven in consideration of 600,000 shares of the Company s common stock with a fair value 
 of $6,000. The Company recognized  gain on forgiveness of liabilities  of $284,750 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. This one-time gain did not recur during the three months ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, Vast Exploration, LLC acquired from various investors certain Convertible Debentures of Jayhawk Energy, Inc.  Subsequent conversions of a portion of the debentures for shares of common stock of Jayhawk Energy, Inc., resulted in loss on extinguishment and conversion of debt of $1,179,688.  This expense did not recur during the nine months ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 Vast Exploration, LLC, a related party, assumed liabilities in consideration of warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, which resulted in a loss on settlement of liabilities of $274,349 during the nine months ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 The Company had no conversion option derivative for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and, consequently, the associated gain on change in fair value of the derivative liability decreased by $389,589 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2015.   
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
   
 At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's cash balances were $3,289 and $161, respectively.  The Company's accounts receivable totaled $Nil and $32,922 respectively.   

24 

At June 30, 2015, the Company's working capital deficit was $2,265,545 of which $470,439 of convertible debentures were due in the current year and in default.   
   
 To fully carry out the Company's business plans the Company needs to raise a substantial amount of additional capital, or obtain industry joint venture financing. The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to raise such capital or enter into any other beneficial business arrangements. The Company has limited financial resources until such time that it is able to generate such additional financing or cash flow from operations. The Company's ability to establish profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon its ability to exploit its mineral holdings, generate revenue from its planned business operations and control exploration cost.  Should the Company be unable to raise adequate capital or to meet the other above objectives, it is likely that the Company would have to substantially curtail its business activity, and that the Company's investors would incur substantial losses of their investment. 
   
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements the Company is an independent oil and gas company with a limited operating history and losses since inception. These factors, among others, may indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for reasonable period of time. 
   
 The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, and ultimately, to attain profitability. The Company intends to acquire additional operating capital through debt or equity offerings, or through joint ventures or other business arrangements, to fund its business plan.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds. 
   
  Cash Flows:   Net cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to the conveyance of the Company s oil producing assets to Vast Exploration, LLC, a related party.   For the nine months ending at June 30, 2016, cash used by operating activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities by $203,016.  For the nine months ending at June 30 2015, cash used by operating activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities by $193,263. 
   
 Cash flows used by investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $77 from the change in value of the Company s reclamation bond. 
   
 The Cash flows provided by financing activities were $206,382 and $16,164 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   The Company entered into a Line of Credit agreement with related party Vast Exploration, LLC as a means to provide cash flow for ongoing capital needs of the Company.   
   
  Commitments:  As noted in Item 3 of this Report, on or about August 1, 2013, the North Dakota Industrial Commission ( NDIC ) submitted an administrative complaint to the State of North Dakota related to plugging and remediation of the Company s Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells in Crosby, ND.  The administrative complaint alleges the Company violated certain portions of the North Dakota Century Code and request administrative relief against the Company for violation of sections of the North Dakota Administrative Code governing the oil and gas industry. 
   
 On February 18, 2014, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement with the State of North Dakota whereby the Company was required to finish reclamation work, by June 30, 2014, on the two waste water storage pits adjacent to the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells respectively.  The Consent Agreement required the Company to plug the  production zone  of the Jenks #1 well. Once plugging was completed, the Company could then apply for a permit to convert the Jenks #1 well into a salt water disposal well.  As a part of the Consent Agreement the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of no less than $105,000, consisting of $25,000 due and payable upon execution of the Consent Agreement and a $16,000 installment payment per month for five successive months thereafter.  If the Company failed to comply with the terms of the Consent Agreement, the Company would be subject to penalties of up to an additional $420,000 (over and above the $105,000 penalty agreed to in the Consent Agreement). The Company made the initial $25,000 payment and subsequently made each monthly payment with the final installment of $16,000 paid to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.   
   
 The Company made the final installment payment of $16,000 to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.  As of September 30, 2014 the Company has completed substantially all reclamation work and has paid all fines assessed. 
   
 On July 10, 2014, the Company completed reclamation work on both the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 waste water storage pits.  Although reclamation work was to have been completed by June 30, 2014, unseasonably heavy rains saturated the soil and limited safe access to the site by heavy equipment delayed scheduled reclamation until such time as ground conditions improved. The Company also completed plugging of the  production zone  on the Jenks #1 well and set a balance plug on the Knudsen #1 well bore.   

25 

Due to the Company s failure to timely submit a cost estimate for the final plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1 well and site, the NDIC, on January 28, 2015, pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588 ordered JayHawk to file a $120,000 bond covering the Jenks #1. The bond was a plugging and reclamation bond.  
   
 On May 9, 2015, the Company received a copy of a Summons and Complaint filed by the State of North Dakota and the NDIC in the Northwest Judicial District Court of North Dakota alleging JayHawk had violated N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08 by failing to post the $120,000 plugging and reclamation bond pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588. N.D.C.C.   38-08-16 provides that anyone who violates a provision of N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08, or any rule or regulation of the Commission is subject to a penalty of up to $12,500 for each offense, and each day s violation is a separate offense. The Complaint s prayer for relief requested that JayHawk be ordered to deposit $120,000 with the Bank of North Dakota to satisfy the Commission s requirement for the plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1 well. The NDIC also requested that JayHawk pay a fine of $12,500 per day beginning February 4, 2015, for failure to provide a plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1. Company management subsequently met with the NDIC, which resulted in the NDIC staying the litigation subject to JayHawk s immediate plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1. In September of 2015 the Company completed final plugging and abandonment of the Jenks #1 and completed a partial reclamation of the well and site.  
   
 On February 12, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Staff of the Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas with respect to a Penalty Order served by the Company for failure to comply with certain portions of the Kansas Administrative Regulations.  The Company was found in violation of failure to plug, return to service or temporarily abandon 71 wells and assessed a $7,100 penalty, of which $3,100 was payable immediately, a $2,000 payment due by April 1, 2015 and the final $2,000 payment by May 1, 2015.  The Company has subsequently submitted seventy-one (71) temporary abandonment applications, of which seventy-one (71 applications were approved.  The Company has up to one year to plug the wells, return them to service or file additional temporary abandonment applications.   
   
 Subsequent to the report date covering the period ending June 30, 2016, on August 29, 2016, the complaint by the North Dakota Industrial Commission was dismissed without prejudice.  Consequently, the contingency related to reclamation of the Jenks and Knudsen well sites has been relieved.  
   
 At June 30, 2016, the Company has no commitments to make any capital expenditures.  Any potential future capital expenditures will be dependent on concluding adequate and successful financing arrangements. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.  
   
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
               
    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
   
 Not required for Smaller Reporting Companies.  
   
    Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
   
 (a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by JayHawk s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) as of June 30, 2016.  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, JayHawk s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
   
 Management of JayHawk Energy, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 

26 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
   
     Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 
   
     Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and 
   
     Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
   
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
   
 The Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). As a result of this assessment, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
   
 The material weakness identified is described below: 
   
 Due to insufficient staffing, it was not possible to ensure appropriate segregation of duties between incompatible functions, and formalized monitoring procedures have not been established or implemented. 
   
 As a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016,  the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
   
 This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Company was not required to have, nor has it, engaged its independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Quarterly Report 
   
  (b)  Changes in Internal Controls    Our management, including the CEO and CFO, identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.   
   
    PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  
   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  
   
 No director, officer or affiliate of JayHawk Energy, Inc. and no owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company s securities or any associate of any such director, officer or security holder is a party adverse to JayHawk Energy, Inc. or has a material interest adverse to JayHawk Energy, Inc. in reference to pending litigation. 

27 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
