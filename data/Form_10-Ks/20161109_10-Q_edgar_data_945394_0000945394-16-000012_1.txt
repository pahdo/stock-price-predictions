  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (dollars in thousands, except share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Hospitality Properties Trust and its subsidiaries, or HPT, we, our or us, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our   2015   Annual Report. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included in these condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HPT and our subsidiaries, all of which are   100%   owned directly or indirectly by HPT. All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Our operating results for interim periods and those of our managers and tenants are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. Reclassifications have been made to the prior years  condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets, impairment of real estate and the valuation of intangible assets. 
  We have determined that each of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, is a variable interest entity, or VIE, as defined under the Consolidation Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification .   We have concluded that we must consolidate each of our TRSs because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs  economic performance and we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from each VIE that could be significant to the VIE, and are, therefore, the primary beneficiary of each VIE.  The assets of our TRSs were   $35,150   and   $26,559   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and consist primarily of amounts due from, and working capital advances to, certain of their hotel managers.  The liabilities of our TRSs were   $100,848   and   $68,921   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and consist primarily of security deposits they hold from and amounts payable to certain of their hotel managers.  The assets of our TRSs are available to satisfy our TRSs  obligations and we have guaranteed certain obligations of our TRSs. 

Note 2.  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2015-02,   Consolidation  . Among other things, this update changed how an entity determines the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheets as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, and ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  , which addresses the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements. The implementation of these updates resulted in the reclassification of certain of our capitalized debt issuance costs as an offset to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The classification of capitalized debt issuance costs related to our unsecured revolving credit facility remains unchanged in accordance with ASU No. 2015-15. As of   December 31, 2015  , debt issuance costs related to our unsecured term loan and senior unsecured notes of   $2,244   and   $10,556  , respectively, were reclassified from assets to an offset to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which changes how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted subject to certain conditions. Currently, changes in fair value of these investments are recorded through other comprehensive income. Under this ASU, these changes will be recorded through earnings. We are continuing to evaluate this guidance, but we expect the implementation of this guidance will affect how changes in the fair value of available for sale equity investments we hold are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  , Leases  , which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which requires that entities use a new forward looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3.  Revenue Recognition 
  We report hotel operating revenues for managed hotels in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We generally recognize hotel operating revenues, consisting primarily of room and food and beverage sales, when goods and services are provided. 
  We report rental income for leased hotels and travel centers in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We recognize rental income from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease agreements except for   one   lease in which there is uncertainty regarding the collection of scheduled future rent increases.  Rental income includes   $2,932   and   $10,377   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3,752   and   $5,807   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, of adjustments necessary to record scheduled rent increases under certain of our leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our leases with TravelCenters of America LLC, or TA, and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis.  See Note 10 for further information regarding our TA leases.  Due from related persons includes   $39,175   and

$29,122   and other assets, includes   $2,165   and   $1,841   of straight line rent receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We determine percentage rent due to us under our leases annually and recognize it when all contingencies have been met and the rent is earned. We had deferred estimated percentage rent of   $408   and   $937   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  We had no deferred estimated percentage rent for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  In connection with our June 2015 lease modification with TA, we recorded   $2,048   of percentage rent during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   because the amount was no longer contingent. See Note 10 for further information regarding our TA leases. 
  We own all the FF E reserve escrows for our hotels. We report deposits by our third party tenants into the escrow accounts as FF E reserve income.  We do not report the amounts which are escrowed as FF E reserves for our managed hotels as FF E reserve income. 

Note 4.  Weighted Average Common Shares 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the weighted average number of common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

  Distributions 
  On each of January 15, 2016, April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016 and October 17, 2016, we paid a   $0.4453   per share distribution, or   $5,166  , to our Series D preferred shareholders. 
  On February 23, 2016, we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record on January 22, 2016 of   $0.50   per share, or   $75,774  . On May 19, 2016, we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record on April 25, 2016 of   $0.51   per share, or   $77,289  .  On August 17, 2016, we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record on July 22, 2016 of   $0.51   per share, or   $77,295  .  On October 11, 2016, we declared a regular quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on October 21, 2016 of   $0.51   per share, or   $83,777  .  We expect to pay this amount on or about November 17, 2016. 
  Share Issuance and Purchases 
  On May 25, 2016, we granted   2,500   of our common shares, valued at   $25.50   per share, the closing price of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on that day, to each of our   five   Trustees as part of their annual compensation. 
  On August 19, 2016, we sold   11,000,000   of our common shares at a price of   $30.75   per share in a public offering. On August 26, 2016, we sold   1,650,000   of our common shares at a price of   $30.75   per share pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters.  Net proceeds from these sales were   $371,956   after underwriters' discount and other offering expenses.  
  On September 15, 2016, pursuant to our 2012 Equity Compensation Plan, we granted an aggregate of   79,100   of our common shares to our officers and to other employees of our manager, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, valued at   $28.57   per share, the closing price of our common shares on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, on that day.

On September 26, 2016, we purchased an aggregate of   19,677   of our common shares for   $29.64   per common share, the closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq on that day, from certain of our officers and other employees of RMR LLC in satisfaction of tax withholding and payment obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of our common shares. 
  Cumulative Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  Cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) represents the unrealized gain (loss) on our available for sale equity investments and our share of the comprehensive income (loss) of Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC. See Notes 10 and 12 for further information regarding these investments. 

Note 6.  Indebtedness 
  Our principal debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   were: (1)   $150,000   of outstanding borrowings under our   $1,000,000   unsecured revolving credit facility; (2) our   $400,000   unsecured term loan; (3) an aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $2,600,000   of public issuances of unsecured senior notes; and (4) our public issuance of   $8,478   outstanding principal amount of convertible senior unsecured notes. 
  Our   $1,000,000   revolving credit facility is available for general business purposes, including acquisitions.  The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is   July 15, 2018   and, subject to our payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by   one   year to   July 15, 2019  . We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. We are required to pay interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility at an annual rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 110 basis points as of   September 30, 2016  . We also pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments, which was 20 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016   under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was   1.62%  . The weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.60%   and   1.55%   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   1.30%   and   1.28%   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and November 8, 2016, we had   $150,000   and   $70,000   outstanding under our revolving credit facility, respectively. 
  Our   $400,000   term loan, which matures on   April 15, 2019  , is prepayable without penalty at any time.  We are required to pay interest on the amounts under our term loan at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 120 basis points as of   September 30, 2016  .  The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based on changes to our credit ratings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our term loan was   1.72%  . The weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our term loan was   1.69%   and   1.65%   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   1.39%   and   1.38%   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  Our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan also includes a feature under which maximum aggregate borrowings may be increased up to   $2,300,000   on a combined basis in certain circumstances.  Our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan and our notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager. Our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan and our senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain a number of covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts or to make distributions under certain circumstances and generally require us to maintain certain financial ratios. We believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan and our senior notes indentures and their supplements at   September 30, 2016  . 
  On February 3, 2016, we issued   $750,000   aggregate principal amount of senior notes in public offerings, which included   $400,000   aggregate principal amount of   4.25%   senior notes due 2021 and   $350,000   aggregate principal amount   5.25%   senior notes due 2026.  Net proceeds from these offerings were   $731,506   after original issue discounts and offering expenses. 
  On March 11, 2016, we redeemed at par all of our outstanding   6.30%   senior notes due 2016 for a redemption price equal to the principal amount of   $275,000  , plus accrued and unpaid interest (an aggregate of   $279,139  ). As a result of the redemption, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $  70   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represented the unamortized discounts and issuance costs of these notes.

  TA  : TA was our   100%   owned subsidiary until we distributed its common shares to our shareholders in 2007. TA is our largest tenant and property operator, leasing   37%   of our gross carrying value of real estate properties as of   September 30, 2016  . We are TA s largest shareholder; as of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   3,420,000   of TA s common shares, representing approximately   8.8%   of TA s outstanding common shares. 
  Our investment in TA shares, which is included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, is recorded at fair value with the related unrealized gain (loss) included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We recognize the increase or decrease in the fair value of our TA shares each reporting period as unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities, which is a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See Note 12 for further information regarding our investment in TA. 
  On June 1, 2015, we entered a transaction agreement with TA. On June 22, 2016, we and TA amended the transaction agreement. We refer to the amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to purchase from TA   four   travel centers upon the completion of their development at a purchase price equal to their development costs, including the cost of the land, and   two   existing travel centers then owned by TA and we agreed to lease back these properties to TA under our TA leases.  
  In connection with the Transaction Agreement, as amended: 
             
    On March 31, 2016, we purchased   one   of the development properties from TA for   $19,683   and we and TA amended our TA No. 4 agreement to add this property and our annual minimum rent under our TA No. 4 agreement increased by   $1,673  .

We and TA also amended our TA No. 5 agreement to extend its term to 2032. 
                
    On June 30, 2016, we purchased   one   of the development properties from TA for   $22,297   and we and TA amended our TA No. 2 agreement to add this property and our annual minimum rent under our TA No. 2 agreement increased by   $1,895  .

    We currently expect to purchase the   one   remaining development property from TA in the first quarter of 2017 at a purchase price equal to its development cost not to exceed   $29,000  . 
     Because of the relationships between us and TA, the terms of the Transaction Agreement, as amended, were negotiated and approved by special committees of our Board of Trustees and the TA board of directors composed of our Independent Trustees and TA s independent directors who are not also trustees or directors of the other party, which committees were represented by separate counsel.

These management agreements were added to our existing pooling agreement with Sonesta.

Pursuant to the amendment, these stipulated measurement periods begin on the later of January 1, 2017 and January 1st of the year beginning at least   18 months   following the effective date of the applicable management agreement. The amendment to the pooling agreement and management agreements with Sonesta were negotiated and recommended by a Special Committee of our Board of Trustees comprised solely of our Independent Trustees, and were approved by our Independent Trustees and also by our Board of Trustees. 
  In July 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire a full service hotel with   236   rooms located in Milpitas, CA for a purchase price of   $52,000  , excluding acquisition related costs. We subsequently terminated that agreement and in October 2016 we entered into a new agreement to acquire this hotel for   $46,000  , excluding acquisition related costs.  We currently expect to complete this acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2016. This acquisition is subject to closing conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will acquire this property or that its acquisition will not be delayed or the terms of the acquisition will not change. Upon acquisition of this hotel, we intend to rebrand this hotel as a Sonesta hotel, to enter into a hotel management agreement with Sonesta for this property on terms consistent with our other Sonesta hotel management agreements. See Note 11 for further information regarding our Sonesta agreement.

  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in AIC had a carrying value of   $7,117   and   $6,834  , respectively. These amounts are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We recognized income (loss) of   $13   and   ($24)   related to our investment in AIC for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $107   and   $71   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our other comprehensive income includes our proportionate part of unrealized gains (losses) on securities which are owned by AIC of   $80   and (  $72  ) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $175   and (  $91  ) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Directors  and Officers  Liability Insurance  :  We, RMR Inc., RMR LLC and certain companies to which RMR LLC provides management services participate in a combined directors  and officers  liability insurance policy. In September 2016, we participated in a   one year   extension of this combined directors  and officers  insurance policy through September 2018. Our premium for this policy extension was approximately   $141  .

Note 11. Hotel Management Agreements and Leases 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   302   of our hotels are leased to our TRSs and managed by independent hotel operating companies and   three   of our hotels are leased. 
  Marriott No. 1 agreement  . Our management agreement with Marriott International, Inc., or Marriott, for   53   hotels provides that as of   September 30, 2016   we are to be paid an annual minimum return of   $68,583   to the extent that gross revenues of the hotels, after payment of hotel operating expenses and funding of the FF E reserve, are sufficient to do so.  We do not have any security deposits or guarantees for our minimum returns from the 53 hotels included in our Marriott No. 1 agreement.  Accordingly, the minimum returns we receive from these hotels managed by Marriott are limited to available hotel cash flows after payment of operating expenses and funding of the FF E reserve. Marriott s base and incentive management fees are only earned after we receive our minimum returns.  We realized minimum returns of   $17,126   and   $17,046   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and minimum returns of   $51,361   and   $51,080   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under this agreement. We also realized additional returns of   $4,372   and   $10,621   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which represents our share of hotel cash flows in excess of the minimum returns due to us for the period.  We realized additional returns of   $3,149   under this agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  We funded   $2,265   for capital improvements at certain of the hotels included in our Marriott No. 1 agreement during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We currently expect to fund   $750   for capital improvements during the   2016   fourth quarter under this agreement. As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum returns payable to us increase by   10%   of the amounts funded. 
  Marriott No. 234 agreement.    Our management agreement with Marriott for   68   hotels provides that as of   September 30, 2016   we are to be paid an annual minimum return of   $106,243  .

Pursuant to our Marriott No. 234 agreement, Marriott has provided us with a security deposit to cover minimum return payment shortfalls, if any.  Under this agreement, this security deposit may be replenished and increased up to   $64,700   from our share of hotel cash flows in excess of the minimum returns due to us and certain management fees. Marriott s base and incentive management fees are only earned after we receive our minimum returns. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our available security deposit was replenished by   $11,198   from our share of hotel cash flows in excess of the minimum returns due to us for the period.  The available balance of this deposit was   $17,449   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Pursuant to our Marriott No. 234 agreement, Marriott has also provided us with a limited guarantee which expires in 2019 for shortfalls up to   90%   of our minimum returns, if and after the available security deposit has been depleted. The available balance of the guarantee was   $30,672   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  We did not make any fundings for capital improvements to our Marriott No. 234 hotels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We currently expect to fund   $9,000   for capital improvements to certain hotels under our Marriott No. 234 agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter. As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum returns payable to us increase by   9%   of the amounts funded.  
  Marriott No. 5 agreement  . We lease   one   hotel in Kauai, HI to Marriott. This lease is guaranteed by Marriott and we realized   $2,529   of rent for this hotel during each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $7,587   of rent during each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The guarantee provided by Marriott with respect to this leased hotel is unlimited. On August 31, 2016, Marriott notified us that it will not exercise its renewal option at the expiration of the current lease term ending on December 31, 2019. Marriott has   four   renewal options for   15   years each. 
  InterContinental agreement.   Our management agreement with InterContinental for   94   hotels provides that as of   September 30, 2016  , we are to be paid annual minimum returns and rents of   $160,338  .  We realized minimum returns and rents of   $40,084   and   $37,444   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and minimum returns and rents of   $118,372   and   $109,461   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under this agreement.  We also realized additional returns under this agreement of   $3,563   and   $2,607   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and of   $7,467  and   $5,784   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, from our share of hotel cash flows in excess of our minimum returns and rents due to us for those periods.

Pursuant to our InterContinental agreement, InterContinental has provided us with a security deposit to cover minimum payment shortfalls, if any.  Under this agreement, InterContinental is required to maintain a minimum security deposit of   $37,000   and this security deposit may be replenished and increased up to   $100,000   from a share of future cash flows from the hotels, in excess of our minimum returns and certain management fees. 
  On March 16, 2016, we amended our management agreement with InterContinental in connection with our acquisition of the Kimpton Hotel Monaco located in Portland, OR. See Note 7 for further information regarding this acquisition. As a result of the amendment, the annual minimum returns due to us increased by an aggregate of   8%   of our investment in the hotel (  $9,120  ) and InterContinental provided us   $9,000   to supplement the existing security deposit. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the available security deposit was replenished by   $23,747   from a share of the hotels  cash flows in excess of the minimum payments due to us for the period.  The available balance of this security deposit was   $70,963   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We did not make any fundings for capital improvements to our InterContinental hotels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We currently expect to fund   $17,500   for capital improvements to certain hotels under our InterContinental agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter. As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum returns and rents payable to us increase by   8%   of the amounts funded. 
  Sonesta agreement.   Our Sonesta agreement provides that we are to be paid an annual minimum return (  $85,964   as of   September 30, 2016  ) equal to   8%   of our invested capital, as defined in the agreement, to the extent that gross revenues of the hotels, after payment of hotel operating expenses, including certain management fees to Sonesta, are sufficient to do so.  We do not have a security deposit or guarantee for our hotels managed by Sonesta.  Accordingly, the returns we currently receive from hotels managed by Sonesta are limited to available hotel cash flows after payment of operating expenses. Sonesta s incentive management fees, but not its other fees, are only earned after we receive our minimum returns and an imputed FF E escrow. We realized returns of   $19,133   and   $13,186   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and returns of   $51,279   and   $39,985   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under this agreement. 
  Our Sonesta agreement does not require FF E escrow deposits and we are required to fund capital expenditures made at our Sonesta hotels.  We funded   $44,017   for renovations and other capital improvements to hotels included in our Sonesta agreement during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We currently expect to fund   $23,860   for renovations and other capital improvements during the 2016 fourth quarter under this agreement.  The annual minimum returns due to us under the Sonesta agreement increase by   8%   of the amounts funded in excess of threshold amounts, as defined therein. See Note 10 for further information regarding our relationship with Sonesta. 
  Wyndham agreements  . Our management agreement with Wyndham Hotel Group, or Wyndham, for   22   hotels provides that as of   September 30, 2016  , we are to be paid annual minimum returns of   $26,805  .  We realized returns of   $6,687   and   $6,599   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and returns of   $20,009   and   $19,706   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under this agreement. Pursuant to our Wyndham agreement, Wyndham has provided us with a guarantee, which is limited to   $35,656   (  $3,416   remaining at   September 30, 2016  ), subject to an annual payment limit of   $17,828  , and expires on July 28, 2020. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Wyndham made   $592   of guaranty payments to us. 
  We also lease   48   vacation units in   one   of our hotels to Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc., a subsidiary of Wyndham, or Wyndham Vacation, which requires annual minimum rents to us of   $1,366  .  The guarantee provided by Wyndham with respect to the Wyndham Vacation lease for part of one hotel is unlimited.  We realized rents of   $341   and   $332   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and rents of   $1,024   and   $994   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, under our Wyndham agreements. 
  Under our Wyndham agreement, the FF E reserve funding required for all hotels included in the agreement is subject to available cash flows after payment of our minimum return.  The reserve amount is   4%   of total hotel sales in   2016   and increases to   5%   of total hotel sales in   2017   through the end of the agreement term in 2038.  No FF E escrow deposits were made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to insufficient available cash flows generated at these hotels. 
  We funded   $2,439   for capital improvements to certain hotels included in our Wyndham agreement during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We currently expect to fund   $2,000   for capital improvements to certain hotels during the   2016

fourth quarter under this agreement.  As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum returns payable to us increase by   8%   of the amounts funded. 
  TA agreements.      Our   198   owned travel centers are leased to and operated by a subsidiary of TA under   five   agreements.  Our TA Nos. 1, 2 and 5 leases for   40   travel centers each expire in 2029, 2028 and 2032, respectively, and have   two     15   year renewal options. Our TA Nos. 3 and 4 leases for   39   travel centers each expire in 2026 and 2030, respectively, and each have   two     15   year renewal options. TA has guaranteed its subsidiary tenants  obligations under these leases. Our travel center leases with TA do not require FF E escrow deposits. However, TA is required to maintain the leased travel centers, including structural and non-structural components. Under all of our TA leases, TA may request that we fund capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases. TA is not obligated to request and we are not obligated to fund any such improvements. We funded   $75,314   for capital improvements to our travel center properties during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We currently expect to fund approximately   $30,000   for renovations and other capital improvements during the   2016   fourth quarter. As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum rents payable to us increase by   8.5%   of the amounts funded. See Note 10 for further information about our TA leases.  
  Other management agreement and lease matters.   As of November 8, 2016, all payments due to us from our managers and tenants under our other operating agreements were current.  Minimum return and minimum rent payments due to us under some of these other hotel management agreements and leases are supported by guarantees.  The guarantee provided by Hyatt Hotels Corporation, or Hyatt, with respect to the   22   hotels managed by Hyatt is limited to   $50,000   (  $18,654   remaining at   September 30, 2016  ).  The guarantee provided by Carlson with respect to the   11   hotels managed by Carlson is limited to   $40,000   (  $29,047   remaining at   September 30, 2016  ). 
  Guarantees and security deposits generally.     When we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold for payment deficiencies at our managed and leased hotels, we record income equal to the amounts by which this deposit is reduced up to the minimum return or minimum rent due to us. However, reducing the security deposits does not result in additional cash flows to us of the deficiency amounts, but reducing amounts of security deposits may reduce the refunds due to the respective lessees or managers who have provided us with these deposits upon expiration of the respective lease or management agreement. The security deposits are non-interest bearing and are not held in escrow. Under these agreements, any amount of the security deposits which are applied to payment deficits may be replenished from a share of future cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective agreements. 
  Net operating results of our managed hotel portfolios exceeded the minimum returns due to us in both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Certain of our managed hotel portfolios had net operating results that were, in the aggregate,   $2,248   and   $6,560   less than the minimum returns due to us in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $12,618   and   $17,395   less than the minimum returns due to us for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.      When the managers of these hotels fund these shortfalls under the terms of our operating agreements or their guarantees, we reflect such fundings (including security deposit applications) in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a reduction of hotel operating expenses.     There was   no   reduction to hotel operating expenses in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and reductions of     $592   and   $1,295   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as a result of such fundings. We had shortfalls at certain of our managed hotel portfolios not funded by the managers of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements of   $2,248   and   $6,560  , and   $12,026   and   $16,100   in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which represent the unguaranteed portions of our minimum returns from Sonesta.   
  Certain of our managed hotel portfolios had net operating results that were, in the aggregate,   $35,123   and   $28,969   more than the minimum returns due to us in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $80,867   and   $65,973   more than the minimum returns due to us in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.     Certain of our guarantees and our security deposits may be replenished by a share of these excess cash flows from the applicable hotel operations in excess of the minimum returns due to us pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements.      When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses.      Hotel operating expenses were increased by   $15,103     and   $11,970     in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $33,897   and   $27,551   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as a result of such replenishments. 

Note 12.  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

     Table of Contents  

The table below presents certain of our assets carried at fair value at   September 30, 2016  , categorized by the level of inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP, used in the valuation of each asset. 

(1) 
    Our   3,420,000   common shares of TA, which are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are reported at fair value which is based on quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs).  Our historical cost basis for these shares is   $17,407   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The unrealized gain of   $7,080   for these shares as of   September 30, 2016   is included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    Our   2,503,777   shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc., which are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are reported at fair value which is based on quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs).  Our historical cost basis for these shares is   $66,374   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The unrealized gain of   $28,619   for these shares as of   September 30, 2016   is included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
     In addition to the investment securities included in the table above, our financial instruments include our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents receivable, revolving credit facility, term loan, senior notes and security deposits. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of these additional financial instruments     approximated their carrying values in our condensed consolidated balance sheets due to their short term nature or variable interest rates, except as follows: 

(1) 
    Carrying value includes unamortized discounts and certain issuance costs. 
              (2) 
    These senior notes were redeemed at par plus accrued interest in March 2016. 
              (3) 
    These senior notes were redeemed at par plus accrued interest in September 2016. 
      At   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair values of our senior notes using an average of the bid and ask price of our then outstanding issuances of senior notes (Level 2 inputs).  We estimated the fair value of our convertible senior notes using discounted cash flow analyses and currently prevailing market interest rates (Level 3 inputs) because no market quotes or other observable inputs for these notes were available at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our   2015   Annual Report. We are a REIT organized under Maryland law. 

Overview (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts) 
  Management agreements and leases  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we owned   305   hotels operated under nine agreements;   302   of these hotels are leased by us to our wholly owned TRSs and managed by hotel operating companies and   three   are leased to hotel operating companies.  At   September 30, 2016  , our   198   owned travel centers are leased to TA under five agreements. Our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income include operating revenues and expenses of our managed hotels and rental income from our leased hotels and travel centers.  
  Many of our operating agreements contain security features, such as guarantees and security deposits, which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our agreements regardless of property performance. However, the effectiveness of various security features to provide us uninterrupted receipt of minimum returns and rents is not assured, especially if economic conditions generally decline for a prolonged period. Also, certain of the guarantees that we hold are limited in amount and duration and do not provide for payment of the entire amount of the applicable minimum returns. If our tenants, managers or guarantors do not earn or pay the minimum returns and rents due to us, our cash flows will decline and we may be unable to repay our debt, fund our debt service obligations, pay distributions to our shareholders or the amounts of our distributions may decline. 
  Hotel operations  . During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the U.S. hotel industry generally realized increases in average daily rate, or ADR, and revenue per available room, or RevPAR, when compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The U.S. hotel industry generally realized stable occupancy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the 2015 periods. As a result, the growth in RevPAR for the U.S. hotel industry has generally been lower in 2016 compared to 2015. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2015 have produced year over year increases in RevPAR and occupancy in excess of the hotel industry generally that we believe are, in part, a result of recent renovations we made to our hotels.  However, we believe that certain of our hotels acquired since January 1, 2015 were negatively impacted by brand conversions and by the disruption and displacement caused by our renovation activities at those hotels during 2015 and the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for our 293 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since July 1, 2015: ADR increased 3.3% to $126.58; occupancy increased 0.4 percentage points to 80.4%; and RevPAR increased 3.8% to $101.77. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for our   305   hotels: ADR increased 3.0% to $126.69; occupancy increased 0.4 percentage points to 80.0%; and RevPAR increased 3.5% to $101.35. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for our 291 comparable hotels that we owned continuously since January 1, 2015: ADR increased 3.4% to $125.95; occupancy increased 0.8 percentage points to 78.1%; and RevPAR increased 4.5% to $98.37. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for our   305   hotels: ADR increased 3.1% to $125.94; occupancy increased 0.1 percentage points to 77.3%; and RevPAR increased 3.2% to $97.35. 
  Additional details of our hotel operating agreements and agreements with TA are set forth in Notes 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the table and notes thereto on pages 32 through 34 below.

The increase in hotel operating revenues is a result of increased revenues at certain of our managed hotels due to increases in ADR and higher occupancies ($25,987) and the effects of our hotel acquisitions since July 1, 2015 ($10,313) partially offset by decreased revenues at certain of our managed hotels as a result of lower occupancies compared to the 2015 period ($8,511) and decreased revenues at certain hotels undergoing renovations during all or part of the   2016   period primarily resulting in lower occupancies ($787).  Additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page 35. 
  Rental income - hotels.    The increase in rental income - hotels is a result of contractual rent increases under certain of our hotel leases and increases in the minimum rents due to us as we funded improvements at certain of our leased hotels since July 1, 2015.  Rental income - hotels for the   2016   and   2015   periods includes $109 and $105, respectively, of adjustments to record rent on a straight line basis.

Rental income - travel centers.    The increase in rental income - travel centers is a result of increases in the minimum rents due to us from TA for our travel center acquisitions since July 1, 2015 ($3,115) and for improvements we purchased at certain of our travel centers since July 1, 2015 ($2,027), partially offset by a decrease in straight line rent adjustments related to previously deferred rent amounts under our TA leases ($824).  Rental income - travel centers for the   2016   and   2015   periods includes $2,823 and $3,647, respectively, of adjustments necessary to record scheduled rent increases under our TA leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our TA leases and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis. 
  FF E Reserve income.    FF E reserve income represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us, the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures. The terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels. We do not report the amounts, if any, which are escrowed as FF E reserves for our managed hotels as FF E reserve income. The increase in FF E reserve income is the result of increased sales at certain of our leased hotels and an increased FF E contribution percentage required by one of our hotel leases. 
  Hotel operating expenses.    The increase in hotel operating expenses is a result of our hotel acquisitions since July 1, 2015 ($6,665), an increase in wage and benefit costs, sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs at certain of our managed hotels resulting primarily from higher occupancies ($4,405) and an increase in the amount of guaranty and security deposit replenishments under certain of our hotel management agreements ($3,134), partially offset by operating expense decreases at certain managed hotels undergoing renovations during the 2016 period due to lower occupancies ($795). Certain of our guarantees and our security deposits which have been applied to payment deficits may be replenished from a share of subsequent cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements.  When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses. 
  Depreciation and amortization - hotels.   The increase in depreciation and amortization - hotels is due to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from our FF E reserves or directly funded by us since July 1, 2015 ($2,330) and our hotel acquisitions since July 1, 2015 ($2,072), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since July 1, 2015 ($2,105). 
  Depreciation and amortization - travel centers.    The increase in depreciation and amortization - travel centers is due to the depreciation and amortization of travel center improvements we purchased since July 1, 2015 ($2,577) and the effect of our travel center acquisitions since July 1, 2015 ($1,043), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since July 1, 2015 ($39). 
  General and administrative.    The increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to     an increase in estimated business management incentive fees ($16,475) and higher professional services and stock compensation costs ($1,433). 
  Acquisition related costs.   Acquisition related costs represent legal and other costs incurred in connection with our acquisition activities. 
  Operating income.   The decrease in operating income in the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above. 
  Dividend income.   Dividend income represents dividends received during the   2016   period from our investment in RMR Inc.   
  Interest income.    The increase in interest income is due to higher average cash balances during the   2016   period. 
  Interest expense.    The increase in interest expense is due to higher average borrowings and a higher weighted average interest rate in the   2016   period. 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt  . We recorded a $158 loss on early extinguishment of debt in the 2016 period in connection with our redemption of certain senior notes. 
  Income tax expense.    The increase in income tax expense is due primarily to higher foreign taxes in the   2016   period due to an increase in the amount of certain foreign sourced income subject to income taxes and higher state income taxes as a result of a higher estimated effective state tax rate compared to the 2015 period.  
  Equity in earnings of an investee.    Equity in earnings of an investee represents our proportionate share of earnings of AIC.

Net income and net income available for common shareholders.   The decrease in net income and net income available for common shareholders in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above. The percentage decrease in net income available for common shareholders per common share is higher primarily as a result of the higher number of weighted average common shares outstanding for the 2016 period due to our issuance of common shares pursuant to a public offering in August 2016.

  Hotel operating revenues.    The increase in hotel operating revenues is a result of increased revenues at certain of our managed hotels due to increases in ADR and higher occupancies ($76,285) and the effects of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2015 ($32,322), partially offset by decreased revenues at certain of our managed hotels as a result of lower occupancies compared to the   2015   period ($19,023) and decreased revenues at certain of our hotels as a result of undergoing

renovations during all or part of the 2016 period primarily resulting in lower occupancies ($742).  Additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page 35. 
  Rental income - hotels.    The increase in rental income - hotels is a result of contractual rent increases under certain of our hotel leases and increases in the minimum rents due to us as we funded improvements at certain of our leased hotels since January 1, 2015.  Rental income - hotels for the   2016   and   2015   periods includes $324 and $355, respectively, of adjustments to record rent on a straight line basis.   
  Rental income - travel centers.    The increase in rental income - travel centers is a result of increases in the minimum rents due to us from TA for our travel center acquisitions since January 1, 2015 ($14,289) and improvements we purchased at certain of our travel centers since January 1, 2015 ($8,972) and an increase in straight line rent adjustments related to previously deferred rent amounts under our TA leases ($4,601), partially offset by a decrease in rents related to our sale of five travel centers in June 2015 ($2,086) and a decrease in percentage rent ($2,048). Rental income - travel centers for the   2016   and   2015   periods includes $10,053 and $5,452, respectively, of adjustments necessary to record scheduled rent increases under our TA leases, the deferred rent obligations payable to us under our TA leases and the estimated future payments to us under our TA leases for the cost of removing underground storage tanks on a straight line basis. 
  FF E Reserve income.    The increase in FF E reserve income is the result of increased sales at certain of our leased hotels and an increased FF E contribution percentage required by one of our hotel leases. 
  Hotel operating expenses.    The increase in hotel operating expenses is a result of an increase in wage and benefit costs, sales and marketing expenses and other operating costs at certain of our managed hotels resulting primarily from higher occupancies ($25,160), the effect of our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2015 ($18,185), an increase in the amount of security deposits and guarantees replenished under certain of our hotel management agreements ($7,049) and an increase in real estate taxes at certain of our hotels ($3,423), partially offset by operating expense decreases at certain managed hotels undergoing renovations during the 2016 period due to lower occupancies ($1,267).  When our managers fund shortfalls of our minimum returns under the terms of our operating agreements or their guarantees, we reflect such fundings (including security deposit applications) in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a reduction of hotel operating expenses.  Certain of our guarantees and our security deposits which have been applied to payment deficits may be replenished from a share of subsequent cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective operating agreements.  When our guarantees and our security deposits are replenished by cash flows from hotel operations, we reflect such replenishments in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income as an increase to hotel operating expenses. 
  Depreciation and amortization - hotels.   The increase in depreciation and amortization - hotels is due to the effect of the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from our FF E reserves or directly funded by us since January 1, 2015 ($9,154) and our hotel acquisitions since January 1, 2015 ($7,802), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2015 ($8,892). 
  Depreciation and amortization - travel centers.    The increase in depreciation and amortization - travel centers is due to the depreciation and amortization of travel center improvements we purchased since January 1, 2015 ($7,963) and the effect of our travel center acquisitions since January 1, 2015 ($6,479), partially offset by certain of our depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2015 ($126). 
  General and administrative.    The increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to an increase in estimated business management incentive fees ($38,889), partially offset by the amortization of the liability we recorded in connection with our acquisition of RMR Inc. shares in June 2015 and lower professional services costs. 
  Acquisition related costs.   Acquisition related costs represent legal and other costs incurred in connection with our acquisition activities. 
  Operating income.   The increase in operating income in the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts) 
  Our Managers and Tenants 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   303   of our hotels are included in one of   seven   portfolio agreements and   two   of our hotels are not included in a portfolio and are leased to hotel operating companies. Our   198   travel centers are leased under five portfolio agreements. All costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by the hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account. Our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses and for returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and, to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and minimum rents, from their separate resources. Our hotel managers and tenants are Marriott, InterContinental, Sonesta, Wyndham, Hyatt, Carlson and Morgans Hotel Group, or Morgans. Our travel centers are leased to TA. 
  We define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total property level revenues minus all property level expenses and FF E reserve escrows which are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us divided by the minimum returns or minimum rent payments due to us. More detail regarding coverage, guarantees and other features of our hotel operating agreements is presented in the tables and related notes on pages 32 through 34. For the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , three of our nine hotel operating agreements, representing 16% of our total annual minimum returns and minimum rents, generated coverage of less than 1.0x (with a range among those three hotel operating agreements of 0.73x to 0.94x). 
  We define coverage for our travel center leases as property level revenues minus all property level expenses divided by the minimum rent payments due to us.  During the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the operating results from our   198   properties in our five travel center leases generated coverage of 1.59x. Because a large percentage of TA s business is conducted at properties leased from us, property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate TA s ability to pay rents due to us. We believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what an operator interested to acquire these properties or the leaseholds might use to evaluate the contribution of these properties to their earnings before corporate level expenses. 
  Three hundred twenty-two (  322  ) of our properties, representing   58%   of our aggregate annual minimum returns and rents as of   September 30, 2016  , are operated under 10 management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees. These guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us. Our minimum returns and minimum rents for   94   hotels, representing   21%   of our aggregate annual minimum returns and rents as of   September 30, 2016  , are secured by a security deposit which we control. Some of our managers and tenants, or their affiliates, may also supplement cash flows from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees or security deposits. Guarantee payments, security deposit applications or supplemental payments to us, if any, made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations, but, under some of our agreements, the manager or tenant may recover these guarantee or supplemental payments and the security deposits may be replenished from a share of the subsequent cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid.

When cash flows from our hotels under certain of our agreements are less than the minimum returns contractually due to us, we have utilized the applicable security features in our agreements to cover some of these shortfalls. However, several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts, are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire, especially if our hotel renovation and rebranding activities do not result in improved operating results at these hotels. Accordingly, the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured. If any of our hotel managers, tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us, our cash flows will decline and we may become unable to continue to pay distributions to our shareholders or the amount of the distributions may decline. 
  Our Operating Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels, minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly. We may receive additional returns, percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions, if any, either monthly or quarterly, and these amounts are usually subject to an annual true up. This flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating and capital expenses, interest expense on our debt and distributions to shareholders. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, interest expense on our debt and distributions to our shareholders for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. However, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, our managers and tenants may become unable or unwilling to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due, and, as a result, our cash flows and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of, or even eliminate, our distributions to common shareholders. 
  Changes in our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   were as follows: (1) cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from   $374,906   in   2015   to   $360,078   in   2016  ; (2) cash used in investing activities decreased from   $575,254   in   2015   to   $331,249   in   2016  ; and (3) cash flows from financing activities changed from   $195,889   of cash provided by financing activities in   2015   to   $32,977   of cash used in financing activities in   2016  . 
  The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to our payment of an incentive management fee of $62,263 to RMR LLC in January 2016 and higher interest payments, partially offset by an increase in the minimum returns and rents paid to us due to our funding of improvements to our hotels and travel centers, the improved operating performance at certain of our hotels and our acquisitions since January 1, 2015 and an increase in security deposits received and replenished. The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to decreases in our real estate acquisitions and funding of improvements to our properties. The change in cash flows from financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to net debt repayments in the 2016 period compared to the net borrowings in the prior year period partially offset by proceeds from our issuance of common shares in the   2016   period. 
  We maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by meeting certain requirements. As a REIT, we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income; however, the income realized by our TRSs in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate tax rates. In addition, the income we receive from our hotels in Canada and Puerto Rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties despite our qualification for taxation as a REIT. 
  Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Various percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as FF E reserves to fund future capital improvements. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our hotel managers and hotel tenants deposited   $55,518   to these accounts and spent   $48,388   from the FF E reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $60,606   on deposit in these escrow accounts, which was held directly by us and is reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash. 
  Our hotel operating agreements generally provide that, if necessary, we may provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed FF E reserves or when no FF E reserves are available. To the extent we make such additional fundings, our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we funded $48,721 for capital improvements in excess of FF E reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels as follows:

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we funded   $2,265   for capital improvements to hotels included in our Marriott No. 1 agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently expect to fund   $750   for capital improvements under this agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

We did not make any fundings for capital improvements to hotels under our Marriott No. 234 agreement during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We currently expect to fund   $9,000   for capital improvements under this agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the annual minimum returns payable to us increase.

    Our Sonesta agreement does not require FF E escrow deposits. Under our Sonesta agreement, we are required to fund capital expenditures made at our hotels. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we funded   $44,017   for capital improvements to hotels included in our Sonesta agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  We currently expect to fund   $23,860   for capital improvements under this agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

    Our Wyndham agreement requires FF E escrow deposits only if there are excess cash flows after payment of our minimum returns.  No FF E escrow deposits were required during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

We currently expect to fund   $2,000   for capital improvements under this agreement during the   2016   fourth quarter using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we fund these improvements, the minimum returns payable to us increase. 
     Our travel center leases with TA do not require FF E escrow deposits. However, TA is required to maintain the leased travel centers, including structural and non-structural components. Under all of our TA leases, TA may request that we purchase qualifying capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases.  We funded   $75,314   for purchases of capital improvements under these lease provisions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , resulting in TA s annual minimum rent payable to us increasing by   $6,402   pursuant to the leases. We currently expect to fund   $30,000   for capital improvements under these agreements during the remainder of   2016   using cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  TA is not obligated to request and we are not obligated to purchase any such improvements. 
  On each of January 15, 2016, April 15, 2016, July 15, 2016 and October 17, 2016, we paid a   $0.4453   per share distribution, or   $5,166  , to our Series D preferred shareholders. We funded these distributions using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Net proceeds from these offerings of $731,506 after original issue discounts and offering expenses were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes.

  In October 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire a full service hotel with 101 rooms located in Addison, TX for $9,000, excluding acquisition related costs. We currently expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2017 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  In November 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire a full service hotel with 483 rooms located in Chicago, IL for $86,700, excluding acquisition related costs. We currently expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2017 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  We previously agreed to purchase from TA a travel center to be developed after its completion at a purchase price equal to the development cost not to exceed $29,000. We currently expect that the development of this travel center and our acquisition of it will be completed in the first quarter of 2017 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our pending acquisitions are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete these acquisitions or that these acquisitions will not be delayed or the terms of these acquisitions will not change. 
    
  In order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is July 15, 2018 and, subject to our payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by one year to July 15, 2019. We are required to pay interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 110 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  , on the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 20 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  . Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.62%  . As of   September 30, 2016   and November 8,

2016, we had   $150,000   and   $70,000  , respectively, outstanding and $850,000 and $930,000, respectively, available to borrow under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility is governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders, which also governs our term loan. Our   $400,000   term loan, which matures on April 15, 2019, is prepayable without penalty at any time. We are required to pay interest at LIBOR plus a premium, which was 120 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  , on the amount outstanding under our $400,000 term loan.  The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our   $400,000   term loan was   1.72%  . 
  Our credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased up to $2,300,000 on a combined basis in certain circumstances. 
  Our term debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility and term loan) as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows:   $350,000   in   2018  ,   $400,000   in   2021  ,   $500,000   in   2022  ,   $300,000   in   2023  ,   $350,000   in   2024  ,   $350,000   in   2025  ,   $350,000   in   2026   and   $8,478   in 2027. 
  Our $8,478 of 3.8% convertible senior notes due 2027 are convertible, if certain conditions are met (including certain changes in control).  Upon conversion, the holder of notes is entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes and, to the extent the market price of our common shares then exceeds the conversion price of   $49.70   per share, subject to adjustment, at our option either cash or our common shares valued based on such market price for such excess amount.  Holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022, or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events.  
  None of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates. 
  We expect to use cash on hand, the cash flows from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from any property sales and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future debt maturities, property acquisitions and improvements and other general business purposes. 
  When significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach, we currently expect to explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due or renewal or extension of the maturity dates. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt, issuing new equity securities and the sale of properties. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities.  We may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing.  Although we have not historically done so, we may also assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire or obtain mortgage financing on our existing properties. 
  While we believe we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or other types of financings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  Debt Covenants 
  Our debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   consist of outstanding borrowings under our   $1,000,000   revolving credit facility, our   $400,000   term loan and   $2,608,478   of publicly issued term debt and convertible notes. Our publicly issued term debt and convertible notes are governed by two indentures and related supplements. These indentures and related supplements and our credit agreement contain a number of covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, and require us to maintain various financial ratios and our credit agreement restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. Our credit agreement provides for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement.

     Table of Contents  

Neither our indentures and their supplements nor our agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by a change in our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement, our highest senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if that debt rating is downgraded by credit rating agencies, our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility and term loan would increase. 
  Our public debt indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debt of $20,000 or more ($50,000 or more in the case of our indenture and its supplements entered into in February 2016). Similarly, our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $75,000 or more.

These statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for our hotel properties. We consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables and related notes on the following pages to be important measures of our managers  and tenants  success in operating our properties and their ability to continue to pay us.  However, none of this third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance and we have not independently verified the operating data.

Seasonality 
  Our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters.  Most of our management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return and rent payments to us in equal amounts throughout the year.  So long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties, seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flows from these properties.  If and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum rents and returns due to us are exhausted our financial results may begin to reflect more of the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate.  The return payments to us under certain of our management agreements depend exclusively upon earnings at these properties, and, accordingly, our income and cash flows from these properties reflect the seasonality of the hotel industry. 

Related Person Transactions 
  We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with TA, RMR LLC, Sonesta and others related to them. For example, TA is our former subsidiary and our largest tenant and we are TA s largest shareholder.  Also, we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to management agreements; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC and we own shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc.; and the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., ABP Trust, is owned by our Managing Trustees and ABP Trust also owns an equity interest in RMR LLC. In addition, Sonesta is owned by our Managing Trustees and manages certain hotels that we own; and we and six other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services own in equal amounts AIC, an insurance company, and we participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and reinsured in part by AIC. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our   2015   Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our   2016   Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In addition, please see the section captioned  Risk Factors  of our   2015   Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related parties are publicly available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC s website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including TA, RMR LLC, Sonesta and other companies to which RMR LLC or its affiliates provide management services. 
   
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  Funds From Operations Available for Common Shareholders and Normalized Funds From Operations Available for Common Shareholders. 
  We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders as shown below.  FFO available for common shareholders is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which is net income available for common shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us.  Our calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differs from NAREIT s definition of FFO available for common shareholders because we include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will ultimately be payable when all contingencies for determining any such fees are determined at the end of the calendar year and we exclude acquisition related costs and loss on early extinguishment of debt.  We consider FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income available for common shareholders and operating income.  We believe that FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs.  FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to shareholders.  Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common

shareholders do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income available for common shareholders or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity.  These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differently than we do. 
  Our calculations of FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and reconciliations of FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders from net income available for common shareholders, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, appear in the following table (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).  Effective with the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we have changed the calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders to no longer include adjustments for estimated percentage rent. Historically, when calculating Normalized FFO available for common shareholders, we estimated an amount of percentage rental income for each of the first three quarters of the year and then, in the fourth quarter, excluded the amounts that had been included in the first three quarters. In calculating net income in accordance with GAAP, we recognize percentage rental income for the full year in the fourth quarter when all contingencies are met and the income is earned. Normalized FFO available for common shareholders for historical periods has been restated to be comparable with the current period calculation. 

(1) 
    Represents costs associated with our acquisition activities. 
              (2) 
    Estimated incentive fees under our business management agreement calculated based on common share total return, as defined, are included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  In calculating net income in accordance with GAAP, we recognize estimated business management incentive fee expense, if any, each quarter.  Although we recognize this expense, if any, each quarter for purposes of calculating net income, we do not include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders until the fourth quarter, which is when the actual expense amount for the year is determined.  Incentive fees for   2016  , if any, will be paid in cash in January   2017  . 
              (3)

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (dollar amounts in thousands) 
  We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates has not materially changed since   December 31, 2015  . Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
  Fixed Rate Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of seven issues of fixed rate, senior notes and one issue of fixed rate, convertible senior notes: 

(1) 
    The convertible senior notes are convertible, if certain conditions are met (including certain changes in control).  Upon conversion, the holder of notes is entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes and, to the extent the market price of our common shares then exceeds the conversion price of   $49.70   per share, subject to adjustment, at our option either cash or our common shares valued based on such market price for such excess amount.  Holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on March 15, 2017 and March 15, 2022, or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events. 
     Except as described in note 1 to the table above, no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity. Because these notes require interest at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations. If these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are 100 basis points higher than the rates shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately $26,085. Changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Based on the balances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and discounted cash flows analyses through the respective maturity dates, and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would change the fair value of those debt obligations by approximately $129,103. Changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our convertible senior notes. 
  Each of these fixed rate debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date. We are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder. Also, we have in the past repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future. These prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risks of refinancing our debts at their maturities at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity. 
  Floating Rate Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our floating rate debt consisted of   $150,000   outstanding under our   $1,000,000   revolving credit facility and our   $400,000   term loan. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is   July 15, 2018  , and subject to our meeting conditions, including our payment of an extension fee, we have the option to extend the stated maturity by one year to   July 15, 2019  . The maturity date of our term loan is   April 15, 2019  . No principal repayments are required under our revolving credit facility prior to maturity, and we can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available, subject to conditions, at any time without penalty.  No principal prepayments are required under our term loan prior to maturity and repayments may be made subject to conditions at any time without penalty, but after amounts outstanding under our term loan are repaid, amounts may not be redrawn. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are in U.S. dollars and require annual interest at LIBOR plus premiums that are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term interest rates, specifically LIBOR.  In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility or our term loan, we are  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit characteristics. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. 
  The following table presents the impact a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of   September 30, 2016  :   

  (1)  Weighted average based on the interest rates and the respective outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  (2)  Based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents the impact that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at   September 30, 2016   if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and term loan remained outstanding:   

           (1) 
    Weighted average based on the interest rates and the respective outstanding borrowings (assuming fully drawn) as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     The foregoing two tables show the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates. If interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility and term loan or other floating rate debt, if any. Although we have no present plans to do so, we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Managing Trustees, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Managing Trustees, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND UPON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS, NORMALIZED FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS, CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND PROSPECTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: 
             
    THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS ON US AND OUR MANAGERS AND TENANTS, 
                
    COMPETITION WITHIN THE REAL ESTATE, HOTEL, TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVEL CENTER INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY IN THOSE MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED, 
                
    COMPLIANCE WITH, AND CHANGES TO, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE REAL ESTATE, HOTEL, TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVEL CENTER INDUSTRIES, ACCOUNTING RULES, TAX LAWS AND SIMILAR MATTERS, 
                
    LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY COMPLEX RULES IN ORDER FOR US TO QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, 
                
    ACTS OF TERRORISM, OUTBREAKS OF SO CALLED PANDEMICS OR OTHER MANMADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND 
                
    ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING OUR MANAGING TRUSTEES, TA, SONESTA, RMR INC., RMR LLC, AIC AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM. 
     FOR EXAMPLE: 
             
    OUR ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND THE CAPITAL COSTS WE INCUR TO MAINTAIN OUR PROPERTIES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RATE OF DISTRIBUTIONS ON OUR COMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED, 
                
    THE SECURITY DEPOSITS WHICH WE HOLD ARE NOT IN SEGREGATED CASH ACCOUNTS OR OTHERWISE SEPARATE FROM OUR OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACCORDINGLY, WHEN WE RECORD INCOME BY REDUCING OUR SECURITY DEPOSIT LIABILITIES, WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENT. BECAUSE WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENT AS WE APPLY SECURITY DEPOSITS TO COVER PAYMENT SHORTFALLS, THE FAILURE OF OUR MANAGERS OR TENANTS TO PAY MINIMUM RETURNS OR RENTS DUE TO US MAY REDUCE OUR CASH FLOWS AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS, 
                
    AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, APPROXIMATELY   79%   OF OUR AGGREGATE ANNUAL MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS WERE SECURED BY GUARANTEES OR SECURITY DEPOSITS FROM OUR MANAGERS AND TENANTS. THIS MAY IMPLY THAT THESE MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS WILL BE PAID. IN FACT, CERTAIN OF THESE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY DEPOSITS ARE LIMITED IN AMOUNT AND DURATION AND ALL THE GUARANTEES ARE SUBJECT TO THE GUARANTORS  ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY. THE BALANCE OF OUR ANNUAL MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS AS OF   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   WAS NOT GUARANTEED NOR DO WE HOLD A SECURITY DEPOSIT WITH RESPECT TO THOSE AMOUNTS. WE CANNOT BE SURE OF THE FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND WHETHER SUCH PERFORMANCE WILL COVER OUR MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS, WHETHER THE GUARANTEES OR SECURITY DEPOSITS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER FUTURE SHORTFALLS IN THE MINIMUM RETURNS OR RENTS DUE TO US, OR REGARDING OUR MANAGERS , TENANTS  OR GUARANTORS  FUTURE ACTIONS IF AND WHEN THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY DEPOSITS EXPIRE OR ARE DEPLETED OR THEIR ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO PAY MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS OWED TO US,

WE HAVE RECENTLY RENOVATED CERTAIN HOTELS AND ARE CURRENTLY RENOVATING ADDITIONAL HOTELS.  WE EXPECT TO FUND APPROXIMATELY $53.1 MILLION FOR RENOVATIONS AND OTHER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT COSTS AT OUR HOTELS DURING THE 2016 FOURTH QUARTER.  THE COST OF CAPITAL PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RENOVATIONS MAY BE GREATER THAN WE NOW ANTICIPATE. WHILE OUR FUNDING OF THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL CAUSE OUR CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM RETURNS TO INCREASE, THE HOTELS  OPERATING RESULTS MAY NOT INCREASE OR MAY NOT INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE MINIMUM RETURNS INCREASE. ACCORDINGLY, COVERAGE OF OUR MINIMUM RETURNS AT THESE HOTELS MAY REMAIN DEPRESSED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD, 
                
    WE EXPECT TO PURCHASE FROM TA DURING THE 2016 FOURTH QUARTER UP TO $30.0 MILLION OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TA EXPECTS TO MAKE TO THE TRAVEL CENTERS WE LEASE TO TA. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE LEASES, THE ANNUAL RENT PAYABLE TO US BY TA WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH PURCHASES. WE MAY ULTIMATELY PURCHASE MORE OR LESS THAN THIS BUDGETED AMOUNT. TA MAY NOT REALIZE RESULTS FROM ANY OF THESE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH EQUAL OR EXCEED THE INCREASED ANNUAL RENTS IT WILL BE OBLIGATED TO PAY TO US, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF TA BEING UNABLE TO PAY AMOUNTS DUE TO US, 
                
    HOTEL ROOM DEMAND AND TRUCKING ACTIVITY ARE OFTEN REFLECTIONS OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE COUNTRY. IF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE COUNTRY DECLINES, HOTEL ROOM DEMAND AND TRUCKING ACTIVITY MAY DECLINE AND THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR HOTELS AND TRAVEL CENTERS MAY DECLINE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR HOTEL MANAGERS AND OUR TENANTS, INCLUDING TA, MAY SUFFER AND THESE MANAGERS AND TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR RETURNS OR RENTS. ALSO, DEPRESSED OPERATING RESULTS FROM OUR PROPERTIES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS MAY RESULT IN THE OPERATORS OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR HOTELS AND OUR TRAVEL CENTERS BECOMING UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS OR THEIR GUARANTEES AND SECURITY DEPOSITS WE HOLD MAY BE EXHAUSTED, 
                
    IF THE CURRENT LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IN THE COUNTRY DECLINES, IF THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY, IF FUEL CONSERVATION MEASURES ARE INCREASED, IF FREIGHT BUSINESS IS DIRECTED AWAY FROM TRUCKING, IF TA IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE OR OPERATE ITS BUSINESS OR FOR VARIOUS OTHER REASONS, TA MAY BECOME UNABLE TO PAY CURRENT AND DEFERRED RENTS DUE TO US, 
                
    OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND INCREASE OUR DISTRIBUTIONS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO BUY PROPERTIES THAT GENERATE RETURNS OR CAN BE LEASED FOR RENTS WHICH EXCEED OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES THAT WE WANT TO ACQUIRE OR TO NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE PURCHASE PRICES, ACQUISITION FINANCING, MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS OR LEASE TERMS FOR NEW PROPERTIES, 
                
    WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE FROM AND LEASE BACK TO TA A TRAVEL CENTER WHICH TA IS DEVELOPING. WE AGREED TO PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY AT TA S COST (INCLUDING HISTORICAL LAND COST) UP TO $29 MILLION IF THE DEVELOPMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED PRIOR TO JUNE 30, 2017.  TA HAS BEGUN CONSTRUCTION AT THIS TRAVEL CENTER. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST AND TIMING TO DEVELOP A NEW TRAVEL CENTER. CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW TRAVEL CENTER MAY BE DELAYED FOR VARIOUS REASONS SUCH AS LABOR STRIFE, WEATHER CONDITIONS, THE UNAVAILABILITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, ETC. THE PURCHASE AND LEASE BACK OF THIS TRAVEL CENTER MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION MAY CHANGE, 
                
    CONTINGENCIES IN OUR ACQUISITION AND SALE AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND SALES AND ANY RELATED MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WE MAY EXPECT TO ENTER INTO MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS MAY CHANGE, 
                
    AT   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  , WE HAD   $9.5   MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $850.0 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER OUR   $1.0   BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND SECURITY DEPOSITS AND GUARANTEES COVERING SOME OF OUR MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS. THESE STATEMENTS

MAY IMPLY THAT WE HAVE ABUNDANT WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, OUR MANAGERS AND TENANTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FUND MINIMUM RETURNS AND RENTS DUE TO US FROM OPERATING OUR PROPERTIES OR FROM OTHER RESOURCES; IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY, CERTAIN OF OUR TENANTS AND HOTEL MANAGERS HAVE IN FACT NOT PAID THE MINIMUM AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM THEIR OPERATIONS OF OUR LEASED OR MANAGED PROPERTIES. ALSO, CERTAIN OF THE SECURITY DEPOSITS AND GUARANTEES WE HAVE TO COVER ANY SUCH SHORTFALLS ARE LIMITED IN AMOUNT AND DURATION, AND ANY SECURITY DEPOSITS WE APPLY FOR SUCH SHORTFALLS DO NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CASH FLOWS TO US. FURTHER, OUR PROPERTIES REQUIRE, AND WE HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE, SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, RENOVATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL OR LIQUIDITY, 
             
    WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REPAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME DUE, 
                
    CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO OUR SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CREDIT FACILITY CONDITIONS THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SATISFY, 
                
    ACTUAL COSTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR OTHER FLOATING RATE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE HIGHER THAN LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM BECAUSE OF OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FACILITIES, 
                
    THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO   $2.3   BILLION ON A COMBINED BASIS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, INCREASING THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO OUR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM LENDERS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR, 
                
    THE PREMIUMS USED TO DETERMINE THE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN AND THE FACILITY FEE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS.  FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY CAUSE THE INTEREST AND FEES WE PAY TO INCREASE, 
                
    WE HAVE THE OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UPON PAYMENT OF A FEE AND MEETING OTHER CONDITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE APPLICABLE CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE MET, 
                
    THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND RMR LLC HAVE CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS.  HOWEVER, THOSE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE TERMS WHICH PERMIT EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS OR FOR SHORTER TERMS, 
                
    WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING RMR LLC, RMR INC., TA, SONESTA, AIC AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM MAY BENEFIT US AND PROVIDE US WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN OPERATING AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THE ADVANTAGES WE BELIEVE WE MAY REALIZE FROM THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE, AND 
                
    MARRIOTT HAS NOTIFIED US THAT IT DOES NOT INTEND TO EXTEND ITS LEASE FOR OUR RESORT HOTEL ON KAUAI, HAWAII WHEN THAT LEASE EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND WE INTEND TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH MARRIOTT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS HOTEL.  THESE STATEMENTS MAY IMPLY THAT MARRIOTT WILL NOT OPERATE THIS HOTEL IN THE FUTURE OR THAT WE MAY RECEIVE LESS CASH FLOW FROM THIS HOTEL IN THE FUTURE.  OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH MARRIOTT HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN.  AT THIS TIME WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH MARRIOTT WILL IMPACT THE FUTURE OF THIS HOTEL.  FOR EXAMPLE, THIS HOTEL MAY CONTINUE TO BE OPERATED BY MARRIOTT ON DIFFERENT CONTRACT TERMS THAN THE CURRENT LEASE, WE MAY IDENTIFY A DIFFERENT OPERATOR FOR THIS HOTEL, OR THE CASH FLOW WHICH WE RECEIVE FROM OUR OWNERSHIP OF THIS HOTEL MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE RENT WE NOW RECEIVE.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and the terms and conditions of the Hospitality Properties Trust 2012 Equity Compensation Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ), the Company hereby grants to the Recipient, effective as of the date of this Agreement,  NUMBER  of its common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the  Common Shares ).  The shares so granted are hereinafter referred to as the  Shares,  which term shall also include any shares of the Company issued to the Recipient by virtue of his or her ownership of the Shares, by share dividend, share split or combination, recapitalization or otherwise. 
  2.      Vesting; Repurchase of Shares  .

Any Shares not vested as of any date are herein referred to as  Unvested Shares.  
  (b)    Subject to Section 2(c) hereof, at the option of the Company, in the event the Recipient ceases to render significant services, whether as an employee or otherwise, to (i) the Company, (ii) the entity which is the manager or shared services provider to the Company or an entity controlled by, under common control with or controlling such entity (collectively, the  Manager ), or (iii) an affiliate of the Company (which shall be deemed for such purpose to include any other entity to which the Manager is the manager or shared services provider), all or any portion of the Unvested Shares shall be forfeited by the Recipient as of the date the Recipient ceases to render all such services.  The Company may exercise such option by delivering or mailing to the Recipient (or his or her estate), at any time after the Recipient has ceased to render such services, a written notice of exercise of such option.  Such notice shall specify the number of Unvested Shares to be forfeited. 
  (c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined below), all of the Unvested Shares shall vest and any forfeiture or other rights of the Company described in Section 2(b) shall lapse in their entirety, and such vesting and lapse of forfeiture or other Company rights shall also immediately apply to each other Common Share previously granted to the Recipient which then remains subject to comparable restrictions and rights.
