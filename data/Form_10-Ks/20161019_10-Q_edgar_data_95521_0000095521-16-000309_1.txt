SUPERVALU INC. and Subsidiaries 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data) 

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  Statement of Registrant 
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of SUPERVALU INC. (the  Company ,  SUPERVALU ,  we ,  us  or  our ) for the   second   quarters and year-to-date periods ended   September 10, 2016   and   September 12, 2015   are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature necessary to present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for such periods. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . The results of operations for the   second   quarter and fiscal year-to-date ended   September 10, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 
  Accounting Policies 
  The summary of significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . 
  Fiscal Year 
  The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with its fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in February. References to the   second   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016   relate to the 12 week fiscal quarters ended   September 10, 2016   and   September 12, 2015  , respectively. References to fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date relate to the 28 week fiscal periods ended   September 10, 2016   and   September 12, 2015  , respectively. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company s banking arrangements allow the Company to fund outstanding checks when presented to the financial institution for payment. The Company funds all intraday bank balance overdrafts during the same business day. Checks outstanding in excess of bank balances create net book overdrafts, which are recorded in Accounts payable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as an operating activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  , the Company had net book overdrafts of   $132   and   $131  , respectively. 
  Inventories, Net 
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all of the Company s inventories consist of finished goods and a substantial portion of the Company s inventories have a last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) reserve applied. Interim LIFO calculations are based on the Company s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs, as the actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is computed at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. If the first-in, first-out method had been used, Inventories, net would have been higher by approximately   $217   at   September 10, 2016   and   $215   at   February 27, 2016  . The Company recorded a LIFO charge of   $0   and   $2   for the   second   quarters ended   September 10, 2016   and   September 12, 2015  , respectively. The Company recorded a LIFO charge of   $2   and   $5   for fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued authoritative guidance under Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 320): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   ASU 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows. The Company is required to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking  expected loss  model that will replace today s  incurred loss  model and generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except that the losses will be recognized as an allowance. The Company is required to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . ASU 2016-09 provides for simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is required to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 provides new comprehensive lease accounting guidance that supersedes existing lease guidance. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company will be required to recognize most leases on its balance sheet at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented with a corresponding adjustment to stockholders' equity. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to capitalize most current operating lease obligations as right-of-use assets based on the present value of future operating lease payments and to recognize a corresponding liability. Criteria for distinguishing leases between finance and operating are substantially similar to criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in existing lease guidance. The Company is required to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . ASU 2016-01 revises the classification, measurement and disclosure of investments in equity securities. The Company is required to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . ASU 2014-09 supersedes existing revenue recognition requirements and provides a new comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance will likely be adopted by the Company during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  . The adoption will include updates as provided under ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net);   ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing;   and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   Adoption is allowed by either the full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating which approach it will apply and the potential impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 
  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company paid   $17   to acquire   22   Food Lion stores located in northern West Virginia, western Maryland, south central Pennsylvania and northwestern Virginia. The acquisition included certain store assets, including inventories, property, plant, and equipment, and capital and operating leases. The acquired stores were converted to the Company's Shop  N Save format that is currently used by some of the Company's Wholesale customers in that region and will at least initially be operated by the Company's Retail segment. The Company is in discussions with certain of its wholesale customers and the Federal Trade Commission on potential structures that would allow these wholesale customers to have an interest in these stores at some future date.

Diesel Fuel Derivatives 
  Fuel derivative gains (losses) are included within Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and were   $(0)   and   $(1)   for the   second   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , and   $0   and   $(2)   for fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, respectively. 
  Interest Rate Swap Derivatives 
  Interest rate swap derivative reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings are recorded within Interest expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and were   $0   and   $0   in the   second   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , and   $1   and   $0   for fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, respectively. No amounts were reclassified related to hedging ineffectiveness. 
  As of   September 10, 2016  , a 100 basis point increase in forward LIBOR interest rates would increase the fair value of the interest rate swap by approximately   $5   and a 100 basis point decrease in forward LIBOR interest rates would decrease the fair value of the interest rate swap by approximately   $2  . 
  Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment discussed in   Note 4 Reserves for Closed Properties and Property, Plant and Equipment-related Impairment Charges   were also measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs.

Fair Value Estimates 
  For certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued salaries and other current assets and liabilities, the fair values approximate carrying amounts due to their short maturities. 
  The estimated fair value of notes receivable was greater than their carrying amount by approximately   $1   and   $1   as of   September 10, 2016     and     February 27, 2016  , respectively. Notes receivable are valued based on a discounted cash flow approach applying     a market rate for similar instruments that is determined using Level 3 inputs. 
  The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt was less than the carrying amount, excluding debt financing costs, by approximately   $54   and   $236   as of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  , respectively. The estimated fair value was based on market quotes, where available, or market values for similar instruments, using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. 

NOTE 6 LONG-TERM DEBT    
  The Company s long-term debt consisted of the following: 

The Company s credit facilities and certain long-term debt agreements have restrictive covenants and cross-default provisions, which generally provide, subject to the Company s right to cure, for the acceleration of payments due in the event of a breach of a covenant or a default in the payment of a specified amount of indebtedness due under certain other debt agreements. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented. 
  Senior Secured Credit Agreements 
  As of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $1,356   and   $1,459  , respectively, under its   $1,500   term loan facility (the  Secured Term Loan Facility ), which is secured by substantially all of the Company s real estate, equipment and certain other assets, and bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus   4.50 percent   subject to a floor on LIBOR of   1.00 percent  . The Secured Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by the Company s material subsidiaries (together with the Company, the  Term Loan Parties ). To secure their obligations under the Secured Term Loan Facility, the Company granted a perfected first-priority security interest for the benefit of the facility lenders in the Term Loan Parties  equity interests in Moran Foods, LLC, the main operating entity of the Company s Save-A-Lot business, and the Term Loan Parties granted a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all of their intellectual property and a first-priority mortgage lien and security interest in certain owned or ground-leased real estate and associated equipment pledged as collateral. As of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  , there was   $789   and   $781  , respectively, of owned or ground-leased real estate and associated equipment pledged as collateral, which was included in Property, plant and equipment, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Secured Term Loan Facility are secured by second-priority security interests in the collateral securing the Company s   $1,000   asset-based revolving ABL credit facility (the  Revolving ABL Credit Facility ). As of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  ,   $0   and   $102   of the Secured Term Loan Facility was classified as current. 
    
  On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Secured Term Loan Facility (the  Third Term Loan Amendment ) that permits the Company and its subsidiaries to undertake certain transactions reasonably determined by the Company to be necessary to effectuate a separation of Save-A-Lot ( SpinCo ) and the distribution to the Company s stockholders of a portion of the shares of common stock of SpinCo (the  Distribution ) and to dispose of the interest in SpinCo that the Company retains in the Distribution, subject to certain conditions. Among other things, the term loan lenders  consent to the Distribution is conditioned upon SpinCo, Moran Foods, LLC or one or more of their respective subsidiaries incurring

     Table of Contents  

indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of at least   $400  , the Company prepaying at least   $350   in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Secured Term Loan Facility, and the amount of equity interests of SpinCo distributed in the Distribution being no greater than the minimum amount (as reasonably determined by the Company in good faith) required to satisfy the requirements of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In accordance with the terms of the Third Term Loan Amendment, the net cash proceeds of any future disposition of the equity interests in SpinCo that the Company retains in the Distribution could be required to be used to prepay borrowings under the Secured Term Loan Facility. The Third Term Loan Amendment also increased the interest rate for the term loan from LIBOR plus   3.50 percent   to LIBOR plus   4.50 percent   with the floor on LIBOR remaining at   1.00 percent  , subject to a further increase of   0.25 percent   if certain rating conditions are not satisfied. During fiscal 2017 year-to-date, in connection with the completion of the Third Term Loan Amendment, the Company paid debt financing costs of approximately   $5  , of which   $4   was capitalized and   $1   was expensed in Interest expense, net, and recognized non-cash charges of approximately   $3   in Interest expense, net for the write-off of existing unamortized debt financing costs and   $1   for the accelerated amortization of original issue discount. 
  The loans under the Secured Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in certain minimum principal amounts, subject to the payment of breakage or similar costs. Pursuant to the Secured Term Loan Facility, the Company must, subject to certain customary reinvestment rights, apply   100 percent   of Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the facility) from certain types of asset sales (excluding proceeds of the collateral security of the Revolving ABL Credit Facility and other secured indebtedness) to prepay the loans outstanding under the Secured Term Loan Facility. The Company must also prepay loans outstanding under the facility no later than   90   days after the fiscal year end in an aggregate principal amount equal to a percentage (which percentage ranges from   0   to   50 percent   depending on the Company s Total Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the facility) as of the last day of such fiscal year) of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the facility) for the fiscal year then ended minus any voluntary prepayments made during such fiscal year with Internally Generated Cash (as defined in the facility). Based on the Company's Excess Cash Flow in fiscal 2016, a   $99   prepayment was required and paid in the first quarter ended June 18, 2016. The potential amount of prepayment from Excess Cash Flow that may be required for fiscal 2017 is not reasonably estimable as of   September 10, 2016  . 
  In connection with the sale of the Company's Save-A-Lot business, within   ten   days of such transaction the Company must prepay loans outstanding under the Secured Term Loan Facility with   100%   of the first   $750   of Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the facility) received and with   50%   of the Net Cash Proceeds in excess of   $750   up to an aggregate amount that would cause the Total Secured Leverage Ratio, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such prepayment to be no higher than   1.50  :1.00. In connection with such a mandatory prepayment, the Company would recognize non-cash charges to Interest expense, net for the write-off of existing unamortized debt financing costs and accelerated amortization of original issue discount based on the aggregate amount of the loan prepayment. Additionally, the security interests in the equity interests of Moran Foods, LLC and the Save-A-Lot assets would be released under the Secured Term Loan Facility and the Revolving ABL Credit Facility. 
  As of   September 10, 2016   and   February 27, 2016  , there were   $100   and   $138  , respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility. As of   September 10, 2016  , letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility were   $65   at fees of   1.375 percent  , and the unused available credit under this facility was   $828   with facility fees of   0.25 percent  . As of   February 27, 2016  , letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility were   $69   at fees of   1.625 percent  , and the unused available credit under this facility was   $744   with facility fees of   0.25 percent  . As of   September 10, 2016  , the Revolving ABL Credit Facility was secured on a first-priority basis by   $1,279   of certain inventory assets included in Inventories, net,   $243   of certain receivables included in Receivables, net,   $30   of certain amounts included in Cash and cash equivalents and all of the Company s pharmacy scripts included in Intangible assets, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of   February 27, 2016  , the Revolving ABL Credit Facility was secured on a first-priority basis by   $1,238   of certain inventory assets included in Inventories, net,   $222   of certain receivables included in Receivables, net,   $23   of certain amounts included in Cash and cash equivalents and all of the Company's pharmacy scripts included in Intangible assets, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The revolving loans under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in certain minimum principal amounts, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs. The Company and those subsidiaries named as borrowers under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility are required to repay the revolving loans in cash and provide cash collateral under this facility to the extent that the revolving loans and letters of credit exceed the lesser of the borrowing base then in effect or the aggregate amount of the lenders  commitments under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility. During fiscal 2017 year-to-date, the Company borrowed   $1,669   and repaid   $1,707   under its Revolving ABL Credit Facility. During fiscal 2016 year-to-date, the Company borrowed   $234   and repaid   $234   under its Revolving ABL Credit Facility. Certain of the Company s material subsidiaries are co-borrowers under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility, and this facility is guaranteed by the rest of the Company s material subsidiaries (the Company and those subsidiaries named as borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility, the  ABL Loan Parties ). To secure their obligations under this facility, the ABL Loan Parties have granted a perfected first-priority security interest for the benefit of the facility lenders in their present and future inventory, credit card, wholesale trade, pharmacy and certain other receivables, prescription files and related

assets. In addition, the obligations under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility are secured by second-priority liens on and security interests in the collateral securing the Secured Term Loan Facility, subject to certain limitations to ensure compliance with the Company s outstanding debt instruments and leases. 
  Both the Secured Term Loan Facility and the Revolving ABL Credit Facility limit the Company s ability to make Restricted Payments (as defined in both the Secured Term Loan Facility and the Revolving ABL Credit Facility), which include dividends to stockholders. The Secured Term Loan Facility caps the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments that may be made over the life of the Secured Term Loan Facility. That aggregate cap can fluctuate over time and the cap could be reduced by certain other actions taken by the Company, including certain debt prepayments and Permitted Investments (as defined in the Secured Term Loan Facility). As of   September 10, 2016  , the aggregate cap on Restricted Payments was approximately   $398  . The Revolving ABL Credit Facility permits dividends up to   $75   per fiscal year, not to exceed   $175   in the aggregate over the life of the Revolving ABL Credit Facility as long as no Cash Dominion Event (as defined in the Revolving ABL Credit Facility) exists. Those caps could be reduced by certain debt prepayments made by the Company. The Revolving ABL Credit Facility permits other Restricted Payments as long as the Payment Conditions (as defined in the Revolving ABL Credit Facility) are met. 
  Debentures 
  The   $400   of   6.75 percent   Senior Notes due June 2021 and the   $350   of   7.75 percent   Senior Notes due November 2022 contain operating covenants, including limitations on liens and on sale and leaseback transactions. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented. 

NOTE 7 INCOME TAXES

NOTE 8 STOCK-BASED AWARDS    
  The Company recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense (included primarily in Selling and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations) related to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and performance share units (collectively referred to as  stock-based awards ) of   $6  ,   $6  ,   $10   and   $13   for the   second   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , and for fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, respectively. 
  Stock Options 
  In April   2016   and April   2015  , the Company granted   1   and   4   non-qualified stock options, respectively, to certain employees under the Company s 2012 Stock Plan with weighted average grant date fair values of   $2.67   per share and   $3.67   per share, respectively. The stock options vest over a period of   three   years and were awarded as part of a broad-based employee incentive program designed to retain and motivate employees across the Company. 
  The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based upon the following assumptions:

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
  In fiscal   2017   year-to-date, the Company granted   4   restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain employees under the 2012 Stock Plan. The RSUs vest over a   three   year period from the date of the grant and were granted at a fair value of   $5.64   per award. In fiscal   2016   year-to-date, the Company granted   2   restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) to certain employees under the 2012 Stock Plan. The RSAs vest over a   three   year period from the date of grant and were granted at a fair value of   $8.79   per unit. 
  Performance Share Units 
  In fiscal   2017   year-to-date, the Company granted   1   performance share units ( PSUs ) to certain employees under the 2012 Stock Plan.  The PSUs have a fiscal 2017-2019 performance period and settle in shares of the Company s stock. The Company used the Monte Carlo method to estimate the fair value of the PSUs at grant date based upon the following assumptions: 

NOTE 9 BENEFIT PLANS    
  Net periodic benefit expense (income) and contributions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans consisted of the following:

     Table of Contents  

Multiemployer Pension Plans 
  During fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, the Company contributed   $21   and   $20  , respectively, to various multiemployer pension plans, primarily defined benefit pension plans, under collective bargaining agreements. 
  Pension Contributions 
  No minimum contributions are required to the Company's pension plans in fiscal   2017   in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ). The Company anticipates fiscal   2017   discretionary pension contributions and required minimum other postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately   $30   to   $35  . 
  Lump Sum Pension Settlements 
  Subsequent to the second quarter ended September 10, 2016, the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan, the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company, made an offering to certain deferred vested pension plan participants to settle pension obligations under a lump sum payment option window. The payments would be equal to the present value of the pension benefits of a participant who has not yet begun receiving monthly pension benefits payments under the SUPERVALU INC. Retirement Plan. The lump sum settlement payments are expected to result in a non-cash pension settlement charge of   $55   to   $65   from the acceleration of a portion of the accumulated unrecognized actuarial loss.  

NOTE 10 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE    
  Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings attributable to SUPERVALU INC. divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is computed after giving effect to the dilutive impacts of stock-based awards. 
  The following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net earnings per share:   

  Stock-based awa  rds of     15     and     10     that were outstanding during the     second     quarters of fiscal     2017     and     2016  , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods because their inclusion would be antidilutive. Stock-based awards of     16     and     6     were outstanding during fiscal     2017     and     2016     year-to-date,

respectively, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods because their inclusion would be antidilutive. 

NOTE 11 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS    
  The Company reports comprehensive income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders  deficit during the reporting period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders. The Company s comprehensive income is calculated as net earnings (loss) including noncontrolling interests, plus or minus adjustments for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, net of tax, and changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, net of tax, less comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss represents the cumulative balance of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as of the end of the reporting period and relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation adjustments, net of tax, and unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax.  
  Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for fiscal   2017   year-to-date are as follows:

These guarantees were generally made to support the business growth of wholesale customers. The guarantees are generally for the entire terms of the leases or other debt obligations with remaining terms that range from less than   one   year to   15   years, with a weighted average remaining term of approximately   nine   years. For each guarantee issued, if the wholesale customer or other third party defaults on a payment, the Company would be required to make payments under its guarantee. Generally, the guarantees are secured by indemnification agreements or personal guarantees of the wholesale customer. 
  The Company reviews performance risk related to its guarantee obligations based on internal measures of credit performance. As of   September 10, 2016  , the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the Company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was   $62   and represented   $47   on a discounted basis. Based on the indemnification agreements, personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk, the Company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. Accordingly, no amount has been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these contingent obligations under the Company s guarantee arrangements. 
  The Company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. The Company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of the Company s lease assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available, the Company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote.

The Company is a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters in the ordinary course of business, which indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise. These agreements primarily relate to the Company s commercial contracts, service agreements, contracts entered into for the purchase and sale of stock or assets, operating leases and other real estate contracts, financial agreements, agreements to provide services to the Company and agreements to indemnify officers, directors and employees in the performance of their work. While the Company s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, the Company is not aware of any matters that are expected to result in a material liability. 
  Following the sale of New Albertson's Inc. ("NAI") on March 21, 2013, the Company remains contingently liable with respect to certain self-insurance commitments and other guarantees as a result of parental guarantees issued by SUPERVALU with respect to the obligations of NAI that were incurred while NAI was a subsidiary of the Company. As of   September 10, 2016  , using actuarial estimates as of June 30, 2016, the total undiscounted amount of all such guarantees was estimated at   $138   (  $123   on a discounted basis). Based on the expected settlement of the self-insurance claims that underlie the Company s commitments, the Company believes that such contingent liabilities will continue to decline. Subsequent to the sale of NAI, NAI collateralized most of these obligations with letters of credit and surety bonds to numerous states. Because NAI remains a primary obligor on these self-insurance and other obligations and has collateralized most of the self-insurance obligations for which the Company remains contingently liable, the Company believes that the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. Accordingly, no amount has been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for these guarantees. 
  Agreements with AB Acquisition LLC and Affiliates 
  In connection with the sale of NAI, the Company entered into various agreements with AB Acquisition LLC and its affiliates related to on-going operations, including a Transition Services Agreement with each of NAI and Albertson s LLC (collectively, the  TSA ) and operating and supply agreements. At the time of the sale of NAI, these arrangements had initial terms ranging from   12 months   to   five years  , and are generally subject to renewal upon mutual agreement by the parties thereto and also include termination provisions that can be exercised by each party. On September 6, 2016, NAI and Albertson s LLC each notified the Company that it was again exercising its right to renew the term of their respective Transition Services Agreement for an additional year. Pursuant to this notice, each TSA will now expire on September 21, 2018 unless renewed again by notice given no later than September 21, 2017. In addition, the Company operates a distribution center owned by NAI.  
  On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which the Company is providing services to NAI and Albertson s LLC as needed to transition and wind down the TSA. In exchange for these transition and wind down services, the Company is entitled to receive   eight   payments of approximately   $6   every six months for aggregate fees of   $50  . These payments are separate from and incremental to the fixed and variable fees the Company receives under the TSA. The Company estimates that the complete transition and wind down of the TSA could take approximately   two   to   three   more years.  
  On May 28, 2015, the Company entered into a letter agreement with NAI and Albertson's LLC pursuant to which the Company received certain additional rights and benefits, and the Company and NAI and Albertson's LLC (and certain of their affiliates, including Safeway, with respect to provisions of the letter agreement applicable to them) agreed to resolve several issues. Among other matters resolved, NAI, Albertson's LLC and AB Acquisition agreed to no longer challenge, and waive all rights relating to, the Company's filing with the IRS in fiscal 2015 for a change in accounting method for NAI and its subsidiaries pursuant to the tangible property repair regulations. In consideration for the granting of the additional rights and benefits to the Company and the resolution of the various matters under the letter agreement, the Company paid   $35   to AB Acquisition, the parent entity of NAI and Albertson's LLC.  
  Haggen 
  The Company entered into a transition services agreement with Haggen in December 2014 (the  Haggen TSA ) to provide certain services to   164   stores owned and being acquired by Haggen in five states. The Company also entered into a supply agreement with Haggen to supply goods and products to Haggen stores in Washington and Oregon.  On September 8, 2015, Haggen filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Through the bankruptcy process, Haggen has now closed or sold all   164   stores. The transition and wind down of the Haggen TSA and supply agreement occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with the Company now providing limited services in connection with the wind down of the Haggen estate. The Company filed approximately   $2   of administrative 503(b)(9) priority claims and approximately   $8   of unsecured claims with the bankruptcy court, including a number of contingent claims. On September 30, 2016, the bankruptcy court approved settlement agreements resolving the Company s unsecured claims against Haggen. In accordance with the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company received approximately   $3   from Haggen on October 11, 2016, and it anticipates Haggen will make further payments of approximately   $2   on account of the Company s claims. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Haggen has agreed not to pursue claw-backs of any transfers made to the Company. The Company could  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

be exposed to claims from third parties from which the Company sourced products, services, licenses and similar benefits on behalf of Haggen.  The Company has reserved for probable losses related to a portion of these claims and receivables.  It is reasonably possible that the Company could experience losses in excess of the amount of such reserves; however, at this time the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of such excess losses because of the factual and legal issues related to whether the Company would have liability for any such third-party claims, if such third-party claims were asserted against the Company. 
  Information Technology Intrusions 
  Computer Network Intrusions     In fiscal 2015, the Company announced it had experienced   two   separate criminal intrusions into the portion of its computer network that processes payment card transactions for some of its owned and franchised retail stores, including some of its associated stand-alone liquor stores. An investigation of those intrusions supported by third-party data forensics experts is ongoing. Given the continuing nature of the investigation, it is possible that it will be determined that information was stolen from the Company during one or both of these intrusions, or that new or different time frames, locations, at-risk data, and/or other facts will be identified in the future. 
  Some stores owned and operated by Albertson's LLC and NAI experienced related criminal intrusions. The Company provides information technology services to these Albertson's LLC and NAI stores pursuant to the TSA, and the Company has been working together with Albertson's LLC and NAI to respond to the intrusions into their stores. The Company believes that any losses incurred by Albertson's LLC or NAI as a result of the intrusions affecting their stores would not be the Company's responsibility. 
  Investigations and Proceedings     As a result of the criminal intrusions, the payment card brands are conducting investigations and, although the Company s network has previously been found to be compliant with applicable data security standards, the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card brands has concluded that the Company was not in compliance at the time of the intrusions and that the alleged non-compliance caused at least some portion of the compromise of payment card data that allegedly occurred during the intrusions. On August 1, 2016, MasterCard provided notice of its assessment of non-ordinary course expenses and incremental counterfeit fraud losses allegedly incurred by them or their issuers as a result of the criminal intrusions. On September 1, 2016, the Company submitted an appeal of the assessment to MasterCard and, while the Company continues to believe that the assessment is without merit, the Company believes that a settlement with MasterCard is probable.  The Company expects the other payment card brands to also allege that the Company was not compliant with the applicable data security standards at the time of the intrusions and that such alleged non-compliance caused the compromise of payment card data during the intrusions. The Company believes these payment card brands will also make claims against the Company for non-ordinary course operating expenses and incremental counterfeit fraud losses allegedly incurred by them or their issuers by reason of the intrusions and the Company expects to dispute those claims. While the Company does not believe that a loss is probable by reason of these as yet unasserted claims, the Company believes that a loss in connection with these claims, should they be asserted, is reasonably possible; however, at this time the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses because the payment card brands  investigation is ongoing and the payment card brands have not alleged what payment cards they consider to have been compromised, what data from those cards they consider to have been compromised, or the amount of their and/or their issuers' claimed losses. The Company does not currently believe that the amount accrued for settlement of the MasterCard assessment and any amount that may be paid for other payment card brand claims that might be asserted will be material to the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, one payment card brand has placed the Company in a  probationary status  for a period of   two   years following the Company's re-validation as PCI-DSS compliant, during which time the Company's failure to comply with the probationary requirements set forth by the payment card brand could result in the imposition of further conditions, including but not limited to disqualification from the payment system. The Company does not anticipate material costs to comply with the probationary requirements.  
  On October 23, 2015, the Company received a letter from a multistate group of Attorneys General seeking information regarding the intrusions. The Company is cooperating with the request. To date, no claims have been asserted against the Company related to this inquiry. If any claims are asserted, the Company expects to dispute those claims. 
  As discussed in more detail below in this Note 12 under   Legal Proceedings  ,   four   class action complaints related to the intrusions have been filed against the Company and consolidated into   one   action and are currently pending. As indicated below, the Company believes that the likelihood of a material loss from the four class actions is remote. It is possible that other similar complaints by consumers, banks or others may be filed against the Company in connection with the intrusions. 
  Insurance Coverage and Expenses     The Company had   $50   of cyber threat insurance above a per incident deductible of   $1   at the time of the intrusions, which it believes should mitigate the financial effect of these intrusions, including claims made or  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

that might be made against the Company based on these intrusions. The Company now maintains   $90   of cyber threat insurance above a per incident deductible of approximately   $3  , in each case subject to certain sublimits. 
  Other Contractual Commitments 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into supply contracts to purchase products for resale and purchase and service contracts for fixed asset and information technology commitments. These contracts typically include either volume commitments or fixed expiration dates, termination provisions and other standard contractual considerations. As of   September 10, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $330   of non-cancelable future purchase obligations. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is subject to various lawsuits, claims and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business. In the opinion of management, based upon currently available facts, the likelihood that the ultimate outcome of any lawsuits, claims and other proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the Company s operations, its cash flows or its financial position is remote. 
  In September 2008, a class action complaint was filed against the Company, as well as International Outsourcing Services, LLC ( IOS  Inmar, Inc.; Carolina Manufacturer s Services, Inc.; Carolina Coupon Clearing, Inc. and Carolina Services in the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs in the case are a consumer goods manufacturer, a grocery co-operative and a retailer marketing services company that allege on behalf of a purported class that the Company and the other defendants (i) conspired to restrict the markets for coupon processing services under the Sherman Act and (ii) were part of an illegal enterprise to defraud the plaintiffs under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages, attorneys  fees and injunctive relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit; however, all proceedings have been stayed in the case pending the result of the criminal prosecution of certain former officers of IOS. 
  In December 2008, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin against the Company alleging that a 2003 transaction between the Company and C S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. ( C S ) was a conspiracy to restrain trade and allocate markets. In the 2003 transaction, the Company purchased certain assets of the Fleming Corporation as part of Fleming Corporation s bankruptcy proceedings and sold certain assets of the Company to C S that were located in New England.   Three   other retailers filed similar complaints in other jurisdictions and the cases were consolidated and are proceeding in the United States District Court in Minnesota. The complaints allege that the conspiracy was concealed and continued through the use of non-compete and non-solicitation agreements and the closing down of the distribution facilities that the Company and C S purchased from each other. Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys  fees. On July 5, 2011, the District Court granted the Company s Motion to Compel Arbitration for those plaintiffs with arbitration agreements and plaintiffs appealed. On July 16, 2012, the District Court denied plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification and on January 11, 2013, the District Court granted the Company s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed the case regarding the non-arbitration plaintiffs. On February 12, 2013, the 8th Circuit reversed the District Court decision requiring plaintiffs with arbitration agreements to arbitrate and remanded to the District Court. On October 30, 2013, the parties attended a District Court ordered mandatory mediation, which was not successful in resolving the matter. On May 21, 2014, a panel of the 8th Circuit (1) reversed the District Court s decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Company, and (2) affirmed the District Court s decision denying class certification of a class consisting of all retailers located in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin that purchased wholesale grocery products from the Company between December 31, 2004 and September 13, 2008, but remanded the case for the District Court to consider whether to certify a narrower class of purchasers supplied from the Company s Champaign, Illinois distribution center and potentially other distribution centers. On June 19, 2015, the District Court Magistrate Judge entered an order that decided a number of matters including granting plaintiffs' request to seek class certification for certain Midwest Distribution Centers and denying plaintiffs' request to add an additional New England plaintiff and denying plaintiffs  request to seek class certification for a group of New England retailers. On August 20, 2015, the District Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge s order.  In September 2015, the plaintiffs appealed to the 8th Circuit the denial of the request to add an additional New England plaintiff and to seek class certification for a group of New England retailers and the hearing before the 8th Circuit occurred on May 17, 2016. On March 1, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a class certification motion seeking to certify   five   District Court classes of retailers in the Midwest and the Company filed its response on May 6, 2016. On September 7, 2016, the District Court granted plaintiffs  motion to certify   five   Midwest distribution center classes, only   one   of which is suing the Company (the non-arbitration Champaign distribution center class).  On September 21, 2016, the Company filed a petition with the 8th Circuit seeking permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the class certification decision.  The District Court has ordered a mandatory settlement conference for February 14-15, 2017.   The Company continues to vigorously defend this lawsuit.  Due to the mandatory settlement conference, it is reasonably possible that the parties will engage in settlement negotiations as required by the District Court, which may result in a settlement of the matter.  However, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter due to the procedural status of the case, the lack of a formal demand on the Company by the plaintiffs and plaintiffs  failure to allege any specific, evidence-based damages.  
  In August and November 2014,   four   class action complaints were filed against the Company relating to the criminal intrusions into its computer network announced by the Company in fiscal 2015 (the  Criminal Intrusion ). The cases were centralized in the Federal District Court for the District of Minnesota under the caption   In Re: SUPERVALU Inc. Customer Data Security Breach Litigation  . On June 26, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint and the hearing took place on November 3, 2015. On January 7, 2016, the District Court granted the Motion to Dismiss and dismissed the case without prejudice, holding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue as they had not met their burden of showing any compensable damages. On February 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the District Court's dismissal of the complaint or in the alternative to conduct discovery and file an amended complaint, and the Company filed its response in opposition on March 4, 2016. On April 20, 2016, the District Court denied plaintiffs' motion to vacate the District Court's dismissal or in the alternative to amend the complaint.  On May 18, 2016, plaintiffs appealed to the 8th Circuit and on May 31, 2016, the Company filed a cross-appeal to preserve its additional arguments for dismissal of the plaintiffs' complaint. To date, no hearing date has been set for the 8th Circuit argument. 
  On June 30, 2015, the Company received a letter from the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( OCR ) seeking documents and information regarding the Company s HIPAA breach notification and reporting from 2009 to the present.  The letter indicates that the OCR Midwest Region is doing a compliance review of the Company s alleged failure to report small breaches of protected health information related to its pharmacy operations (e.g., any incident involving less than 500 individuals).  On September 4, 2015, the Company submitted its response to OCR s letter.  While the Company does not believe that a loss is probable by reason of the compliance review, the Company believes that a loss is reasonably possible; however, at this time the Company cannot estimate a range of possible losses because the OCR's review is at the early stages and the Company does not know if OCR will find a violation(s) and, if so, what violation(s) and whether OCR will proceed with corrective action, issuance of penalties or monetary settlement.  The potential penalties related to the issues being investigated are up to   $50   thousand per violation (which can be counted per day) with a   $1.5   per calendar year maximum for multiple violations of a single provision (with the potential for finding violations of multiple provisions each with a separate   $1.5   per calendar year maximum); however, as noted above, any actual penalties will be determined only after consideration by OCR of various factors, including the nature of any violation, remedial actions taken by the Company and other factors determined relevant by OCR.  
  Predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposures involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes, costs and exposures to vary materially from current expectations. The Company regularly monitors its exposure to the loss contingencies associated with these matters and may from time to time change its predictions with respect to outcomes and its estimates with respect to related costs and exposures. 
  With respect to the IOS, Criminal Intrusion and OCR matters discussed above, the Company believes the chance of a material loss is remote. It is possible, although management believes that the likelihood is remote, that material differences in actual outcomes, costs and exposures relative to current predictions and estimates, or material changes in such predictions or estimates, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 15 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    
  Proposed Sale of Save-A-Lot 
  On October 16, 2016, the Company, Moran Foods, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Save-A-Lot ), Smith Acquisition Corp. (the  Purchaser ), an affiliate of Onex Partners Manager LP, and Smith Merger Sub Corp., a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser ( Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which the Purchaser will acquire the Save-A-Lot business of the Company.  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the  Closing ), Merger Sub will merge with and into Save-A-Lot, with Save-A-Lot surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser, and the membership units of Save-A-Lot held by the Company will be converted into the right to receive from Purchaser at the Closing   $1.365   billion in cash, subject to working capital, indebtedness and other customary adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The transaction is currently expected to be completed by January 31, 2017, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  
  As of September 10, 2016, the Save-A-Lot business incorporated net assets of approximately   $620   to   $630   that SUPERVALU expects to dispose of through the sale of the Save-A-Lot business. Upon completion of the sale of the Save-A-Lot business, the Company will use a portion of the cash proceeds, net of the transaction-related fees, expenses and taxes, to make a mandatory prepayment of   $750   against the Company s outstanding balance under the Secured Term Loan Facility. The Company anticipates making an additional   $50   to   $100   payment against the Secured Term Loan Facility balance to bring the Total Secured Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis giving effect to such prepayment to be no higher than   1.50  :1.00. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds, estimated to be in the range of   $275   to   $350   after customary adjustments at closing, to further reduce debt and improve its capital structure as well as to fund corporate and growth initiatives. 
  The Merger Agreement will result in the classification of assets and liabilities of the Save-A-Lot business as held-for-sale as of the Company s third quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company will assess the carrying value of its assets held-for-sale for impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to asses if the carrying value of the respective assets exceed their estimated fair value, prior to measuring the held-for-sale business at fair value less cost to sell.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  (Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data) 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the information contained under the caption  Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the information in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . 
  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  Second Quarter of Fiscal 2017 Highlights 
  Financial highlights for the     second     quarter of fiscal     2017     compar  ed to the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   include: 
             
    Net sales were   $3,865  , a decrease of   $197   or   4.8 percent  , primarily due to lost Wholesale customers, lower identical store sales in our Retail and Save-A-Lot businesses, and closed Save-A-Lot stores, offset in part by new Wholesale stores and customers, and new corporate Save-A-Lot and Retail stores. 
                
    Gross profit was   $562  , a decrease of   $21   or   3.6 percent  , which reflects declines in Retail and Wholesale sales and lower transition services fees, offset in part by higher gross margins in Save-A-Lot and Wholesale. 
                
    Operating earnings were   $88  , a decrease of   $6   or   6.4 percent  , primarily due to lower gross profit from decreased sales and higher employee-related costs from new stores, offset in part by higher base margins in Save-A-Lot and Wholesale, and lower pension expense.  
     Year-To-Date Fiscal 2017 Highlights  
  Financial highlights for the year-to-date period of fiscal 2017 compared to the year-to-date period of fiscal 2016 include: 
             
    Net sales were   $9,061  , a   decrease   of   $408   or   4.3 percent  , primarily due to lost Wholesale customers, lower identical store sales in our Retail and Save-A-Lot businesses, lower sales to existing Wholesale customers and closed Save-A-Lot stores, offset in part by new corporate Save-A-Lot and Retail stores, and new Wholesale stores and customers. 
                
    Gross profit was   $1,341  , a decrease of   $52   or   3.7 percent  , which reflects declines in Retail and Wholesale sales and lower transition services fees, offset in part by higher base margins in Save-A-Lot and Wholesale. 
                
    Operating earnings were   $221  , a decrease of   $31   or   12.3 percent  , primarily due to lower gross profit from decreased sales and higher employee-related costs from new stores, offset in part by higher base margins in Save-A-Lot and Wholesale and lower pension expense. 
                
    Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was   $275  , a decrease of   $1  , primarily due to  lower cash generated from earnings and higher levels of cash utilized in operating assets and liabilities, offset by lower contributions to benefit plans. 
                
    Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was   $115  , a decrease of   $4  , primarily due to a net decrease in cash paid for intangible and other assets, offset in part by an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures. 
                
    Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was   $163  , an increase of   $138  , primarily due to an increase in revolving debt repayments and the $99 mandatory prepayment of the Secured Term Loan Facility made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as described in   Note 6 Long-Term Debt   in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  Recent Developments 
  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company paid $17 to acquire 22 Food Lion stores located in northern West Virginia, western Maryland, south central Pennsylvania and northwestern Virginia. The acquisition included certain store assets, including inventories, property, plant, and equipment, and capital and operating leases. The acquired stores were converted to the Company's Shop  N Save format that is currently used by some of the Company's Wholesale customers in that region and will at least initially be operated by the Company's Retail segment. The Company is in discussions with certain of its wholesale customers and the Federal Trade Commission on potential structures that would allow these wholesale customers to have an interest in these stores at some future date. 
  In August 2016, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement to serve as a grocery wholesaler and distributor to The Fresh Market. The Fresh Market operates over 170 stores across the U.S. The Company has begun piloting store transitions, and expects to begin transitioning stores in early calendar 2017. 
  In July 2016, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with Indiana-based Marsh Supermarkets to serve as its primary grocery wholesaler and to provide certain professional services to the grocery chain. Marsh currently operates approximately 70 Marsh Supermarkets and O Malia Food Markets across Indiana and Ohio. The transition of stores is complete. 
  Proposed Sale of Save-A-Lot 
  On October 16, 2016, the Company, Moran Foods, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Save-A-Lot ), Smith Acquisition Corp. (the  Purchaser ), an affiliate of Onex Partners Manager LP, and Smith Merger Sub Corp., a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser ( Merger Sub ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which the Purchaser will acquire the Save-A-Lot business of the Company.  On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the  Closing ), Merger Sub will merge with and into Save-A-Lot, with Save-A-Lot surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser, and the membership units of Save-A-Lot held by the Company will be converted into the right to receive from Purchaser at the Closing   $1.365   billion in cash, subject to working capital, indebtedness and other customary adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The transaction is currently expected to be completed by January 31, 2017, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

As of September 10, 2016, the Save-A-Lot business incorporated net assets of approximately   $620   to   $630   that SUPERVALU expects to dispose of through the sale of the Save-A-Lot business. Upon completion of the sale of the Save-A-Lot business, the Company will use a portion of the cash proceeds, net of the transaction-related fees, expenses and taxes, to make a mandatory prepayment of $750 against the Company s outstanding balance under the Secured Term Loan Facility. The Company anticipates making an additional $50 to $100 payment against the Secured Term Loan Facility balance to bring the Total Secured Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis giving effect to such prepayment to be no higher than 1.50:1.00. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds, estimated to be in the range of   $275   to   $350   after customary adjustments at closing, to further reduce debt and improve its capital structure as well as to fund corporate and growth initiatives. 
  The Merger Agreement will result in the classification of assets and liabilities of the Save-A-Lot business as held-for-sale as of the Company s third quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company will assess the carrying value of its assets held-for-sale for impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to asses if the carrying value of the respective assets exceed their estimated fair value, prior to measuring the held-for-sale business at fair value less cost to sell. 
  Impact of Inflation and Deflation 
  The Company monitors product cost inflation and deflation and evaluates whether to absorb cost increases or decreases, or pass on pricing changes. The Company has experienced a mix of inflation and deflation across product categories within all three of its business segments during the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  , with higher levels of deflation within the meat and egg product categories. 
  In aggregate across all of the Company s businesses and taking into account the mix of products, management estimates the Company s businesses experienced low single digit cost deflation in the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017  . All segments sustained cost deflation within the meat and egg product categories. Management estimates Save-A-Lot incurred cost deflation in the mid-to-high single digits as a percentage in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Cost deflation continues to be greater within Save-A-Lot, particularly within its licensee distribution business, compared to Wholesale and Retail, due to product mix and product sourcing on private-label products. Cost deflation estimates are based on individual like items sold by the Company during the periods compared. 
  Changes in merchandising, customer buying habits and competitive pressures create inherent difficulties in measuring the impact of inflation and deflation on Net sales and Gross profit. 
  Competitive Environment 
  The United States grocery channel is highly competitive and management expects operating results will continue to be impacted by the effects of operating in a highly competitive and price-sensitive marketplace. In fiscal 2017 year-to-date, the Company's Retail segment has been impacted to a greater degree than anticipated by price competition, competitive store openings and a challenging sales and operating environment for its stores. These factors affecting the Retail segment are expected to impact the second half of fiscal 2017 as well.  
  Services Agreements 
  The Company provides back-office administrative support services under the TSA with NAI and Albertson's LLC and is also providing services as needed to transition and wind down the TSA with NAI and Albertson's LLC. The Company estimates that the complete transition and wind down of the TSA with NAI and Albertson's LLC could take approximately two to three more years. In September 2016, NAI and Albertson's LLC each notified the Company that it was again exercising its right to renew the term of their respective TSA for an additional year, which extended the expiration date of the NAI and Albertson's LLC TSA to September 21, 2018, unless renewed again by notice given no later than September 21, 2017. 
  In connection with Haggen s bankruptcy process, Haggen has now closed or sold all 164 of its stores. The transition and wind down of the Haggen transition services agreement occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with the Company now providing limited services in connection with the wind down of the Haggen estate. 
  The Company is focused on driving professional services sales to existing and new customers through enhanced offerings, including merchandise and promotional planning, store design and back-office technical and financial services, which is one component of the Company s plans to mitigate the impact of the wind down of the transition services agreements with NAI, Albertson's LLC and Haggen. 
  In connection with the sale of Save-A-Lot, the Company and Save-A-Lot will enter into a five-year professional services agreement under which the Company will provide Save-A-Lot with certain services and support functions for its day-to-day operations, including cloud services, merchandising technology, payroll, finance, and other technology and hosting services.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  
  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). In addition to the above analysis of results of operations, the Company also

     Table of Contents  

considers certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of its business and understand underlying operating performance and core business trends, which it uses to facilitate operating performance comparisons of its business on a consistent basis over time. The measures and items identified below, such as Adjusted EBITDA, are provided as a supplement to the Company's results of operations and related analysis, and should not be considered superior to, a substitute for or an alternative to any financial measure of performance prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In each of these measures, certain items are being omitted either because they are non-cash items or are items that are not considered in the Company's supplemental assessment of on-going business performance. Certain of these adjustments are considered in similar supplemental analyses by other companies, such as Depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and certain other adjustments.  
  The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional understanding of other factors and trends affecting its business, which are used in the business planning process to understand expected performance, to evaluate results against those expectations, and as one of the compensation performance measures under certain compensation programs and plans. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is more reflective of factors that affect its underlying operating performance and facilitate operating performance comparisons of our business segments on a consistent basis over time.  
  Limitations of Use 
  Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflected below exclude certain items that may be recurring in nature and may be reflected in the Company's financial results for the foreseeable future. These measurements and items may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. All measurements are provided with a reconciliation from a GAAP measurement. The non-GAAP financial measures below should only be considered as an additional supplement to the Company s financial results reported in accordance with GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company s results reported in accordance with GAAP in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . 
  There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure including, but not limited to, it not reflecting cash expenditures for capital assets or contractual commitments, changes in working capital, income taxes and debt service expenses that are recurring in the Company's results of operations. 
  Definitions 
  The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations, plus Interest expense, net and Income tax provision (benefit), less Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus non-GAAP adjustments for Depreciation and amortization, LIFO charge (credit), certain employee-related costs and pension-related charges (including severance costs, pension settlement charges, multiemployer pension withdrawal charges, accelerated stock-based compensation charges and other items), certain non-cash asset impairment and other charges (including asset write-offs, store closures and market exits), certain gains and losses on the sale of property, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, costs related to the separation of businesses, legal settlement charges and gains, contract breakage costs and certain other non-cash charges or items, as determined by management.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Liquidity and Capital Resource Highlights 
              
    In fiscal 2017 year-to-date, the Secured Term Loan Credit Facility was amended to permit SUPERVALU and its subsidiaries to undertake certain transactions reasonably determined by SUPERVALU to be necessary to effectuate a separation of Save-A-Lot. The interest rate for the term loan increased from LIBOR plus 3.50 percent to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent with a floor on LIBOR remaining at 1.00 percent subject to a further increase of 0.25 percent if certain credit rating conditions are not satisfied. 
                
    As of   September 10, 2016  , scheduled debt maturities and mandatory prepayments due in the remainder of fiscal 2017 were $0, exclusive of any potential prepayment requirements under the Secured Term Loan Facility in the event of a separation of the Save-A-Lot business. 
                 
    Working capital increased   $80   to   $358   as of   September 10, 2016   from   $278   as of   February 27, 2016  , excluding the impacts of the LIFO reserve, primarily due to the reduction in current maturities of long-term debt related to the $99 mandatory prepayment of the Secured Term Loan Facility made in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and higher inventories within Wholesale, Save-A-Lot and Retail, partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable. 
                
    Management expects that the Company will be able to fund debt maturities through internally generated funds, borrowings under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility, additional term loans under the Secured Term Loan Facility (subject to identifying term loan lenders or other institutional lenders and satisfying certain terms and conditions) or through new debt issuances. 
                
    In connection with the sale of Save-A-Lot, the Company will prepay loans outstanding under the Secured Term Loan Facility with 100% of the first $750 of Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the facility) received and with 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $750 up to an aggregate amount that would cause the Total Secured Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such prepayment to be no higher than 1.50:1.00. 
                 
    No minimum pension contributions are required under ERISA for fiscal 2017.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Management expects that the Company will continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds and pay down debt obligations with internally generated funds and new debt issuances or existing credit facilities. A significant reduction in operating earnings or the incurrence of operating losses could have a negative impact on the Company s operating cash flow, which may limit the Company s ability to pay down its outstanding indebtedness as planned. The Company's credit facilities are secured by a substantial portion of the Company's total assets and certain subsidiary equity interests.  
  The Company s primary sources of liquidity are from internally generated funds and from borrowing capacity under its credit facilities. The Company will continue to obtain short-term or long-term financing from its credit facilities. Long-term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances and its credit facilities. The Company s short-term and long-term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund debt obligations and capital expenditures as opportunities arise. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels or that it will continually have access to credit on acceptable terms. Maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities.  
  Primary uses of cash include debt servicing and maturities, capital expenditures, working capital maintenance, contributions to various benefit plans and income tax payments. The Company s working capital needs are generally greater during the months leading up to high sales periods, such as the time period from prior to Thanksgiving through December. The Company typically finances these working capital needs with cash provided from operating activities and short-term borrowings. Inventories are managed primarily through demand forecasting and replenishing depleted inventories. Strategic and operational investments in the Company s businesses are funded by cash provided from operating activities and on a short-term basis through available liquidity.  
  The Company s continued access to short-term and long-term financing through credit markets depends on numerous factors including the condition of the credit markets and the Company s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and credit ratings. 
  The Company does not pay dividends, and there is no current intent to pay dividends. The Company is limited in the aggregate amount of dividends that it may pay under the terms of its Secured Term Loan Facility and its Revolving ABL Credit Facility and would need to meet certain conditions under these credit facilities before paying a dividend, as described in   Note 6 Long-Term Debt   in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and the requirements of Delaware law, and will depend on a variety of factors that the Company s Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
  Cash Flow Information 
  The following summarizes our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in fiscal   2017   year-to-date compared to last year is primarily due to lower cash generated from earnings and higher levels of cash utilized in operating assets and liabilities, offset in part by $36 of lower contributions to benefit plans. 
  The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal   2017   year-to-date compared to last year is primarily due to a $21 decrease in cash paid for intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $16 increase in cash paid for capital expenditures. 
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal   2017   year-to-date compared to last year is primarily due to a $126 net increase in cash paid towards debt and capital lease obligations, and a $9 decrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock. 
  Credit Facilities and Debt Agreements 
  Total debt and capital lease obligations, net of unamortized debt financing costs and original issue discount,   decreased     $139   to   $2,385   as of   September 10, 2016   from   $2,524   as of   February 27, 2016  . The decrease in total debt and capital lease obligations is primarily due to a $103 reduction of borrowing under the Secured Term Loan Facility, including the $99 excess cash flow prepayment that was required to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a $38 reduction in borrowings under the Revolving ABL Credit Facility and $13 of payments to reduce capital leases, offset in part by $8 of non-cash amortization of debt financing costs and original issue discount and $7 of non-cash capital lease additions. 
  Refer to   Note 6 Long-Term Debt   in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed discussion of the provisions of the Company's credit facilities and certain long-term debt agreements and additional information. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Capital expenditures in fiscal   2017   year-to-date were   $117  , including capital lease additions but excluding cash paid for business acquisitions, and primarily consisted of investments in new Save-A-Lot corporate and Retail stores, store remodels and information technology investments. In addition, during fiscal   2017   year-to-date, the Company paid   $6   for eight acquired stores. Capital expenditures and cash paid for licensee business acquisitions for fiscal   2017   are projected to be approximately $325 to $350, including capital lease additions. 
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations 
  Cash contributions to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were   $2   and   $38   in fiscal   2017   and   2016   year-to-date, respectively. The decrease in contributions is primarily due to a $25 discretionary contribution and an $11 contribution in connection with the closing of a postretirement benefit plan audit made in fiscal 2016 year-to-date. 
  The Company anticipates fiscal   2017   discretionary pension contributions and required minimum other postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately   $30   to   $35  , which primarily reflect discretionary defined benefit pension contributions. The Company currently expects that no minimum contributions will be required to the Company's pension plans in fiscal 2017.  
  The Company funds its defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum contribution amount required under ERISA, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws, as determined by the Company s external actuarial consultant, and additional contributions made at the Company's discretion. The Company may accelerate contributions or undertake contributions in excess of the minimum requirements from time to time subject to the availability of cash in excess of operating and financing needs or other factors as may be applicable. The Company assesses the relative attractiveness of the use of cash to accelerate contributions considering such factors as expected return on assets, discount rates, cost of debt, reducing or eliminating required PBGC variable rate premiums or in order to achieve exemption from participant notices of underfunding.

  In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company entered into the third amendment to the Secured Term Loan Facility in relation to its work to prepare for the potential separation of the Save-A-Lot business. This third amendment increased the interest rate for the Secured Term Loan Facility from LIBOR plus 3.50 percent to LIBOR plus 4.50 percent with the floor on LIBOR remaining at 1.00 percent, subject to further increase of 0.25 percent if certain rating conditions are not satisfied. Interest on long-term debt contractual obligations increased $10 for fiscal 2017, $28 for fiscal 2018-2019 and $3 for fiscal 2020-2021 as a result of the amendment.

  Completion of Proposed Sale of Save-A-Lot 
  The Company has entered into a Merger Agreement providing for the sale of its Save-A-Lot business to an affiliate of Onex Partners Manager LP for a purchase price of $1.365 billion in cash, subject to working capital, indebtedness and other customary adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The process of consummating the proposed sale of Save-A-Lot may be disruptive to the Company s business operations, may distract the Company s management team from their day-to-day responsibilities and could make it more difficult to retain employees.  The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, which may not be obtained or satisfied, and as a result and due to other factors outside the Company s control, the sale may not be completed on the timing currently contemplated, or at all. Any of these risks or uncertainties, including the inability to complete the proposed sale in the time period and on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
