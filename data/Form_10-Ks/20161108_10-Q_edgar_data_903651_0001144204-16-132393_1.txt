1.    Description of Business and
                                         Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Description of
Business- Innodata Inc. (the  Company ) is a global digital services and solutions company. The Company s
technology and services power leading information products and online retail destinations around the world. The Company s
solutions help prestigious enterprises harness the power of digital data to re-imagine how they operate and drive performance.
The Company serves publishers, media and information companies, digital retailers, banks, insurance companies, government agencies
and many other industries. 

The Company operates
in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) and Media Intelligence Solutions
(MIS). DDS was formerly known as Content Services. 

The Company s
DDS segment provides solutions to digital retailers, information services companies, publishers and enterprises that have one
or more of the following broad business requirements: development of digital content (including e-books); development of new digital
information products; and operational support of existing digital information products and systems. 

The Company s
IADS segment designs and develops new capabilities to enable clients in the financial services, insurance, medical and healthcare
sectors to improve decision-support through digital technologies. IADS operates through two subsidiaries: Synodex offers a range
of services for healthcare, medical and insurance companies, and docGenix provides services to financial services institutions.
As of September 30, 2016, Innodata owned 91% of Synodex and 94% of docGenix, both limited liability companies. 

The Company s
MIS segment provides media monitoring and analysis software and professional services for organizations of all sizes. Through
innovative web-based and mobile solutions, MIS reduces the time and effort it takes to gather, analyze and distribute valuable
business intelligence extracted from traditional and social media sources. Through Bulldog Reporter, MIS provides PR industry
newsletters, a journalist database, media intelligence and professional development programs. The Company s MIS segment
operates through its MediaMiser, Bulldog Reporter and Agility subsidiaries. 

In July 2016, the
MediaMiser subsidiary acquired Agility from PR Newswire under an asset purchase agreement. Agility is a leading global media contact
database and media monitoring platform that helps customers target key influencers, amplify content and measure impact. The solution
is offered as software-as-a-service (SaaS). MediaMiser acquired Agility to foster growth in North America and Europe by bolstering
MediaMiser s media intelligence solutions and media databases, improving its media outreach capabilities, and delivering
stronger, more data-powered media intelligence to clients. With the acquisition of Agility, MediaMiser is now one of only a handful
of companies able to offer a global media contact dataset with integrated workflows for distribution, monitoring and measurement. 

Basis of Presentation -The
condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated
financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the results of its operations and comprehensive loss for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows and stockholders  equity for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected
for any other interim period or for the full year. 

INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
AND 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended
December 31, 2015, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, the accounting policies used
in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those described in the December 31, 2015 consolidated
financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation -The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MediaMiser, a corporation
in which the Company owns substantially all of the economic interest, and the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies
that are majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies
are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates -In
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to revenue recognition,
allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred
tax assets, valuation of securities underlying stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, pension benefits, purchase price
allocation of the assets acquired in the acquisition of Agility, valuation of derivative instruments and estimated accruals for
various tax exposures. 

Foreign Currency
Translation -The functional currency for the Company s production operations located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka
and Israel is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees and Israeli shekels
are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on transaction dates. 

The functional currency
of the foreign subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada and United Kingdom are the euro, Canadian dollar and pound sterling, respectively.
The financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated
from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in our condensed consolidated
financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the
fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments
are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction
gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss. 

Revenue Recognition -For
the DDS segment, revenue is recognized based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized, the period in which services are
performed and delivered. Revenues for contracts billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed.
Revenues under fixed-fee contracts, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized on the percentage of completion
method of accounting, as services are performed or milestones are achieved.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
AND 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

For the IADS segment,
revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered and the period in which services are performed and deliverables
are made as per contracts. A portion of our IADS segment revenue is derived from licensing our software and providing access to
our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services are recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the
end user and there are no significant remaining obligations, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed
or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. 

The MIS segment derives
its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. Revenue from subscriptions
is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user and there are no significant remaining obligations,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues
from enriched media analysis services are recognized when the services are performed and delivered to the clients. 

Revenues include reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements - In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This update
is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
It also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain
or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within
those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of 2017. Companies may use
either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the new standard when it takes effect. The Company has
not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015,
the FASB issued guidance related to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires that deferred tax
assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The new guidance is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company does not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

In February 2016,
the FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use
asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms
greater than 12 months.  The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the
amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective
transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  This new
guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early application is permitted.  The
Company has not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued guidance relating to share based compensation. This new guidance is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016.  Early application is permitted.  The Company does not anticipate that adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

2.    Property and Equipment    

Property and equipment
are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation and amortization (in thousands), and consist of the following: 

Depreciation and amortization
expense of property and equipment was approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment was approximately $1.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

3.    Acquisitions    

On July 14, 2016,
Innodata s MediaMiser subsidiary completed the acquisition of Agility from PR Newswire under an asset purchase agreement
for a cash consideration of $4.1 million. 

Agility is a leading
global media contact database and media monitoring platform that helps customers target key influencers, amplify content and measure
impact. The solution is offered as software-as-a-service (SaaS). 

MediaMiser acquired
Agility to foster growth in North America and Europe by bolstering MediaMiser s media intelligence solutions and media databases,
improving its media outreach capabilities, and delivering stronger, more data-powered media intelligence to clients. With the
acquisition of Agility, MediaMiser is now one of only a handful of companies able to offer a global media contact dataset with
integrated workflows for distribution, monitoring and measurement. 

As this acquisition
was effective on July 14, 2016, the results of operations of Agility are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements
for the period beginning July 14, 2016. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. This
method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of
the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.   

The Company has obtained
third party valuations of certain intangible assets. The following table summarizes (in thousands) the preliminary purchase price
allocation for the acquisition:

The estimated fair
value of the media contact database and tradenames and trademarks intangible assets was determined using the  relief from
royalty method  under the income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of
an asset based on the cost savings that are available through ownership of the asset by the avoidance of paying royalties to license
the use of the asset from another owner. The estimated fair value of the developed technology was determined based on the cost
approach, which measures the value by the cost to reconstruct or replace the platform with another of like utility. Some of the
more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the projected revenue associated with
the asset, the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the
assessment of each asset s life cycle, as well as other factors. The discount rate used to arrive at the present value of
the media contact database and tradenames and trademarks at the acquisition date, was 13.5%. The remaining useful lives of the
media contact database, developed technology, and tradenames and trademarks were based on historical product development cycles,
the projected rate of technology migration, a market participant s use of these intangible assets and the pattern of projected
economic benefit of these intangible assets. 

The amounts assigned
to the media contact database, developed technology, tradenames and trademarks are amortized over the estimated useful life of
10 years.  

The Company
funded the purchase price from its available cash on hand. Transaction expenses amounted to $0.1 million and have been
expensed. 

The following unaudited
pro forma summary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2015
(amount in thousands, except per share amounts). The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated
as of that time or that may result in the future.

tax benefits relating to interest and penalties was approximately $0.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, if recognized, would have an impact on
the Company s effective tax rate.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
AND 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

The following presents
a roll-forward of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 (amounts in thousands): 

The Company is subject
to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to
examination by Federal tax authorities for years prior to 2006 and by New Jersey tax authorities for years prior to 2012. Various
foreign subsidiaries currently have open tax years from 2003 through 2016. 

Pursuant to an income
tax audit by the Indian Bureau of Taxation in 2009, the Company s Indian subsidiaries received a tax assessment approximating
$312,000 including interest, through September 30, 2016 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Management disagrees with the
basis of these tax assessments, has filed an appeal against the assessments and is contesting them vigorously. In January 2012,
the Indian subsidiary received a final tax assessment of approximately $1.0 million, including interest, for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2008, from the Indian Bureau of Taxation. Management disagrees with the basis of this tax assessment, and has filed
an appeal against it. Due to this assessment, the Company recorded a tax provision amounting to $496,000 including interest through
September 30, 2016. In April 2015, the Company received a favorable judgment whereby the Appeal Officer reduced the tax assessment
to $0.3 million. Under the Indian Income Tax Act, however, the income tax assessing officer has the right to appeal against the
judgment passed by the Appeal Officer. In the third quarter of 2015, the income tax assessing officer exercised this right and
filed an appeal. Based on recent experience, management believes that the tax provision of $496,000 including interest is adequate.
As the Company is continually subject to tax audits by the Indian Bureau of Taxation, the Company continuously assesses the likelihood
of an unfavorable assessment for all fiscal years for which the Company has not been audited and, as of September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded a tax provision amounting to $158,000 including interest for such year. 

In 2015 the Company s
Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Bureau in India regarding the classification of services provided
by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and
database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that
are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary s service tax filings. In the event the Service
Tax Bureau is successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services the revenues earned by the Company s
Indian subsidiary would be subject to a service tax of approximately 14.5% of revenues and this would increase the operating costs
of the Company by an equivalent amount. The revenues of the Company s Indian subsidiary for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $12.7 million. The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Bureau s position and is contesting these assertions
vigorously.

In 2016 the Company s
Indian subsidiary received notices of appeal from the Commissioner, Service Tax, seeking to reverse service tax refunds previously
granted to our Indian subsidiary for certain quarters in 2014 and 2015, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary
fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The Company disagrees with the basis of these appeals and is contesting
them vigorously. The Company expects delays in receiving service tax refunds until such time as the appeals are adjudicated with
finality. 

From time to time
the Company is also subject to various other tax proceedings and claims for its India and Philippines subsidiaries. The Company
has recorded a tax provision amounting to $222,000 including interest through September 30, 2016, for several other ongoing tax
proceedings in India and the Philippines. Although the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time, the Company continues
to contest these claims vigorously. 

In the third quarter
of 2016, the U.S. entity deferred $3.8 million in payments due to its Asian operating subsidiaries. The deferral in payments resulted
in a deemed dividend that is taxable income to the U.S. entity and is set off against its net operating loss carryforwards. The
Company projects that during the period from October 1, 2016 through 2018 the U.S. entity may not have sufficient cash to pay
in full amounts that will be payable by it to the Company s Asian operating subsidiaries and that the cash deficit will
amount to approximately $2.2 million. The resulting deferral in payments would similarly result in a deemed dividend that would
be taxable income to the U.S. entity and would be set off against its net operating loss carryforwards. The Company adjusted its
deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance as of September 30, 2016 to reflect the projected deferral through
2018. 

6.    Commitments and Contingencies    

Litigation- In
2008, the Supreme Court of the Republic of the Philippines refused to review a decision of the Court of Appeals in Manila against
a Philippines subsidiary of the Company that is inactive and has no material assets, and purportedly also against Innodata Inc.,
that orders the reinstatement of certain former employees of the subsidiary to their former positions and also orders the payment
of back wages and benefits that aggregate approximately $8.0 million. Based on consultation with legal counsel, the Company believes
that recovery against the Company is unlikely.  

The Company is also
subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.  

While management currently
believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated
financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial
recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and
unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the
period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company s estimate of potential impact on the Company s
consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above legal proceedings could change in
the future.

  (Unaudited)  

The Company s
legal reserves related to legal proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The
Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The reserves
are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could
reach approximately $100,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company
may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

Foreign Currency -To
the extent that the currencies of the Company s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel
fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain client projects.
In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and
on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. 

Indemnifications -The
Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, certain officers and employees against costs and liabilities
incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director
and/or officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain clients pursuant to whom the Company
has agreed to indemnify the client for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary
course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnifications. 

Liens -In connection
with the procurement of tax incentives at one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries, the foreign zoning authority was granted
a first lien on the subsidiary s property and equipment. As of September 30, 2016, the net book value of the property and
equipment was $0.5 million. 

7.    Stock Options

transaction were $0.9 million. The Company leased the equipment for a period of 36 months at an effective interest rate of approximately
6% and has the option to purchase the equipment for a nominal amount at the end of the lease term. The Company has accounted for
this transaction as a financing arrangement, wherein the equipment remains on the Company s books and will continue to be
depreciated. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had made $0.8 million in lease payments under the sale leaseback agreement. 

(2)  Deferred

11.     Income (Loss) Per Share   

Basic net income (loss)
per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss)
per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock,
the  two-class  method of computing income per share is used. 

Options to purchase
4.2 million shares and 3.4 million shares of common stock for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, because the options exercise price
was greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In addition,
diluted net income (loss) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 does not include 0.3 million potential shares
of common stock derived from the exercise of stock options, because as a result of the Company s incurring losses, their
effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

Options to purchase
4.2 million shares and 2.6 million shares of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, because the options exercise price
was greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been anti-dilutive. In addition,
diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 does not include 0.3 million and 0.8 million
potential shares of common stock, respectively, derived from the exercise of stock options, because as a result of the Company s
incurring losses, their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

The Company conducts
a large portion of its operations in international markets that subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant
foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to
generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company s primary exchange rate exposure relates to payroll,
other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. 

In addition, although
the majority of the Company s revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of the total revenues is denominated
in Canadian dollars, pound sterling and euros.

To manage its exposure
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts, authorized under
Company policies, with counterparties that were highly rated financial institutions. The Company utilized non-deliverable forward

The accounting standard
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels
are defined as follows: 

Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted price in active market
for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2:  Observable inputs other than those included
in Level 1. 

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting management s
own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 

The following table
sets forth the assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that the Company measured at fair
value, on a recurring basis by level, within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands). As required by the standard, assets and
liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to
their fair value measurement. 

The Level 2 assets
and liabilities contain foreign currency forward contracts. Fair value is determined based on the observable market transactions
of spot and forward rates. The fair value of these contracts as of September 30, 2016 is included in prepaid and other current
assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2015 is

Business Overview  

Innodata (NASDAQ:
INOD) is a global digital services and solutions company. Our technology and services power leading information products
and online retail destinations around the world. Our solutions help prestigious enterprises harness the power of digital
data to re-imagine how they operate and drive performance. We serve publishers, media and information companies, digital retailers,
banks, insurance companies, government agencies and many other industries. Founded in 1988, we comprise a team of 5,000 diverse
people in eight countries who are dedicated to delivering services and solutions that help the world embrace digital data as a
means of enhancing our lives and transforming our businesses. 

We operate in three
reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS) and Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS).
Our DDS segment provides solutions to digital retailers, information services companies, publishers and enterprises that have
one or more of the following broad business requirements: development of digital content (including e-books); development of new
digital information products; and operational support of existing digital information products and systems. The DDS segment was
formerly known as Content Services. 

Many of our clients
are driving or are responding to rapid and fundamental changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information.
For some of our publishing and information services clients, this means transforming information products from print to digital;
for others, it means migrating already-digital products from web-only distribution to multiple-channel distribution that includes
mobile and tablet devices and incorporates mobility, social platform and semantic search; and for others still, it means re-tooling
pure search-based information products into workflow-embedded analytical tools that combine content with software to enable context-aware
decision-making; and for a select number of our information services clients, it means embracing the content-as-a-service model
to integrate content with other tools, applications and data. Each of these transformations requires shifts in products, as well
as the technology and the operations that support them. 

For our enterprise
publishing clients, changes in the way end users discover, consume and create published information often necessitates replacing
old processes and technologies that generated static, whole documents with new processes and technologies that enable content
to reside as modular components which are re-combined dynamically to create up-to-date, product-specific assembly guides, engineering
diagrams/schematics, compliance documentation, field operations guides and clinical documentation destined simultaneously for
the web, tablets and smartphones. 

By blending consulting,
technology and operations sourcing, along with deep domain expertise, we provide measurable outcomes for publishing companies,
information services companies and enterprises through business transformation, accelerating innovation and efficient operations. 

We are one of the
largest producers of e-books, serving four of the five leading digital retailers of e-books, as well as 80 leading trade, education
and professional publishers that sell e-books. We manufacture both standard e-books and interactive e-books in a variety of formats
(including EPUB, Mobi and Kindle) and in 12 major languages (including Japanese and Chinese). In addition, we distribute e-books
on behalf of publishers and authors to more than 25 e-book retailers across North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and 24
countries in the European Union. Since the fall of 2011, we have produced over 1,000,000 e-book titles. 

We help our clients
develop high-value information products. Our clients include four of the ten largest information industry companies in the world,
spanning financial, legal, healthcare and scientific information. 

We work with clients
at a strategic business and technology level to address business process and technology challenges related to digital content
supply chain optimization and strategy. By aligning operations and technology with business goals, we help businesses accelerate
new product development and introduction; control cost; consolidate and leverage technology investment; and obtain benefits of
scale. 

Many enterprises are
embracing new digital information technologies and workflow processes within their operations in order to improve internal decision-support
systems. We formed our IADS segment in mid-2011 to design and develop new capabilities to enable clients in the financial services,
insurance, medical and healthcare sectors to improve decision-support through digital technologies. We believe that by creating
and commercializing innovative business strategies and technology solutions we will be able to accelerate our growth and reduce
our revenue volatility. 

Our IADS segment operates
through our Synodex and docGenix subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016 we owned 91% of Synodex and 94% of docGenix. 

The main focus of
the Synodex business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured medical records in an innovative way to provide
improved data service capabilities for insurance underwriting, insurance claims, medical records management and clinical trial
support services. Synodex has developed and deployed its APS.Extract    product for specific use with life insurance
underwriting and claims. 

The main focus of
the docGenix business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured legal documents in order to improve an organization s
ability to analyze documentation and feed actionable data to downstream applications. 

The IADS subsidiaries
have incurred losses since their inception in 2011. Our investment net of revenues in these subsidiaries in the third quarter
of 2016 was approximately $550,000 (consisting mainly of operating expenses). We wrote off all of the fixed assets of IADS in
the third quarter of 2013 and have expensed all investments in IADS since that time. In the immediate future we intend to continue
to invest in these subsidiaries net of revenues at the combined rate of $0.5 to $0.7 million per quarter. 

MediaMiser, Bulldog
Reporter and Agility constitute the MIS segment. 

MediaMiser provides
media monitoring and analysis software and professional services to several Fortune 500 companies and Canadian government institutions,

In July 2016, our
MediaMiser subsidiary acquired the Agility business from PR Newswire. Agility is a leading global media contact database and media
monitoring platform that helps customers target key influencers, amplify content and measure impact. MediaMiser acquired Agility
to foster growth in North America and Europe by bolstering MediaMiser's media intelligence solutions and media databases, improving
its media outreach capabilities, and delivering stronger, more data-powered media intelligence to clients. With the acquisition
of Agility, MediaMiser is now one of only a handful of companies able to offer a global media contact dataset with integrated
workflows for distribution, monitoring and measurement. 

Our services are organized
and managed around three vectors: a vertical industry focus, a horizontal service/process focus, and a supportive operations focus. 

The vertically-aligned
groups understand our clients  businesses and strategic initiatives. The vertical group for each particular industry includes
experts hired from that industry. 

Our service/process-aligned groups include engineering personnel and delivery personnel. Our
engineering teams are responsible for creating secure and efficient custom workflows and integrating proprietary and third-party
technologies to automate manual processes and improve the consistency and quality of our work product. These tools include categorization
engines that utilize pattern recognition algorithms based on comprehensive rule sets and related heuristics, data extraction tools
that automatically retrieve specific types of information from large data sources, and workflow systems that enable various tasks
and activities to be performed across our multiple facilities.  

Our globally distributed
delivery personnel are responsible for executing our client engagements in accordance with service-level agreements. We deliver
services from facilities in the United States, India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Israel, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. 

Other support groups
are responsible for managing diverse enabling functions including human resources, organizational development, network and communications
technology infrastructure support and physical infrastructure and facilities management. 

Our sales staff, program managers and
consultants operate primarily from our North American and European locations, as well as from client sites. 

Recent Development  

As previously reported,
during the first quarter of 2016 the Company became aware of certain potentially improper payments and related transactions made
by or at the direction of certain foreign employees of a foreign subsidiary in connection with the inspection of the subsidiary s
compliance with local employment-related tax requirements. The Audit Committee initiated an internal investigation into this matter
with the assistance of independent counsel and other professionals, and voluntarily contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to advise them of the internal investigation. Based upon the Audit Committee s
investigation, which we believe has been substantially completed, the amounts in question are not material with respect to the
Company s financial condition or results of operations. The employees concerned are no longer employed by the subsidiary.
We are unable at this time to predict what, if any, action may be taken by governmental authorities or penalties or remedial measures
they may seek. As of September 30, 2016 we have incurred approximately $1.5 million in legal, professional and related costs and
expenses related to the investigation. We expect to incur up to $100,000 in additional costs relating to the investigation in
the fourth quarter. 

Revenues  

In our DDS segment
revenues are recognized based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized and in the period in which the services are performed
and once delivery has occurred. Revenues for contracts billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed.
Revenues under fixed-fee contracts, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized on the percentage of completion
method of accounting, as services are performed or milestones are achieved. 

In our IADS segment
we recognize revenues primarily based on the quantity delivered, and the period in which services are performed and deliverables
are made as per contracts. A portion of our IADS segment revenue is derived from licensing our software and providing access to
our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services are recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the
end user and there are no significant remaining obligations, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed
or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. 

Our MIS segment derives
its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. Revenue from subscriptions
are recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user and there are no significant remaining obligations,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues
from enriched media analysis services are recognized when the services are performed and delivered to the clients. 

We consider standard
accounting criteria for determining whether to report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent.  Factors
considered include whether we are the primary obligor, have risks and rewards of ownership, and bear the risk that a client may
not pay for the services performed.  If there are circumstances where the above criteria are not met and therefore we
are not the principal in providing services, amounts received from clients are presented net of payments in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

Revenues include reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs.  

Direct Operating Costs   

Direct operating costs
consist of direct payroll, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization,
travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency revaluation
gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients. 

Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Selling and administrative
expenses consist of management and administrative salaries, sales and marketing costs including commissions, new services research
and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs,
and other administrative overhead costs. 

Adjusted EBITDA Performance Metric  

In addition to measures
of financial performance presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we monitor  Adjusted EBITDA 
to help us evaluate our ongoing operating performance including our ability to operate the business effectively. 

We define Adjusted
EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP before income taxes, depreciation,
amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, stock-based compensation,
loss attributable to non-controlling interests and interest income (expense). 

We believe Adjusted
EBITDA is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance and for financial and operational decision-making
purposes. In particular, it facilitates comparisons of the core operating performance of our company from period to period on
a consistent basis and helps us to identify underlying trends in our business. We believe it provides useful information about
our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by the management in our financial and operational decision-making. We use this
measure to establish operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance.  

Adjusted EBITDA has
limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under GAAP.
Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments, and such
payments reflect a reduction in cash available to us; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements
for, our working capital needs and for our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes the potential dilutive impact
of stock-based compensation expense related to our workforce, interest income (expense) and net loss attributable to non-controlling
interests, and these items may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges,
the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital
expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and 

Other companies, including companies in our own industry,
may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from our calculation, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Adjusted EBITDA should
be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income. 

The following
table shows reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Results of Operations  

We acquired Agility
on July 14, 2016. The Results of Operations reflect the operations of Agility only for the period beginning on July 14, 2016 and
ending on September 30, 2016.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

Revenues  

Total revenues were
$16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of approximately $1.0 million or approximately 6%. 

Revenues from the
DDS segment were $12.1 million and $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease
of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 11%. This decrease is primarily attributable to reduced volume from e-book related
services that we perform for a key client and as a result of pricing concessions to another key client, offset in part by increases
in volume on a ramp-up on a new project for a European publisher and a ramp-up for a new customer for whom we began services in
the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Revenues
from the IADS segment were $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.5 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.5 million or 100%.   The increase primarily reflects
additional volume from Synodex clients.   

Revenues from the
MIS segment were $3.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase
of $1.5 million or approximately 125%. The increase is attributable to revenue of Agility from the date of acquisition to September
30, 2016. 

Two clients in the
DDS Segment generated approximately 27% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
34% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Another client in the DDS segment accounted
for less than 10% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 but accounted for 10% of
the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. No other client accounted for 10% or more of
total revenues during these periods. Further, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from non-U.S. clients
accounted for 48% and 52%, respectively, of the Company s total revenues. 

Direct Operating Costs   

Direct operating costs
were $12.4 million and $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of
$1.9 million or 18%. Direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to 79% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 69% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Direct operating costs
for the DDS segment were approximately $9.6 million and $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase of $0.7 million or 8%. The increase reflects an increase in labor costs, and also reflects foreign exchange losses
that resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment
revenues were 80% and 66% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Direct operating costs
for the IADS segment were $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, net of intersegment profits. The increase in direct operating costs for the IADS segment primarily reflects
an increase in production headcount. Direct operating costs for the IADS segment as a percentage of IADS segment revenues were
127% and 205% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs as
a percentage of IADS segment revenues is principally attributable to 100% increase in IADS revenues. 

Direct operating costs
for the MIS segment were $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
increase in direct operating costs was on account of costs of Agility recorded from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2016.
Included in Agility related costs are $0.1 million of one-time restructuring and integration costs. Direct operating costs for
the MIS segment as a percentage of MIS segment revenues were 50% and 53% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. This decline in direct operating costs as a percentage of MIS segment revenues reflects that the cost structure
of Agility relative to revenues is lower than the cost structure of MediaMiser. 

Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Selling and administrative
expenses were $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.2 million or approximately 31%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
revenues increased to 32% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 26% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Selling and administrative
expenses for the DDS segment were $3.3 million and $2.8 million in these respective periods, an increase of $0.5 million or 18%.
The increase primarily reflects new hire costs of sales personnel and $0.2 million of legal, professional and other costs in connection
with the internal investigation referred to under  Recent Development . Selling and administrative expenses for the
DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues increased to 27% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 20% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase as a percentage of revenues was caused by the increase in selling and
administrative expense and the decline in DDS segment revenues. 

Selling and administrative
expenses for the IADS segment were $0.3 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Selling and administrative
expenses for the IADS segment as a percentage of IADS segment revenues decreased to 26% for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to 73% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of IADS segment revenues was principally attributable to the 100% increase in IADS revenues. 

Selling and administrative
costs for the MIS segment were $1.5 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase reflects selling and administrative costs of Agility including $250,000 of one time restructuring and integration
costs, as well as new hire costs in MediaMiser. Selling and administrative expenses for the MIS segment as a percentage of MIS
segment revenues declined to 56% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 72% for the three months ended September 30,
2015. This decline reflects that the cost structure of Agility relative to revenues is lower than the cost structure of MediaMiser. 

Contingent Consideration  

On September 30, 2016
we and the other parties to the transaction in which we acquired MediaMiser amended the terms on which one of our subsidiaries
is required to make a supplemental purchase price payment for MediaMiser. On September 30, 2016 we and the other parties to the
MediaMiser acquisition amended the terms on which one of our subsidiaries is required to make a supplemental purchase price payment
for MediaMiser. Prior to the amendment, the amount of the supplemental purchase price payment was to be determined by the achievement
of certain financial thresholds and was in no event to exceed $3.8 million (C$5 million). The amendment fixed the amount of the
supplemental purchase price payment at $1.5 million (C$2 million) payable in two equal installments on March 31, 2017 and March
31, 2018 to designated recipients, except that no payments will be made to designated recipients who fail to satisfy specified
conditions. We have the option to pay up to 70% of the supplemental amount in shares of Innodata Inc. common stock. We recorded
a $1.0 million charge in our statement of operations for the third quarter of 2016 to reflect the amendment. 

Income Taxes  

We recorded a provision
for income taxes of $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Taxes
primarily consist of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries.
Effective income tax rates are disproportionate due to the losses incurred by our U.S. entity and our Canadian subsidiary and
a valuation allowance recorded on deferred taxes on these entities. Some of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax holidays
or preferential tax rates which reduce our overall effective tax rate when compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. In addition,
the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not subject to tax in the U.S. unless the earnings are repatriated. 

We have a valuation
allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we
also have a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of our MediaMiser subsidiary on account of continuing losses. 

Net Loss  

We incurred a net
loss of $2.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 
 compared to net income of $0.4 million during the three months ended  September
30, 2015 . 

Net loss for the DDS
segment was $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $1.6 million for the three months
ended  September 30, 2015 , net of intersegment profits. The change
was due to the decline in revenues and the increase in direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses that were
mentioned above, and to the charge to our operations referred to under  Contingent Consideration.  

Net loss for the IADS
segment was $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended  September
30, 2015 , net of intersegment profits. The decline in net loss is primarily due to an increase in revenues. 

Net loss for the MIS
segment was $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of $0.4 million compared to income of $1.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, an increased loss of $2.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was break-even compared to income of
$2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million
and a loss of $0.9 million for the IADS segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted
EBITDA was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 for the MIS segment. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015  

Revenues  

Total revenues were $47.4
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $43.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of approximately $4.4 million or approximately 10%. 

Revenues from the DDS
segment were $38.9 million and $38.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase
of $0.9 million or 2%. This increase is primarily attributable to a ramp-up on a new project for a European publisher and a ramp-up
for a new customer for whom services began in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was partially offset by reduced volume
from certain non e-book clients including as a result of pricing concessions extended to one key client. 

Revenues from the IADS
segment were $3.1 million and $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of
$1.7 million or 121%. The increase primarily reflects additional volume from Synodex clients. 

Revenues from the MIS
segment were $5.4 million and $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of
$1.8 million or approximately 50%. The increase is attributable to revenue of Agility from the date of acquisition to September
30, 2016. 

Two clients in the DDS
Segment generated approximately 30% of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 34%
of the Company s total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No other client accounted for 10% or more
of total revenues during these periods. Further, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from non-U.S.
clients accounted for 48% and 52%, respectively, of the Company s total revenues. 

Direct Operating Costs   

Direct operating costs
were $35.6 million and $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase
of $3.0 million or approximately 12%. Direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 75% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Direct operating costs
for the DDS segment were $28.8 million and $27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase of $1.3 million or 5%. The increase in direct operating costs primarily reflects $150,000 of costs incurred in connection
with the internal investigation referred to under  Recent Development , an increase in labor costs and the impact
of foreign exchange losses on account of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a
percentage of DDS segment revenues were 74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 72% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in direct operating costs as a percentage of DDS segment revenues primarily reflects an increase
in DDS segment direct operating costs relative to an increase in revenues. 

Direct operating costs
for the IADS segment were $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $3.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, net of intersegment profits, an increase of $0.6 million or 19%. The increase in direct operating costs for
the IADS segment primarily reflects an increase in production headcount. Direct operating costs for the IADS segment as a percentage
of IADS segment revenues were 119% and 221% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease
in direct operating costs as a percentage of IADS segment revenues was principally attributable to the 121% increase in IADS revenues. 

Direct operating costs
for the MIS segment were $3.1 million and $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase of $1.1 million or 55%. The increase in direct operating costs was on account of new hire costs, increase in content
acquisition costs, and costs of Agility recorded from the date of acquisition to September 30, 2016. Included in Agility related
costs are one-time restructuring and integration costs amounting to $0.1 million. Direct operating costs for the MIS segment as
a percentage of MIS segment revenues were 57% and 55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
increase in direct operating costs as a percentage of MIS segment is due to increase in costs in MediaMiser relative to the increase
in revenues. 

Selling and Administrative Expenses  

Selling and administrative
expenses were $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $12.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.1 million or approximately 17%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
revenues were 31% and 29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Selling and administrative
expenses for the DDS segment were $10.1 million and $8.7 million in these respective periods, an increase of $1.4 million or 16%.
The increase primarily reflects $1.5 million of legal, professional and other costs in connection with the internal investigation
referred to under  Recent Developments , as well as new hire costs. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS
segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues increased to 26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 23% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase as a percentage of revenues was caused by the increase in selling and administrative
expense relative to increase in DDS segment revenues. 

Selling and administrative
expenses for the IADS segment for the respective periods were $1.0 million and $1.2 million, net of intersegment profits, a decline
of $0.2 million or 17%. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses is on account of cost optimization. Selling and administrative
expenses for the IADS segment as a percentage of IADS segment revenues decreased to 32% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to 86% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of IADS segment revenues was principally attributable to the 121% increase in IADS revenues. 

Selling and administrative
costs for the MIS segment were $3.4 million and $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase reflects selling and administrative costs of Agility including $250,000 of one time restructuring and integration
costs, new hire costs in MediaMiser and $150,000 of one-time legal and other expenses for the Agility acquisition. Selling and
administrative expenses for the MIS segment as a percentage of MIS segment revenues declined to 66% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from 70% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decline reflects that the cost structure of Agility
relative to revenues is lower than the cost structure of MediaMiser. 

Contingent Consideration  

On September 30, 2016
we and the other parties to the transaction in which we acquired MediaMiser amended the terms on which one of our subsidiaries
is required to make a supplemental purchase price payment for MediaMiser. Prior to the amendment, the amount of the supplemental
purchase price payment was to be determined by the achievement of certain financial thresholds and was in no event to exceed $3.8
million (C$5 million). The amendment fixed the amount of the supplemental purchase price payment at $1.5 million (C$2 million)
payable in two equal installments on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 to designated recipients, except that no payments will
be made to designated recipients who fail to satisfy specified conditions. We have the option to pay up to 70% of the supplemental
amount in shares of Innodata Inc. stock. We recorded a $1.0 million charge in our statement of operations for the third quarter
of 2016 to reflect the amendment. 

Income Taxes  

For
the nine months ended  September 30, 2016,  we recorded a provision
for income taxes of $1.1 million in accordance with local tax regulations for our foreign subsidiaries.  Taxes primarily
consist of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective
income tax rates are disproportionate due to losses incurred by our U.S. entity and our Canadian subsidiary and a valuation allowance
recorded on deferred taxes on these entities. Some of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax holidays or preferential tax
rates which reduce our overall effective tax rate when compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. In addition, the earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries are not subject to tax in the U.S. unless the earnings are repatriated. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million. The provision for income taxes recorded by our foreign
subsidiaries was partially offset by a reversal of a tax provision on account of a favorable outcome in two of the tax proceedings
of our Indian subsidiary. 

We have a valuation allowance
on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of our MediaMiser subsidiary on account of continuing losses. 

Net Loss  

We generated a net loss
of $4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared
to a net loss of $2.2 million during the nine months ended  September
30, 2015 . 

Net loss for the DDS segment
was $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $1.5 million for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2015 , net of intersegment profits. Increased revenues
were partially offset by an increase in direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses that were mentioned above,
and to the charge to our operations referred to under  Contingent Consideration.  The change was also caused by an
increase in tax expense. 

Net loss for the IADS
segment was $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.8 million for the nine months ended  September
30, 2015 , net of intersegment profits. The decline in net loss is primarily due to an increase in revenues. 

Net loss for the MIS segment
was $1.1 million and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increased loss was
due to one-time integration expenses and acquisition-related costs.   

Adjusted EBITDA  

Adjusted EBITDA for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.3 million compared to income of $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, a decline of $0.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was $2.5 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $1.8 million or approximately 40%. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.6
million and a loss of $2.8 million for the IADS segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted
EBITDA was a loss of $0.6 million compared to a loss of $0.4 million for the MIS segment for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Selected measures of liquidity
and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: 

At September 30, 2016,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.3 million, of which $15.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries located in Asia
and $1.6 million was held in the United States. If needed, amounts held by foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to the United
States to satisfy working capital needs of the U.S. entity, but under current law, such amounts would be subject to United States
federal income taxes. As of September 30, 2016, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States, except
for $6.0 million in projected deemed dividends described below. 

We have
used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) investments in IADS which are expected to be at the rate of $0.5-$0.7
million per quarter in the immediate future; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) general corporate purposes, including
working capital; and (iv) possible business acquisitions. As of September 30, 2016, we had working capital of approximately $15.5
million, as compared to working capital of approximately $25.0 million as of December 31, 2015.  

We believe that our existing cash
and cash equivalents and internally generated funds will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs
for the next 12 months. However, we may curtail or lessen our continuing investments in our IADS segment and other segments, or
reduce our operating expenses, if these funds are insufficient and outside financing is not available on terms we find attractive. 

On July 14, 2016, our
MediaMiser subsidiary completed the acquisition of Agility from PR Newswire under an asset purchase agreement for a cash consideration
of $4.1 million. 

In the third quarter of
2016, our U.S. entity deferred $3.8 million in payments due to its Asian operating subsidiaries. The deferral in payments resulted
in a deemed dividend that is taxable income to the U.S. entity and is set off against its net operating loss carryforwards. We
project that during the period from October 1, 2016 through 2018 our U.S. entity may not have sufficient cash to pay in full amounts
that will be payable by it to its Asian operating subsidiaries and that the cash deficit will amount to approximately $2.4 million.
The resulting deferral in payments would similarly result in a deemed dividend that would be taxable income to the U.S. entity
and would be set off against its net operating loss carryforwards. 

In October 2015, we filed
a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which will give us the ability to offer, from time to time, up to an aggregate of
$70 million of securities, subject to market cap limitations, which may consist of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities,
warrants, or units consisting of any of the foregoing. The registration is intended to give us flexibility should financing opportunities
arise. 

Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating
Activities  

Cash used in our operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.1 million, resulting from a net loss of $4.9 million and adjustments
for non-cash items of $3.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.2 million for depreciation and amortization,
change in fair value of contingent consideration of $1.0 million, stock option expense of $0.7 million and reduction in tax provisions
of $0.3 million. 

Cash provided by our operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $2.3 million, resulting from a net loss of $2.6 million, adjustments
for non-cash items of $3.1 million, and $1.8 million provided by working capital changes. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily
consisted of $2.1 million for depreciation and amortization and stock option expense of $0.8 million. Working capital activities
primarily consisted of a source of cash of $1.2 million as a result of net collections of accounts receivable and a source of
cash of $0.6 million for a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits. 

Our days  sales
outstanding (DSO) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately 56 days as compared to 61 days for the year
ended December 31, 2015. We calculate DSO for a reported period by first dividing the total revenues for the period by the average
net accounts receivable for the period (which is the sum of the net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and the
net accounts receivable at the end of the period, divided by two), to yield an amount we refer to as the  accounts receivable
turnover.  Then we divide the total number of days within the reported period by the accounts receivable turnover to yield
DSO expressed in number of days. 

Net Cash Used In Investing Activities  

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, cash used in our investing activities was $6.1 million. These expenditures consisted of $4.1 million paid
to acquire Agility in July 2016 and capital expenditures of $2.0 million principally for the purchase of technology equipment
including servers, network infrastructure and workstations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in our investing
activities for capital expenditures was $0.5 million. We continue to expense all capital expenditures for the IADS segment. During
the next twelve months, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment, infrastructure upgrades and
development of our proprietary software platform, tools and technologies will approximate $2.0 to $3.0 million, a portion
of which we may finance. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used in financing activities were comprised of total payments of long-term obligations of $0.6
million and $0.9 million. 

Contractual Obligations  

The table below summarizes
our contractual obligations (in thousands) at September 30, 2016 and the effects that those obligations are expected to have on
our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. 

Future expected obligations
under our pension benefit plan have not been included in the contractual cash obligations in the table above. 

Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic
Conditions  

Our most significant costs
are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to higher inflation in wage rates in the countries
in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts
or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to
our clients. 

Our quarterly operating
results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new
projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors
may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities
are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. 

Our Synodex subsidiary
experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically volume declines in the third quarter of the calendar year whereas the
fourth quarter volumes are generally higher than other calendar quarters. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of
life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis
of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements which
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments,
long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, value of securities underlying stock-based compensation,
litigation accruals, pension benefits, purchase price allocation of Agility, valuation of derivative instruments and estimated
accruals for various tax exposures. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates
and could have a significant, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For a discussion of our critical
accounting policies see Part II, Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes
to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB
issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This update is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires
a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration
it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes
in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective
prospectively for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2017,
and early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of 2017. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective
approach to adopt the new standard when it takes effect. We have not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of this
standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the
FASB issued guidance related to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This new guidance requires that deferred tax assets
and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The new standard is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We
do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset,
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater
than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition
approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  This new standard is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted. We have not yet determined
the potential effects of the adoption of this standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued guidance relating to share-based compensation. This new guidance is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
Early application is permitted. We do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

Interest rate risk  

Our equipment sales leaseback
financing and capital lease transaction carries a fixed interest rate. Thus, as of September 30, 2016 we are not exposed to any
market risk due to interest rate fluctuations. 

Foreign currency risk   

Although the majority
of our revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, pound
sterling and euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri
Lanka, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and Israel, is incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For
financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. 

To mitigate the exposure
of fluctuating future cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts.
These foreign currency forward contracts were entered into with a maximum term of twelve months and have an aggregate notional
amount of approximately $17.7 million as of September 30, 2016. The total unrealized gain on the outstanding hedges was $0.1 million
as of September 30, 2016. 

The impact of foreign
currency fluctuations will continue to present economic challenges to us and could negatively impact our overall results of operations.
A 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar s value relating to hedged currencies would decrease the forward contracts 
fair value by approximately $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016. Similarly, a 10% depreciation in the U.S. dollar s value
relative to hedged currencies would increase the forward contracts  fair value by approximately $2.0 million. Any increase
or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange-rate-sensitive forward contracts, if utilized, would be substantially offset
by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying cash flows. 

We may continue to enter
into these, or other such instruments, in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the
value of these foreign currencies. 

Other than the aforementioned
forward contracts, we have not engaged in any hedging activities nor have we entered into off-balance-sheet transactions or arrangements.
In addition, as of September 30, 2016, our foreign locations held cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $15.7 million.
These assets are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. At present, we do not enter
into any hedging instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk on such assets; however, we may do so in the future. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period
covered by this report, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

There have been no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the
fiscal quarter to which this report relates, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

In response to the Audit
Committee investigation described under  Recent Development  in Item 2 of this Report, the Company intends to conduct
supplemental employee training relating to the subject areas of the investigation. 

PART II.            OTHER
INFORMATION   

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  

There were no material changes from the legal
proceedings previously disclosed in Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors  

The matter set forth under  Recent Development 
in Item 2 of this Report is a risk factor that is in addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

We purchased 57,000 shares of our common stock, for a total cost
of approximately $0.1 million, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as shown in the table below:  

In September 2011, our Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of our common stock in open market or private transactions. There
is no expiration date associated with the program. 

On July 28, 2016 we
issued 236,000 shares of Innodata Inc. common stock as a portion of the purchase price consideration for the acquisition of
MediaMiser. The issuance was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to section 4(a)(2)
thereof.
