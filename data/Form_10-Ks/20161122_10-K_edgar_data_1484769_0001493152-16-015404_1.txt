1.     BUSINESS  

Overview  

We
are an award-winning feature film and television specials production company. We seek to finance, produce and distribute one or
more television series and feature films to be licensed for exploitation in domestic and international theatrical, television,
cable, home video and pay per view markets.  

Through
our subsidiary that we acquired in December 2013, High Five Entertainment, we specialize in the development and presentation of
quality television programming including live events and award shows.  

Through
our subsidiary that we acquired in July 2016, Recall Studios, we focus on Virtual Reality content, filling the demand attendant
to the increased production of virtual reality viewing devices absent a corresponding increase in content production.  

Corporate
History Summary  

We
were incorporated on February 20, 2009, in the State of Florida, under the name York Entertainment, Inc. On October 5, 2010, we
amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Brick Top Productions, Inc. Effective December 31, 2014, we amended
our articles of incorporation to change our name to Carolco Pictures, Inc. For a complete history of our operations since we were
incorporated in February 2009, please refer to our reports and documents filed with SEC at www.sec.gov.

Carolco

non-linear consumer based editing software.

our recent acquisition of Recall Studios, Carolco Pictures creates virtual reality content and is developing non-linear consumer
based editing software.

September, 2014 we acquired intellectual property rights in relation to the trademarked Carolco Pictures, a name synonymous with
high quality blockbuster films from the Terminator series, Rambo series and Basic Instinct to Total Recall and the Doors, amongst
many others, as described herein. The Company believes it will successfully leverage the name that brought the public such noteworthy
films and capitalize on this acquisition. We are actively seeking to acquire the rights to the concomitant service mark and believe
we will do so within the next 90-120 days.

The
Company   

Film
Production   

The
Filmmaking Process . The filmmaking process starts with an idea, from freelance writers or from existing literary or other
works. Successful ideas are generally written up as a treatment (or story description) and then proceed to a screenplay, followed
by the storyboarding process and then finally into the production process. Excluding the script and early development phase, the
production process, from storyboarding to filming out the final image, for a full-length feature film can take approximately two
to four years. We outsource individuals that are responsible for preparing and offering story-lines and ideas for the initial
stages of development. These individuals, through creative development controls, are responsible for ensuring that ideas follow
the best creative path within a desired budget and schedule. The complexity of each project, the background locations, the characters
and all of the elements in a project create a very intricate and time-consuming process that differs from project-to-project.
The four general phases for development of a full-length feature film include (1) the development phase which consists of story
and visual development, (2) the pre-production phase which involves final refinement of the script and story, (3) the production
phase which involves the actual filming and (4) the post-production phase where elements such as sound effects and the music/score
are added.

our subsidiary High Five Entertainment, we specialize in the development and presentation of quality television programming including
specials, pilots, live events and award shows. Founded in Los Angeles, California in 1983, High Five Entertainment s unwavering

High
Five Entertainment, produced television s first ever live musical performances weaved throughout a previously recorded network
television premiere. On September 24, 2014, in connection with ABC s  Nashville  premieres on both the East Coast and
West Coast, High Five Entertainment mixed fantasy and reality as it brought together the  Nashville  stars with actual country
music legends, broadcasting two concerts directly from the Bluebird Caf  set. Receiving real life acclaim for the innovation
and quality, High Five Entertainment continues its ground breaking work. The progressive mixture of live and taped footage comes
immediately after High Five Entertainment produced the Americana Music Honors   Awards, another in a series of well received
accomplishments.  

High
Five Entertainment again produced the Country Music Awards Red Carpet event for the CMT network, leading in to the 48th Annual
CMA Awards. We believe High Five Entertainment will continue to produce its ground breaking and well received programming in the
immediate future.  

In
September 2014, we acquired intellectual property rights in relation to the trademarked Carolco Pictures. The Company believes
it will successfully leverage the name that brought the public noteworthy films such as the Terminator series, the Rambo Series,
Basic Instinct, Total Recall and The Doors, and capitalize on this acquisition. We have been awarded intellectual property rights
to the concomitant service mark for use in the United States.  

High
Five Entertainment   

As
briefly described above, High Five Entertainment is an internationally recognized, Emmy Award-winning entertainment production
company based in Nashville, Tennessee specializing in the development and presentation of quality television programming including
series, specials, pilots, live events and award shows.  

Founded
in Los Angeles, California in 1983, High Five s unwavering commitment to excellence in entertainment production for more
than 30 years continues to foster an impressive legacy of unsurpassed client satisfaction through collaborative creative development,
meticulous planning and flawless delivery of world-class entertainment properties.  

Relocating
to Nashville in the early nineties, High Five Entertainment became synonymous with the presentation of groundbreaking music television
events ( The Women of Country  CBS,  This Is Garth Brooks  NBC,  At the Ryman  CMT and  The
Road  Tribune Entertainment). Today, High Five continues to be one of the premiere producers of quality music-television
entertainment with ongoing episodes of Opry Live quality music-television entertainment with ongoing episodes of synonymous with
the presentation of groundbreaking music television events.  

High
Five made an extremely successful foray into the fascinating world of motorsports entertainment, producing SPEED Channel s
(soon to be Fox Sports One) top-rated series tPass Time , a riveting, fast-paced game show for gear heads. HFE produced
more than 150 episodes of the show. Also for SPEED Channel, High Five produced two seasons the popular unscripted series  Drag
Race High  pitting two area high school motor-shop classes in direct head to head competition building and racing their
own dragsters. HFE followed this with the series  Burnout  The Ultimate Drag Race Challenge  in Phoenix, AZ
which aired on MTV2. HFE also recently produced a record-breaking PBS pledge special with Dr. Daniel Amen, iChange Your Brain,
Change Your Life , and the follow-up special  A Magnificent Mind At Any Age .  

Recall
Studios   

On
July 21, 2016, we acquired Recall studios. Founded by business, media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand
for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) content, Recall Studios operates within the convergence of immersive content
and software. Recall Studios will allow consumers to create and share interactive experiences across all platforms.  Combining
modern business strategy with industry experience by bringing together highly trained relative newcomers and entertainment industry
stalwarts to create low risk, high profit and artistically acclaimed feature film virtual reality and television projects, the
Company and its subsidiaries are analyzing profitability across myriad entertainment sectors. We believe that Recall Studios is
the future of new media entertainment and technology.   

New
Media is a multi-billion-dollar industry even in its nascent form. Demand for VR and mixed media content is growing rapidly.  

Experienced
at developing immersive narratives and software, we believe that Recall s team is positioned to capitalize on the absence
of high quality consumer VR experiences and software. No company has emerged as the leader in either VR production or technologies
that allow consumers to edit, create, and distribute interactive VR content. Recall s competition is limited as we do not
believe that there are any companies actively providing non-linear, interactive VR software/platform solutions for consumers.  

Management  

The
business side of our management team is disciplined in financial risk mitigation techniques. Aside from the commercialization
of our management team s past successes, which cannot in themselves necessarily predict future success, we are experienced
at balancing projects, budgets and growth to effectively manage risk in light of our business objectives.  

We
believe that we have unique access to Hollywood talent, scripts and third parties ripe for acquisition. We believe that the reputation
of our management team in producing some of the most-well known, talked about and socially ingrained entertainment opens doors
for us that are closed to others.  

We
believe we represent a new model in entertainment industry profitability. We intend to focus on growth and efficiency. Our development
plan combines modern business strategy with old-fashioned industry experience. Our early acquisition, High Five Entertainment,
has given us highly regarded, industry leading talent. We have matched that talent with new and existing property development.
By targeting additional revenue positive entertainment projects and companies, we expect to achieve increased profitability and
efficiency through scale.  

Competition

We
believe that our management team s reputation, contacts and experience give us a competitive edge. However, the market for
productions currently is, and is expected to continue to be, extremely competitive. Our competitors include many companies that
have substantially greater financial, management, marketing resources and experience than us. There can be no assurance that our
productions will be competitive with other motion pictures or television shows, or that we will be able to achieve or maintain
profitability.

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014  

Revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $964,000 as compared to $790,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase
in revenue was due to an increase in demand for the Company s production services, particularly in area of award presentation
programming. The Company continues to focus much of its efforts in the area of productions related to televised awards programming
where it believes it has the expertise to grow in this sector. Revenue recognition is deferred until product is delivered and
accepted by our customers. Our future revenue plan is, in part, dependent on our ability to effectively market The Doorman pilot
and close new viable acquisitions of film rights.  

Cost
of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $792,000 as compared to $631,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
This increase was attributable in part to a 25% increase in revenues and primarily to increases in production labor as the Company
increased staff in anticipation of future planned production projects.  

Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were relatively constant at $3,218,000 compared to $2,500,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees of $190,000, and an increase in general
and administrative expenses of $73,000 and impairment of goodwill of $319,000. These increases were primarily offset by a decrease
in compensation expenses of $263,000.  

The
Company has realized a net loss of $7,609,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $2,276,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net loss of approximately $5,333,000 is primarily due to the change in fair value
to derivatives of $2,263,000, loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,500,000, and an impairment of goodwill of $319,000.  

Liquidity

of $2,677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

As
part of the Company s acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc. (doing business as High Five Entertainment), the Company entered
into an Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Martin Fischer, pursuant to which Mr. Fischer will serve as High Five s
president for an initial term of five years with an initial base salary of $144,000. He will also be entitled to an annual bonus
of up to $100,000 and a monthly car allowance of $500. In addition, the Company awarded Mr. Fischer an option to purchase 1,491,351
shares of common stock, these options vest throughout 2014.  

We
have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining
profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have raised additional capital through equity
offerings and loan transactions, and, in the short term, will seek to raise additional capital in such manners to fund our operations.
We do not currently have any third-party financing available in the form of loans, advances, or commitments. Our officers and
shareholders have not made any written or oral agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to continue to raise capital on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As
of December 31, 2015, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Going
Concern  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a stockholders  deficit at December 31,
2015, incurred a net loss and used cash in operating activities for the year then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support
its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise
additional funds.  

In
addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s December 31,
2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies  

Our
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on
an on-going basis, our estimates and judgments, including those related to the useful life of the assets. We base our estimates
on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

The
methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results
that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity s most critical accounting policies
to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations
and those that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation. For a more detailed discussion of the accounting
policies of the Company, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies .  

We
believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements.  

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include depreciable lives of property and equipment,
analysis of impairments of recorded goodwill, accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing derivative liabilities
and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as
compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants
issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at
the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants granted to non-employees
are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options
and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already
recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements
by the non-employee, option and warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded
in the period of the measurement date.  

The
fair value of the Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options
or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a probability weighted average
Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates through the December
31, 2015, reporting date.  

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting period.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

See
Note 2 in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements  

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012  

The
JOBS Act permits an  emerging growth company  such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply
with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected
to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an  emerging growth company. 
This election will permit us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that will have different effective dates
for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Consequently, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

None.  

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.  

On
March 28, 2016, the Company dismissed its independent registered public accounting firm, Li   Company, P.C. ( LICO ).
The decision to change the independent registered public accounting firm was recommended and approved by the Board of Directors
of the Company. On March 28, 2016, the Company engaged Weinberg   Company, P.A., as its independent registered audit firm
to audit the Registrant s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and to perform procedures related
to the financial statements included in the Company s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, beginning with the quarter ended March
31, 2016.  

Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We
carried out an evaluation as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31,
2015. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015.  

Report
of Management on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.  

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, utilizing the framework established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, was not effective, primarily as a result of the fact that the
Company has few employees, only one of whom has a background in accounting, and lacks segregation of duties.  

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the inherent
limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.  

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our current executive officers and directors.  

David
Cohen . Mr. Cohen was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company in June 2016. Prior to joining the
Company, Mr. Cohen was a Director of Investment Banking at Newbridge Securities Corporation from January 2015 through January
2016, and was the Director of Investment at National Securities Corp from June 2013 through December 2014, where he led the underwriting
efforts for myriad NASDAQ and NYSE listed public companies. Prior to working with these investment banks, Mr. Cohen founded a
private equity firm, Beachwood Capital LLC since January 2011 based in North Palm Beach, Florida. That Firm s successful
philosophy focused on achieving high compounding risk-adjusted returns through investments in securities approaching an inflection
point as informed by proprietary macro and microeconomic analyses. Those investments included public equity and debt securities,
equity derivatives and select direct investments in private companies. The firm deployed capital through multi-year investments
with innovative companies that were both under followed by research analysts and inefficiently priced by the investment community.
Preceding his ownership in the aforementioned private equity firm, Mr. Cohen was the Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer
and Director of a publicly traded company. During his leadership, Mr. Cohen executed a successful roll-up strategy within his
industry, oversaw day-to-day management, led mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, employed junior management to oversee 40
employees and provided an informed voice to the Wall Street investment community. His 20 years of expertise in the securities
markets includes all facets of public company management, corporate finance and corporate consulting for publicly-traded companies.
As an advisor for various investment banking firms and brokerages, Mr. Cohen has specialized in the small and lower-middle market
sectors, arranging financings in the public and private equity markets for emerging companies in a variety of industries. Mr.
Cohen holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Pace University in New York City.  

Alexander
Bafer  .  Mr. Bafer is our Chief Development Officer, a Director and Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Company. Mr. Bafer is a seasoned executive and an established entrepreneur, having generated tens of
millions of dollars in revenue for companies during his career. Mr. Bafer has successfully led the organization and development
of numerous startup companies, and achieved many successful exits. The Company is the latest success story for Mr. Bafer. During
the 5 years under his direction, the Company (formerly known as Brick Top Productions) went public, acquired an Emmy award-winning
production company that was generating substantial revenue, and acquired the rights to the name and service mark of  Carolco
Pictures , which belonged to a now defunct but famous Academy Award winning studio behind blockbuster films Terminator 2
  3, The Rambo Series, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct, just to name a few of the 36 films produced by the famous studio
that earned it 16 Academy Award nominations and 6 Academy Award wins. Mr. Bafer s vision was to rebrand the Company as the
new  Carolco Pictures  and reunite the powerhouse name with the famous studio s original founder and CEO, Mario
Kassar. Mr. Bafer was successful, bringing Mr. Kassar on board as the Company s Chief Development Executive and also as
Chairman of the Board from February 2015 through January 2016. This ultimately resulted in the October 2015 sale of Mr. Bafer s
majority interest of the Company for a significant multiple. When new management of the Company asked him to come back to assist
in leading the Company back to prominence, Mr. Bafer agreed. Prior to his work with the Company, Mr. Bafer was an equity partner
with Guaranteed Mortgage Bankers, where he was responsible for managing and training 75 sales agents throughout 6 multi state
offices. During his 4-year tenure at Guaranteed Mortgage, before selling his equity interest, his efforts resulted in a cumulative
revenue increase for the company of more than 300%. Mr. Bafer s business management and financial acumen were apparent even
early on in his career and have permeated throughout it ever since. After graduating in the top 4% of his St. John s University
class, Mr. Bafer moved on to help manage a $500 million portfolio at Merrill Lynch in New York City. He then assumed a position
as senior account executive with Preferred Securities Group in Boca Raton, Florida, where he was quickly promoted to President
and Managing Director responsible for overseeing the firm s three trading offices, 50 registered representatives and numerous
support personnel. From there he accepted an equity position as a fund manager where he was involved in all aspects of building,
organizing and managing a hedge fund. Throughout his career, Mr. Bafer has been involved with Investment Management of America,
a venture capital firm and incubator, where he has been instrumental in raising capital for numerous prominent start-up ventures.
Mr. Bafer has proven to be a successful asset to the management and support teams of several startups and continues to utilize
his successes and proven experience in business development to assist others in organizing and developing their business s
from any stage, whether it be a startup or a developed company in need of capital, expansion, guidance or ultimately an exit.   

Bradley
Albert.  Mr. Albert   was appointed as President,
Chief Creative Officer, and a Director of the Company in June 2016  Prior to joining Recall
Studios, Mr. Albert served as President of Synapps since 2010. He led his team to become the first VR company to film a US President
in virtual reality and premiered a groundbreaking VR experience at 2016 s TriBeCA Film Festival. Mr. Albert was a marketing
executive for over a decade and has developed strategies for some of the most successful companies in the world including Proctor
  Gamble, Tyson Foods, Kia and Puma. From Lotus to Ludacris he helped shape the language of modern brand identity. In 2008,
Brad founded SynApps Media at the inception of the Mobile App boom and created award winning UI/UX experiences across all mobile
platforms. He also worked as an executive producer at Roadside Entertainment where he was a producer for the ESPY awards and a
multitude of commercials and documentaries. Mr. Albert graduated with a degree in Organizational Behavior and Management from
Brown University.   

Justin
Morris.  Mr. Morris has served as our Chief Operating Officer and a Director of the Company since June 2016 Prior to joining
Recall Studios, Mr. Morris served as Chief Executive Officer of Synapps since 2010. Mr. Morris is a technology and multi-media
veteran with a unique insight into the obstacles facing Virtual Reality and media convergence today. Over the course of his career,
Mr. Morris has directed and produced content for industry giants FOX, NBC, The Discovery Channel, SPIKE and E!. He has designed
user experiences for a wide range of mediums including immersive content, mobile games, apps and websites. Prior to joining Recall
Studios, Mr. Morris served as CEO of SynappsVR, a next generation content company that has pioneered the Virtual Reality landscape.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Morris joined FTI Consulting where he helped facilitate deals and restructure over $40 billion of assets
for various clients including GM, Lehman Brothers Creditors, the Government of Ireland, TD Bank and Citi. Seeking to broaden his
horizons, he founded SynApps Media, a mobile app development firm that worked with clients ranging from AXA insurance to the WNBA s
Washington Mystics. Mr. Morris holds a degree in computer science from Brown University where he worked with the school s
Virtual Reality Lab called The Cave. Mr. Morris also holds a Masters degree in Real Estate Finance from NYU.     

Background
and Qualifications of Directors.  

When
considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable
the Board of Directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of the Company s business and structure,
the Board of Directors focuses primarily on each person s background and experience as reflected in the information discussed
in each of the directors  individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix
of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. As more specifically described in the biographies set
forth above, our directors possess relevant knowledge and experience in the finance, accounting and business fields generally,
which we believe enhances the Board s ability to oversee, evaluate and direct our overall corporate strategy.  

Committees
of our Board of Directors    

Our
securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our board members be independent and we are
not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our board of directors include
 independent  directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or other committee of our
board of directors.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company had the following Committees of our Board of Directors:  

1.  
      Nomination
    Committee    

Alexander
                                         Bafer, Chairman

                                         Bafer, Chairman  
          Frank
        Esposito    

Our
board currently consists of Messrs. Bafer (Chair), Cohen, Albert and Morris. We do not currently have any board committees.  

Candidates
for director nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the board and the Company s operating requirements
and the long-term interests of its stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Board of Directors considers skills, diversity,
age, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the board and the Company, to maintain a balance
of knowledge, experience and capability.  

The
board s process for identifying and evaluating nominees for director, including nominees recommended by stockholders, will
involve compiling names of potentially eligible candidates, conducting background and reference checks, conducting interviews
with the candidate and others (as schedules permit), meeting to consider and approve the final candidates and, as appropriate,
preparing an analysis with regard to particular recommended candidates.  

Through
their own business activities and experiences each of directors have come to understand that in today s business environment,
development of useful products and identification of undervalued real estate, along with other related efforts, are the keys to
building our company. The directors will seek out individuals with relevant experience to operate and build our current and proposed
business activities.  

Director
Compensation    

In
2015, we granted each of our then-non-employee directors (Messrs. Goodman, Ortiz and Leitch) and Mr. Esposito 50,000 shares of
our unregistered common stock and agreed to issue each of these directors an additional 50,000 shares on each anniversary of their
appointment as compensation for their services as a director of our company. Certain directors who were employees during 2015
(Messrs. Bafer and Fischer) are not paid for board service in addition to their regular compensation.  

As
compensation for serving as our Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2015, we granted Mr. Kassar 500,000 shares of our unregistered
shares of common stock and the option to purchase all or any part of 400,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00
per share, exercisable until 10 years after the effective date of his appointment. We also assumed an obligation to pay Mr. Kassar
$300,000, as amended, to cover taxes with respect to compensation paid to him as Chairman. In addition, we agreed to reimburse
Mr. Kassar for all business expenses incurred or paid by him in the performance of his duties on behalf of the Company including,
without limitation, all required travel and lodging expenses. We also agreed to indemnify Mr. Kassar against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, expenses (including outside attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by Mr. Kassar
in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), including
any action by or in the right of the Company, by reason of any act or omission to act in connection with the performance of his
duties under the agreement to the fullest extent that we are permitted to indemnify him under our Articles of Incorporation in
effect as of the date of his appointment and applicable law. During the term of this agreement, we are required to obtain and
maintain Directors and Officers Insurance in a form acceptable to Mr. Kassar naming him as an additional named insured. Further,
provided that Mr. Kassar has neither voluntarily resigned nor been terminated under the terms of the agreement, the majority shareholders
who are a party to the agreement agreed to vote all their shares in the Company over which they have voting control and agreed
to promptly take all other necessary or desirable actions within their control (including in their capacity as shareholder, director,
member of a board committee or officer of the Company or otherwise, and whether at a regular or special meeting or by written
consent in lieu of a meeting) to reelect Mr. Kassar as Chairman of Board of the Company.  

In
addition, we entered into an Executive Services Agreement with Mr. Kassar, subject to a condition precedent, to become our Chief
Development Executive. As the Chief Development Executive, Mr. Kassar will render non-exclusive services to us in providing advice
on any film projects that we acquire or are considering acquiring. The agreement will become effective when we obtain, no later
than March 30, 2015, at least $4 million of equity investment (on terms approved by Mr. Kassar) for a project currently titled
 Audition.   

Effective
as of July 14, 2014, we agreed to pay Frank Esposito s law firm a base retainer of $5,000 per month for legal services provided
to us. Mr. Esposito ceased to be a member of our board of directors in October 2015.  

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934    

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our
common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors
and greater than 10% beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file.  

Based
solely upon our review of copies of such forms received by us, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
the following persons did not timely file Forms 3, Forms 4 and Forms 5 reporting beneficial ownership of our securities and/or
changes therein: each of Messrs. Bafer, Esposito, Leitch, Kassar and Goodman failed to file timely his Form 3, and Mr. Bafer failed
to file timely one Form 4 with respect to one transaction and one Form 4 with respect to seven transactions.

Compensation Table  

The
table below summarizes all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to each named executive officer for our last two completed
fiscal years for all services rendered to us.  

Employment
Agreements  

On
July 25, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Alexander Bafer under which he agreed to serve as our Chairman of
the Board, and Chief Development Officer. The agreement provides for a base salary of $0 per year and a will be eligible to receive
a bonus, payable in Employer s sole discretion. The amount of Executive s compensation shall be reviewed periodically,
and at minimum shall be reviewed annually. It may be increased at the sole discretion of the Board or its Compensation Committee,
if any, provided, however, that, consistent with the renewal provisions contained in Article 1.1,  supra , such compensation
shall, after the initial Term, be placed before the Board or the Compensation Committee, if any, for a requested increase to cover
cost of living expenses upon subsequent renewals of this Agreement. Employer shall provide Executive with standard benefits ordinarily
granted to an executive in Executive s position and ordinarily associated with the custom and practice of the industry,
if any. Employer shall pay, or reimburse Executive, for all ordinary, reasonable and necessary expenses which Executive incurs
in performing Executive s duties under this Agreement including, but not limited to, travel, entertainment, professional
dues and subscriptions, and all dues, fees and expenses associated with membership in various professional, business and civic
associations and societies of which Executive s participation is in the best interest of Employer. While employed by Employer,
Executive shall be allowed to participate, on the same basis generally as other Executives of Employer, in all general Executive
benefit plans and programs, Executive s employment with Employer shall be terminated (i) upon the death of Executive; (ii)
for Cause, as defined in Section 3.3; or (iii) upon Executive s permanent disability (permanent disability being defined
as Executive s physical or mental incapacity to perform his usual duties as an Executive with such condition likely to remain
continuously for more than three months, provided, however, that in such event, Executive s employment shall be continued
hereunder for a period of not less than one year from the date of such disability, but not beyond the end of the Term, with Executive s
base salary during such period to be reduced by any Employer-financed disability benefits. If Executive s employment is
terminated by reason of the death of Executive or permanent disability of Executive (as defined in Section 3.1), all future compensation
to which Executive is otherwise entitled and all future benefits for which Executive is eligible shall become due and payable
as of the date of termination. Executive, or his estate in the case of Executive s death, shall be entitled to Executive s
pro rata salary through the date of such termination and shall be entitled to any individual bonuses or individual incentive compensation
not yet paid but due under Employer s plans but shall not be entitled to any other payments by or on behalf of Employer
except for those which may be payable pursuant to the terms of Employer s Executive benefit plans or by virtue of Executive s
ownership of Employer s stock which shall remain unaffected by the termination of Executive s employment. The Company
shall have the right to terminate Executive s employment under this Agreement at any time for Cause, which termination shall
be effective immediately. As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to be paid to Executive hereunder, and
as an additional incentive for Employer to enter into this Agreement, Employer and Executive agree to the non-competition provisions
of this Article 5. Executive agrees that during the period of Executive s non-competition obligations hereunder (twelve
months), Executive will not, directly or indirectly for Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where Employer
or any of their affiliated companies are conducting any business (other than de minimis business operations) as of the date of
termination of the employment relationship or have during the previous twelve months conducted any business (other than de minimis
business operations): (i) engage in any business directly competitive with any business (other than de minimis business operations)
conducted by Employer or any of Employer s affiliates; (ii) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other
person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business directly competitive with any business(other
than de minimis business operations) conducted by Employer or any of Employer s affiliates; or (iii) induce any Executive
of Employer or any of its affiliates (other than Executive s personal secretary or administrative assistant) to terminate
his employment with Employer, or its affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such induced Executive by any person,
association, or entity not affiliated with Employer. These non-competition obligations shall extend until two years after termination
of the employment relationship between Employer and Executive.  

On
July 25, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Bradly Albert under which he agreed to serve as our President, Chief
Creative Officer, and Director. The employment agreement provides for a one year term, which automatically renews unless the other
party gives a termination notice. The agreement provides for a base salary of $65,000 per year. Executive s employment with
Employer shall be terminated (i) upon the death of Executive; (ii) for Cause, as defined in Section 3.3; or (iii) upon Executive s
permanent disability (permanent disability being defined as Executive s physical or mental incapacity to perform his usual
duties as an Executive with such condition likely to remain continuously for more than three months. As part of the consideration
for the compensation and benefits to be paid to Executive hereunder, and as an additional incentive for Employer to enter into
this Agreement, Employer and Executive agree to the non-competition provisions of this Article 5. Executive agrees that during
the period of Executive s non-competition obligations hereunder (twelve months), Executive will not, directly or indirectly

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

  Carolco
Pictures Inc.  

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Carolco Pictures Inc. (the  Company ) as of December
31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity (deficit) and cash flows for
the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amount and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of their operations and their cash flows
for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a stockholders  deficit at December 31,
2015 and incurred a net loss and used cash in operating activities for the year then ended which raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described
in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note
1 - Organization and Operations   

Carolco
Pictures, Inc. (formerly  Brick Top Productions, Inc.  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Florida on in February 2009 under the name  York Entertainment, Inc.  The Company changed its name
to Brick Top Productions, Inc. in October 2010. In January 2015, the Company changed its name from Brick Top Productions, Inc.
to Carolco Pictures, Inc. In addition, in January 2015, the Company changed its stock symbol from  BTOP  to  CRCO.   

Going
Concern   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, and which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a stockholders  deficit of $5,371,359 at December
31, 2015, and incurred a net loss of $7,609,153, and utilized net cash used in operating activities $914,694 for the year then
ended. In addition, at December 31, 2015, $543,115 of convertible notes payable   related party matured and were in default
and as a result, $261,157 of convertible notes were also deemed in default due to a cross-default provision of the note. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Management
estimates that the current funds on hand and raising capital through proceeds from the sale of common stock subscriptions will
be sufficient to continue operations through the year ended December 31, 2016. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company raised approximately $416,000 through the issuance of 487,000 shares of common stock. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to execute its strategy and in its ability to raise additional
funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity securities for cash to operate
its business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms
that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions
on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in case or equity financing.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include depreciable lives of property and equipment,
analysis of impairments of recorded goodwill, accruals for potential liabilities, assumptions made in valuing derivative liabilities
and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
Company s consolidated subsidiaries and/or entities are as follows:  

The
accompanying financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries.
The consolidated accounts include 100% of the assets and liabilities of our majority owned subsidiaries, and the ownership interests
of minority investors are recorded as a minority interest. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described:  

Level
    1  
         
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
         
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3  
         
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, other assets, accounts payable and accrued
payroll, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of notes payable
and convertible notes approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on
prevailing market interest rates.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s derivative liability of $4,672,617 was based on Level 2 measurements.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking
into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful lives of five (5) years. Upon sale or
retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain
or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset,
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2014, the Company did not recognize any impairment for its property and equipment.  

Goodwill    

Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net assets at the date of acquisition. In accordance
with the guidance of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, goodwill acquired in a business combination with indefinite useful
lives is not amortized; rather, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate the asset might be impaired.  

As
part of our impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary, we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible
asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, as determined
by its discounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Based upon our impairment test
as of December 31, 2015, the Company determined that its recorded goodwill of $319,237 was entirely impaired.  

Concentrations    

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had four customers that accounted for 24%, 18%, 16% and 15% of sales respectively.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had three customers that accounted for 47%, 27%, and 19% of sales respectively.  

Non-Controlling
Interest    

The
Company follows paragraph 810-10-65-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report the non-controlling interest in
its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets within the equity section, separately from the Company s
stockholders  equity. Non-controlling interest represents the non-controlling interest holders  proportionate share
of the equity of the Company s majority-owned subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is adjusted for the non-controlling
interest holders  proportionate share of the earnings or losses and other comprehensive income (loss) and the non-controlling
interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest
balance.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company specializes in the development and presentation of quality television programming including series, specials, pilots,
live events and award shows. The Company recognizes revenue from its live events and award show productions when all of the following
criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the show or live event has been completed and occurred
and there are no future production obligations, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured.  

Revenues
from the sale of programming for television and other media will be recognized when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the show/episode is complete, and in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has
been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery; (iii) the price to the customer is fixed and determinable;
and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as
compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants
issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at
the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options and warrants granted to non-employees
are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options
and warrants vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already
recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements
by the non-employee, option and warrant grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded
in the period of the measurement date.  

The
fair value of the Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options
or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.  

Deposit
for Film Project to Related Party    

Deposit
for film project include capitalizable production costs, production overhead, interest, development costs and acquired production
costs and are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value. The amount by which the unamortized costs
of film and television productions exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Film development costs for projects that
have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off.  

Loss
Per Share    

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the Company. In computing diluted loss per share, the treasury stock
method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average
market price during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the
average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants.  

At
December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Company had 2,952,600 and 1,491,350 warrants outstanding, respectively, which were excluded from
the loss per share calculation as they were anti-dilutive.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments    

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a probability weighted average
Black-Scholes-Merton models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates through the December
31, 2015, reporting date.  

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting period.  

Income
Tax Provision    

The
Company follows the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right
of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02
is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified
retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after,
the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) : Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all income tax effects of awards be recognized
in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee s
shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election
to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related
disclosures.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.  

Note
3 - Acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc .  

S G
Holdings, Inc., doing business as High Five Entertainment ( S G ), was organized under the laws of the State of
Tennessee in January 2005. High Five Entertainment is an entertainment production company based in Nashville, Tennessee specializing
in the development and presentation of television programming including series, specials, pilots, live events and award shows.  

On
December 24, 2013, the Company acquired 75% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of S G for $235,000. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting by allocating the purchase price to the fair value of the
assets acquired, including intangible assets and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the liabilities assumed and the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The purchase
price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities as follows:  

At
December 31, 2015, the Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill, and determined that such goodwill was impaired,
and recognized an impairment expense of $319,237. The Company determined there were no such impairment at December 31, 2014 due
to the early stages of S G operations subsequent to the Company s acquisition.  

Note
4   Deposit for Film Project Paid to Related Party   

In
April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Mario Kassar, who at the time was the Chairman of the Company. Pursuant
to the agreement, the Company provided $250,000 in funding to a company managed by Mr. Kassar for the production of a film initially
titled  Audition   

Pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement, the Company engaged Mr. Kassar to render producing and sales services for each film in the  Rambo 
franchise,  SMITE  franchise or other feature length motion picture property introduced to the Company by Mr. Kassar
(each, a  Picture ) on the same terms as apply to  Audition,  except that the producing fee shall not
be less than 10% of the budget of each Picture. The Company also agreed to pay Mr. Kassar 5% of the purchase price of any Carolco-produced
feature length films in the  Rambo  franchise and all completed films or film libraries acquired by the Company with
Mr. Kassar s assistance and based on Mr. Kassar s introduction to the Company of such completed films or film libraries.
The terms of the Agreement also provide that the Company will pay Mr. Kassar a discretionary bonus in relation to his efforts
in bringing projects and opportunities to the Company.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the project was still in pre-production stage. The Company determined there were no such impairment of the
deposit at December 31, 2015 due to the early stages of the film production.

Note
6- Convertible Notes Payable in Default   

Convertible
notes payable consist of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:  

(a)
On May 6, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $91,242 to St. George Investments,
LLC (the  Lender ). The note bears interest at 10% per annum and matures eleven months from the effective date of
the agreement. Under the terms of the note, there was an original issue discount ( OID ) of $8,000 withheld at funding
and the Company agreed to pay $3,000 to the Lender to cover the Lender s legal fees and other transaction related costs.
The Company recognized the OID as a note discount and the $3,000 fee as debt issuance costs. Both the note discount and issuance
costs recognized in the transaction are being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. In addition, the Company
paid an $8,000 finders  fee in the transaction which has been recorded in debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest
expense of the life of the note. During the year, the Company paid $5,000 of the principal due, and $30,741 of principal was converted
into 6,527,297 shares of common stock, leaving a remaining balance due of $55,501 at December 31, 2015. The note is currently
past due and in default.  

The
note is convertible by the Lender into common stock of the Company at the lesser of $0.45 per share or, in the event the Company s
market capitalization falls below $15.0 million, at a defined Lender conversion price.  

(b) On
May 12, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $104,000 to the Vis Vires Group, Inc.
( VVG ). The note bears interest at 8% per annum, increased to 22% in the event of default, and matures February 14,
2016. VVG deducted $2,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal and other transaction related costs which was recorded as debt
issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. During the year, principal of $25,640 was
converted into 11,070,857 shares of common stock, leaving a remaining balance due of $78,360 at December 31, 2015. The note is
currently past due and in default.  

The
note is convertible by VVG into common stock of the Company through the later of the note maturity date or the payment of the
defined amount in the event of default. The note carries a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price (representing
a 39% discount), with market price being defined as the average of the lowest three trading days for the Company s common
stock during the 10 day period prior to the conversion date.  

(c) On
June 22, 2015, the company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $87,750 to the Auctus Fund, LLC ( Auctus ).
The note bears interest at 8% per annum, increased to 24% in the event of default, and matures on March 22, 2016. Auctus deducted
$8,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal and other transaction related costs which were recorded as debt issuance costs and
is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the note. In addition, the Company paid an $8,000 finders  fee in
this transaction which has been recorded in debt issuance costs and is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the
note. During the year, principal of $1,784 was converted into 4,460,325 shares of common stock, leaving a remaining balance due
of $85,966 at December 31, 2015. The note is currently past due and in default.  

The
note is convertible by Auctus into common stock of the Company through the later of the note maturity date or the payment of the
defined default amount in the event of default. The note carries a variable conversion price defined as 50% of the market price
(representing a 50% discount), with market price being defined as the lowest trading price of our common stock during the 25 trading
day period prior to the conversion date.  

(d) On
July 10, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $52,500 to the Vis Vires Group, Inc.
( VVG ). The note bears interest at 8% per annum, increased to 22% in the event of default, and matures April 13,
2016. VVG deducted $1,000 from the proceeds to cover their legal related costs which were charged to financing costs.  

The
note is convertible by VVG into common stock of the Company through the later of the note maturity date or the payment of the
defined amount in the event of default. The note carries a variable conversion price defined as 61% of the market price (representing
a 39% discount), with market price being defined as the average of the lowest three trading days for the Company s common
stock during the 10 day period prior to the conversion date. During the year, principal of $11,170 was converted into 11,946,753
shares of common stock, leaving a remaining balance due of $41,330 at December 31, 2015.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment
to the fixed amount (either conversion price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or
not within the issuers  control means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company
determined that the conversion prices of the Notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based on
the occurrence of future offerings or events. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion features of the Notes were
not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair value of the conversion features as derivative
liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the Notes in 2015, the initial fair value of the embedded
conversion feature was $531,579. As such, the Company recorded a $531,579 derivative liability, of which $304,861 was recorded
as debt discount offsetting the fair value of the Notes and the remainder of $226,105 was recorded as a financing cost in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The discount is being amortized using the effective
interest rate method over the life of the debt instruments. During the years ended December 31, amortization of debt discount
was $256,830, respectively. The unamortized balance of the debt discount was $78,666 as of December 31, 2015.  

The
convertible notes payable also contained certain a cross-default provision in case the Company will be in default of a similar
outstanding debt instrument. In October 2015, the Company s convertible note payable   related party amounting to
$543,115 matured and was deemed in default. As a result, the convertible notes were now deemed in default, as such, the holders
can accelerate the maturity of the Company  indebtedness. In addition, the Company also started accruing interest at an
average rate of 23% per annum pursuant to the terms of the note starting October 2015.  

Note
7   Convertible Notes Payable to Related Party   

At
December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding a promissory note of $150,000 payable to Alex Bafer, the Company s current
Chairman and former CEO. During 2015, the Company issued an additional $405,000 of promissory notes to Mr. Bafer, of which a note
of $25,000 was repaid. On July 9, 2015, the Company issued five convertible promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $543,115
to Mr. Bafer in exchange for his existing promissory notes and related accrued interest of $13,115. The convertible notes have
a maturity of October 1, 2015 and an annual interest rate of 5% per annum.  The noteholder has the right until the note(s)
is fully paid, to convert any outstanding and unpaid principal portion of the note, and accrued interest, into fully paid and
non-assessable shares of our common stock.  The notes have a conversion price of 50% of the lowest closing bid stock price
over the last twenty days prior to conversion.  The notes are currently in default.  

The
Company considered the current FASB guidance of  Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  which indicates that any adjustment
to the fixed amount (either conversion price or number of shares) of the instrument regardless of the probability of whether or
not within the issuers  control means the instrument is not indexed to the issuer s own stock. Accordingly, the Company
determined that the conversion prices of the Notes were not a fixed amount because they were subject to an adjustment based on
the occurrence of future offerings or events. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion features of the Notes were
not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and characterized the fair value of the conversion features as derivative
liabilities upon issuance. The Company determined that upon issuance of the convertible Notes in 2015, the initial fair value
of the embedded conversion feature was $1,499,918. The Company determined that the cancellation of the 2014 and 2015 promissory
notes in exchange for the convertible notes issued in 2015 was an extinguishment of debt, and the fair value of the derivative
liability of $1,499,918 created upon the exchange of debt instruments was a debt extinguishment cost during the year ended December
31, 2015.  

Note
8 - Derivative Liability   

The
FASB has issued authoritative guidance whereby instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative
instruments. Certain warrants issued to investors and conversion features of notes payable do not have fixed settlement provisions
because their exercise prices will be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future. In accordance with
the FASB authoritative guidance, the conversion feature of the notes was separated from the host contract (i.e., the notes) and
the fair value of the warrants have been recognized as a derivative and will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period
with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.  

The
Company had four convertible notes payable, five convertible note payable to a related party and warrants to purchase a total
of 900,000 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015 that were accounted for as derivative liability. The derivative liability
was valued at the following dates using a probability based weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following average
assumptions:  

The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility
of its common stock to estimate the future volatility for its common stock. The expected life of the warrant was determined by
the remaining contractual life of the derivative instrument. For derivative instrument that already matured, the Company used
the estimated life. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to its common stockholders
in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the future.  

In
2015, the Company recognized additional derivative liabilities of $454,361 related to the warrants issued in conjunction with
the sale of the Company s common stock (described in Note 9) and $2,031,497 related to the beneficial conversion feature
of certain of our notes payable. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a change in fair value of
the derivative liability of $2,262,774 and gain of $76,015 due to extinguishment of the derivative liability due to conversion
of certain notes to equity. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair value of the derivative liabilities was $4,672,617.  

Note
9 - Stockholders  Equity (Deficit)   

Sale
of Common Stock     

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 3,555,500 common shares for the cash of $191,250 at purchase prices ranging
from $0.005 to $0.20 per share.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 280,625 units at an average price of $0.53 per unit, for total proceeds of
$149,500. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock, one Class A warrant and one Class B warrant. The warrants are fully
vested, exercisable for two years from issuance at $3.00 and $6.00 per common share, respectively, and the exercise price and
the number of common shares issuable upon exercise is subject to reset based on future equity transactions. As the warrants issued
to do not have fixed settlement provisions because their exercise prices will be lowered if the Company issues securities at lower
prices in the future, the fair value of the warrants of $454,361 was recorded as a derivative liability upon issuance, of which,
$149,500 was recorded as a reduction to capital and the excess of the derivative liability over the aggregate cash proceeds received
of $304,861 was recognized as a private placement cost during the year ended December 31, 2015.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company sold 3,325,000 common shares for the cash amount of $197,496 at purchase prices

Under
the provisions of ASC 505 and the terms of the agreement with Mr. Kassar, the measurement date was determined to be the contract
date, with no vesting or forfeiture provisions or significant disincentives for non-performance. Accordingly, the fair value of
the issuance of the 500,000 shares at $500,000 was based on market price and was charged to compensation expense on the effective
date of the agreement. In addition, the Company granted Mr. Kassar warrants to purchase 500,00 common shares.

Summary
of the Company s Stock Warrant Activities   

The
following table summarizes information concerning outstanding and exercisable warrants as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:  

Warrants
Issued for Obtaining Employee Services    

In
February 2015, the Company granted warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Kassar, Chairman, upon his appointment
to the Board of Directors with a fair value of $400,000. The warrants are fully vested, exercisable for ten years from issuance
at $1.00 per common share.

to a consulting agreement with a fair value of $500,000. The warrants are fully vested, exercisable for ten years from issuance
at $0.001 per common share.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company granted additional warrants to purchase a total of 561,250 shares of common stock
as part of the sale of 280,625 units of common shares for total proceeds of $149,500. The warrants are fully vested upon grant,
have initial exercise price of $3.00 and $6.00 per share and will expire in 10 years.  

On
January 10, 2014, the Company awarded an employee warrants to purchase 1,491,350 common shares with an exercise price at $0.01
per share expiring five years from the date of issuance. The Warrant vested as follows: (i) on March 31, 2014, the right to exercise
the Warrant and to receive 50% of the Warrant Shares vested; (ii) on June 30, 2014, the right to exercise the Warrant and to receive
an additional 25% of the Warrant Shares vested; and (iii) on September 30, 2014, the right to exercise the Warrant and to receive
the remaining 25% of the Warrant Shares vested. The fair value of the warrants granted totaled $1,476,735. The warrants are fully
vested on the grant date absent forfeiture or performance criteria. Accordingly, the entire fair value of the grant, based on
a fair value of $1.00 per share was charged to compensation expense on the effective date of the agreement.  

The
Company estimated the fair value of the stock warrants on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with
the following weighted-average assumptions:

On

The

automobile allowance. During the year ended December 31,2015 and 2014, there were no cash bonus recorded.  

Litigation    

The
Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Except
for income tax contingencies (commencing April 1, 2009), the Company records accruals for contingencies to the extent that management
concludes that the occurrence is probable and that the related amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated
with the contingency are expensed as incurred.  

Studiocanal
S.A.  

The
Company is not currently engaged in any legal proceedings, however, the Company received a letter dated April 26, 2016 from Studiocanal
S.A., which claims to be the assignee of trademark rights in ce1tain marks previously registered by a company that has been defunct
since 1996. The letter stated that use of the marks by the Company is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive
as to whether there is an affiliation or association between the Company and the defunct entity and/or Studiocanal, and requested
that the Company cease and desist from use of such marks and relinquish trademark registrations legally obtained by the Company
and after judicial decision. The Company responded and discussions were held between representatives of the Company and Studiocanal.
At this time, Company is not aware of any legal claim having been brought by Studiocanal.  

Note
12 - Adjustment to Stockholders  Equity   

In
September 2013, the Company engaged the services of a consultant or finder for the acquisition of S G Holdings, Inc. (doing
business as High Five Entertainment) (SG) (see Note 3). In December 2013, the acquisition of SG was completed, and as a result,
the Company granted the consultant 400,000 shares of common stock for services rendered. The fair value of these shares was not
recorded in 2013. The shares were issued in 2014.  

As
the acquisition was completed in December 2013, the Company determined that the appropriate treatment is to account for the 400,000
shares of common stock, with a fair value of $400,000 in December 2013. As such, the Company adjusted the previously reported
balances in the Statement of Stockholders  Equity (Deficit) as of December 31, 2013 to account for the fair value of the
400,000 shares of common stock.  

The
impact of this error was an overstatement of expenses and net loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014 and twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2014, and an understatement of expenses for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2013.  

The
Company assessed the materiality of this error on the three and twelve month ended periods ended December 31, 2013 in accordance
with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 ( SAB 99 ) and concluded that the error was not material to
either period. However, the Company did conclude that the error was material to the three-month period ended March 31, 2014 and
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014, as it affected the results for that period. Therefore, in accordance with the SEC s
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 ( SAB 108 ), the 2014 financial statements were revised in the 2015 Annual Report
to correct for the immaterial error and to allow for the correct recording of this transaction in the 2013 consolidated financial
statements.  

The
correction has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and resulted in
a $400,000 decrease in expenses resulting in a $7,609,153 net loss ($0.12 per basic and diluted share).  

Note
13 - Income Tax Provision   

The
Company did not record any income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company files income tax returns
in the United States ( Federal ) and Florida ( State ) jurisdictions. The Company is subject to Federal
and State income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years since its inception.  

At
December 31, 2016, the Company had Federal and State net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income
of approximately $2.5 million. These carry forwards will begin to expire in the year ending December 31, 2017, subject to IRS
limitations, including change in ownership.  

The
Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and adjusts the carrying amount of the
deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is not judged to
be more likely than not. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred
tax assets, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss,
the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.  

At
December 31, 2015, based on the weight of available evidence, including cumulative losses in recent years and expectations of
future taxable income, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets of approximately $2.5
million would not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for 100% of its cumulative deferred
tax assets. The components of our deferred tax assets are as follows.  

A
reconciliation of income taxes with the amounts computed at the statutory federal rate are as follows:  

As
a result of the implementation of certain provisions of ASC 740-10, the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings
and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore, there were no unrecognized tax benefits
as of December 31, 2015.  

Future
changes in the unrecognized tax benefit are not expected to have an impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the
valuation allowance. The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not change within the next twelve months. The
Company will continue to classify income tax penalties and interest, if any, as part of interest and other expenses in its consolidated
statements of operations. There is no interest or penalties accrued as of December 31, 2015.  

Note
14 - Subsequent Events   

On
January 1, 2016, Sam Lupowitz and other shareholders, collectively representing Carolco Pictures, Inc. s controlling shareholders,
entered into and closed separate and distinct Securities Purchase Agreements with Tarek Kirschen whereby Tarek Kirschen purchased,
in the aggregate, 5,000,000 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Shares and a total of 30,000,000 common shares of
the Company s common stock (the  Shares ). Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock has one hundred votes
on all matters presented to the holders of Common Stock, resulting in Tarek Kirschen holding a majority of the issued and outstanding
voting capital shares of the Company. As a result of these transaction, Mr. Kirschen gained control of the Company and became
its Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  

On
January 22, 2016, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to Five Billion (5,000,000,000), par value
$.0001, and the number of shares of its preferred stock to Fifty Million (50,000,000), par value $.0001, the rights and preferences
of which to be determined by the Board of Directors. This action was taken in order to provide sufficient contractually required
reserve shares (in material multiples of the anticipated number of shares to be converted) of common stock for certain convertible
promissory notes.  

On
June 22, 2016, the  Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) by and between the Company,
Tarek Kirschen, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and South Centre, Inc. a firm owned by a non-related individual, David
Cohen. As part of the agreement, the Company issued to Mr. Kirschen 5,000,000 shares of Series A Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of
newly designated Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Series B Stock ) in as
settlement for $439,000 that was owed by the Company to Mr. Kirschen. In addition, Mr. Kirshen sold the 5 million Series A Stock
to Mr. David Cohen in exchange for $150,000. As a result, Mr. Cohen gained control of the Company and became its CEO.  

On
July 20, 2016, the Company amended its Convertible Promissory Notes with Alexander Bafer, whereby the maturity date of each of
our five loans from Mr. Bafer was amended to be August 1, 2017 instead of October 1, 2015. There were no other terms of the loans
changed, and we did not pay any consideration for the extension. Our outstanding balance on the loans under the Notes as of July
20, 2016 was approximately $469,000.  

On July 21, 2016,
the Company entered into a Redemption and Issuance Agreement (the  Redemption Agreement ) by and between the Company
and South Centre, Inc., an entity owned and controlled by David Cohen, the Company s sole director (at the time) and Chief
Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, on the same date, the Company redeemed 2,500,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock (the  Series A Stock ) in exchange for the payment to South Centre of $0.0001 per share,
for a total consideration of $250. The Company undertook the redemption for the purposes of obtaining the shares of Series A Stock
so that such shares could be paid to certain third parties in connection with the Contribution Agreement as disclosed below. Pursuant
to the Redemption Agreement, on the same date, the Company issued to South Centre 12,750,000 shares of newly designated Series
C Preferred Stock of the Company (the  Series C Stock ) in exchange for payment to the Company of $1,275. 

In
July 2016, the Company acquired Recall Studios, Inc. ( Recall ), a virtual reality and new media content production
company. As part of the acquisition, the Company acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Recall in exchange for the Company s
25,256,250 shares of Series C Stock and 2,500,000 shares of the Series. The Company engaged the services of a valuation specialist
to assist in the determination of the valuation of the acquisition and allocation of the purchase price. As of the date of this
report the Company is still finalizing the valuation.  

In July 2016, the
Company raised approximately $416,000 through the issuance of 487,000 shares of Recall s common stock. The Company and the
purchasers of these common stock are currently in negotiations to convert the 487,000 shares of Recall common stock to the Company s
Series C Preferred Stock. 

Subsequent
to December 31, 2015, the Company issued a total of 243,540,999 shares of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and
accrued interest of approximately $104,000.
