The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (all of which
consisted of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016. 

The balance sheet
at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. 

For further information,
refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

2.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:   

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16,  Business
Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   The amendments eliminate the requirement
to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. Adjustments to provisional
amounts that are identified during the measurement period are required to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments
are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and either disclosed on the face
of the income statement or in the notes by each category. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2016 and
plans to apply the provisions for all business combinations completed thereafter. The adoption did not have a material impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.

  (Unaudited)  

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement
(Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).  
The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. In addition, there is no requirement to make certain
disclosures for such investments. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2016 and plans to exclude the pension
assets that are measured using the net asset value per share from the fair value hierarchy disclosure. The adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 , Presentation of Financial
Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern.   Financial statements are generally prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue
to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. This ASU provides guidance on management s responsibility
to include footnote disclosures when there is substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2016 and will provide such disclosures as required if there are conditions
and events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The adoption did not have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:   

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 , Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments provide guidance in the presentation
and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method
investees. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be
applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions
on its consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments
 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The amendments require the credit
losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration should presented as an allowance
rather than a write down. It also allows recording of credit loss reversals in current period net income. The amendments are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019 with early application permitted
a year earlier. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12 , Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   The amendments provide clarifying guidance
on (i) the criteria of collectability and recognition of related revenue; (ii) election to exclude amounts collected from customers
for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (iii) measurement date for noncash consideration and variability
related to the form of consideration. In addition, the amendments provide a practical expedient (i) to reflect the aggregate effect
of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented; (ii) to clarify the status of completed
contracts under legacy GAAP and (iii) the disclosures related to the application of this guidance using the modified retrospective
or retrospective transition method. The Company plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2018 and is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-11 , Revenue Recognition
(Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09
and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting.   This ASU rescinds certain SEC guidance related
to (i) revenue and expense recognition for freight services; (ii) shipping and handling fees and costs; (iii) consideration given
by a vendor to a customer; and (iv) gas balancing arrangements that are currently codified under various topics .  The Company
plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions
on its consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 , Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   The amendments clarify the following two
aspects: (a) identifying performance obligations   better articulating the principle for determining whether promises to
transfer goods or services are separately identifiable and revising the related factors and examples to align with the clarification;
and (b) the licensing implementation guidance to improve its operability and understandability. The Company plans to adopt these
provisions in the first quarter of 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated
financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation  Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The amendments simplify several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification within the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any
organization in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its
consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   The amendments
relate to when another party, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer. Topic 606 requires
an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is
a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent).
The Company plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these
provisions on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-07, Investments  Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.   The amendments
eliminate the requirement to adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively when an investment
qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The
cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee is to be added to the current basis of the investor s previously
held interest and the equity method is to be adopted as of the date the investment becomes qualified for it. In addition, an entity
that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting is required to recognize
through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes
qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02   Leases (Topic
842).   Under the new guidance, lessees will need to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all
of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease), at the commencement of the lease term. The
liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment,
such as for initial direct costs. The amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases)
and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for
leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Updates No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments
  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments
make targeted improvements to existing U.S. GAAP and affects accounting for equity investments and financial instruments and liabilities
and related disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330):
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   Current requirements are to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.
Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximated normal profit margin. These
amendments allow inventory to be measured at lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the market requirement. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal,
and transportation. The amendments do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory
method. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The amendments are to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted. The Company plans to adopt these
provisions in the first quarter of 2017 and currently does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.    

Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606).   The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply a five step process
  (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining
the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognizing
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter
of 2018 in accordance with ASU 2015-14 that deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.

3.  EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods. In addition, the Company
has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are therefore considered
participating securities. Restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) outstanding and a reconciliation of weighted
average shares outstanding is as follows: 

4.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   

The Company reserved 3,000,000 shares of common stock
under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan with a term of ten years expiring in April 2024. All future equity compensation awards by the
Company will be issued under the 2014 plan. This plan provides for the issuance of various forms of stock incentives, including
among others, incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of September 30, 2016, there were approximately
2,250,300 shares available for grant.

5.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES   

Marine Products  marketable securities are
held with a large, well-capitalized financial institution. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities
at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale
because the Company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are stated at their
fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders  equity.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses, declines in value judged
to be other than temporary, interest and dividends on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. 

The net realized gains and the reclassification of
net realized gains from other comprehensive income are as follows: 

Gross unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities
are as follows:

The amortized cost basis, fair value and net unrealized
gains on the available-for-sale securities are as follows: 

Municipal obligations consist primarily of municipal
notes rated AA- or higher ranging in maturity from less than one year to over 20 years. Corporate obligations consist primarily
of debentures and notes issued by other companies ranging in maturity from one to five years. These securities are rated BBB+ or
higher. Investments with remaining maturities of less than 12 months are considered to be current marketable securities. Investments
with remaining maturities greater than 12 months are considered to be non-current marketable securities. The Company s non-current
marketable securities are scheduled to mature between 2017 and 2037. 

6.  WARRANTY COSTS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES   

Warranty Costs  

For our Chaparral products, Marine Products provides
a lifetime limited structural hull warranty against defects in material and workmanship for the original purchaser, and a five-year
limited structural hull warranty for one subsequent owner. Additionally, a non-transferable five-year limited structural deck warranty

a five-year limited hull warranty to one subsequent owner. Additionally, Marine Products provides a transferable one-year limited

The manufacturers of the engines included on our
boats provide various warranties on their products as well. An analysis of the warranty accruals for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

The warranty accruals are reflected
in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Repurchase Obligations  

The Company is a party to various agreements with
third party lenders that provide floor plan financing to qualifying dealers whereby the Company guarantees varying amounts of debt
on boats in dealer inventory. The Company s obligation under these guarantees becomes effective in the case of a default
under the financing arrangement between the dealer and the third party lender. The agreements provide for the return of repossessed
boats to the Company in new and unused condition subject to normal wear and tear as defined, in exchange for the Company s
assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on those boats, up to certain contractually determined dollar limits
by the lenders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company repurchased inventory for approximately $450 thousand.
The Company had no material repurchases of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

Management continues to monitor the risk of defaults
and resulting repurchase obligations based in part on information provided by third-party floor plan lenders and will adjust the
guarantee liability at the end of each reporting period based on information reasonably available at that time. 

The Company currently has an agreement with one of
the floor plan lenders whereby the contractual repurchase limit is to not exceed 16 percent of the amount of the average net receivables
financed by the floor plan lender for our dealers during the prior 12 month period, which was $9.3 million as of September 30,
2016. The Company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation
of approximately $6.0 million with various expiration and cancellation terms of less than one year, for an aggregate repurchase
obligation with all floor plan financing institutions of approximately $15.3 million as of September 30, 2016. 

7.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION   

The Company has only one reportable segment, its
powerboat manufacturing business; therefore, the majority of segment-related disclosures are not relevant to the Company. In addition,
the Company s results of operations and its financial condition are not significantly reliant upon any single customer or
product model. 

8.  INVENTORIES   

Inventories consist of the following: 

9.  INCOME TAXES   

The Company determines its periodic income tax provision
based upon the current period income and the annual estimated tax rate for the Company adjusted for any change to prior year estimates.
The estimated tax rate is revised, if necessary, as of the end of each successive interim period during the fiscal year to the
Company's current annual estimated tax rate.

  (Unaudited)  

For the third quarter of 2016, the income tax provision
reflects an effective tax rate of 23.3 percent, compared to an effective tax rate of 31.9 percent for the comparable period in
the prior year. The effective rate is the result of continued beneficial permanent differences including tax-exempt interest income,
and a favorable U.S. manufacturing deduction. The decrease in 2016 is primarily due to certain beneficial tax differences generated
from life insurance proceeds, favorable provision to return adjustments and a partial release of the deferred tax asset valuation
associated with certain of the company s state net operating losses. The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards
Update 2015-17 as of December 31, 2015 that requires all deferred tax balances to be classified as non-current. Accordingly, the
net deferred tax balance has been reflected as a non-current asset in the accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

The Company participates in a
multiple employer pension plan. The following represents the net periodic benefit and related components for the plan: 

The Company made contributions to this plan of $180
thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company permits selected highly compensated employees
to defer a portion of their compensation into a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ). The
Company maintains certain securities in the SERP that have been classified as trading. The SERP assets are marked to market and
totaled $5,545,000 as of September 30, 2016 and $6,491,000 as of December 31, 2015. The SERP assets are reported in other non-current
assets on the consolidated balance sheets and changes to the fair value of the assets are reported in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (Unaudited)  

Trading gains related to the SERP assets totaled approximately
$105,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to trading gains of $167,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

11.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The various inputs used to measure assets at fair
value establish a hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company s
assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of nine broad levels as follows: 

 1.       Level
1   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 2.       Level
2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or
can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

 3.       Level
3   Unobservable inputs developed using the Company s estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that market participants
would use. 

The following table summarizes the valuation of financial
instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a $0.06
per share cash dividend payable December 9, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2016. 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company offered to purchase
for cash 3.2 million of its outstanding common shares, par value $0.10 per share, at a purchase price of $9.00 per share, less
any applicable withholding taxes and without interest. The offer and withdrawal rights will expire on November 1, 2016, unless
the offer is extended or terminated (such time, as it may be extended, the  Expiration Time ). The Company in its sole
discretion may increase the number of shares it purchases up to 3.5 million shares without extending the Expiration Time. All expenses
related to the tender offer are accounted as part of the purchase cost of the shares and recorded as a reduction in the common
stock to the extent of par value and the excess recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital to the extent available and
then as a charge to retained earnings. 

On October 25, 2016 the Company announced that it extended the
terms of the previously announced tender offer and raised the offer price at which it is willing to purchase shares. The original
expiration date of the Tender Offer of November 1, 2016 was extended to November 11, 2016. The original offer price of $9.00 per
share was increased to $9.64 per share.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Marine Products Corporation, through our
wholly owned subsidiaries Chaparral and Robalo, is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats. Our sales and
profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products
to retail customers. These dealers are located throughout the continental United States and in several international markets. Many
of these dealers finance their inventory through third-party floor plan lenders, who pay Marine Products generally within seven
to ten days after delivery of the products to the dealers. 

The discussion on business and financial
strategies of the Company set forth under the heading  Overview  in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no significant changes in the
strategies since year-end. 

In implementing these strategies and attempting
to optimize our financial returns, management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories, the production mix of various models,
and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence, interest rates, dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences,
and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions. We also consider trends related to certain key financial
and other data, including our historical and forecasted financial results, market share, unit sales of our products, average selling
price per boat, and gross profit margins, among others, as indicators of the success of our strategies. Marine Products 
financial results are affected by consumer confidence   because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure, interest
rates   because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats, and other socioeconomic and environmental factors
such as availability of leisure time, consumer preferences, demographics and the weather. 

Our net sales were higher during the third
quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, but lower than the second quarter of 2016. The increase in net sales over
the prior year is primarily due to increases in unit sales among our Suncoast and Robalo outboard models, as well as our Vortex
jet boats. 

Operating income increased 22.6 percent
during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher gross profit, partially offset by
higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to expenses
that vary with sales. Dealer inventory in units as of September 30, 2016 was lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2016,
but higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2015. 

23   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

OUTLOOK   

The discussion of the outlook for 2016
is incorporated herein by reference from the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. 

We believe that recreational boating retail
demand in many segments of the industry is improving. Attendance and sales during the 2016 winter boat shows were moderately
higher than the 2015 winter boat shows, residential real estate markets and consumer confidence have stabilized, and fuel prices
have declined significantly. We also believe that there is improved demand from consumers who delayed purchasing a boat over the
past few years due to economic uncertainty. 

Although industry wide retail boat sales
remain lower than they were prior to the 2008 financial crisis, retail boat sales have increased each year since 2013. We believe
that continued improvements in retail boat sales will be modest due to the lack of strong economic improvement, which tends to
discourage consumers from purchasing large discretionary goods such as pleasure boats. Fluctuations in fuel prices can impact our
sales, and during 2015 and 2016 fuel prices decreased significantly, and have fallen to some of the lowest inflation-adjusted levels
recorded during the past 10 years. In general, however, the overall cost of boat ownership has increased, especially in the sterndrive
recreational boat market segment, which comprises almost 50 percent of the Company s sales. The higher cost of boat ownership
discourages consumers from purchasing recreational boats. For a number of years, Marine Products as well as other boat manufacturers
have been improving their customer service capabilities, marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers
to recreational boating as well as improve consumers  boating experiences. The Company provides financial incentives to its
dealers for receiving favorable customer satisfaction surveys. In addition, the recreational boating industry conducts a promotional
program which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts, as well as other activities designed to increase the potential
consumer market for pleasure boats. Many manufacturers, including Marine Products, participate in this program. Management believes
that these efforts have incrementally benefited the industry and Marine Products. As in past years, Marine Products enhanced its
selection of models for the 2017 model year which began on July 1, 2016. We continued to emphasize the value-priced Chaparral and
Robalo models, as well as a new Chaparral product lineup called the Surf Series. In addition, we continue to experience a favorable
consumer reception to our Chaparral Vortex jet boats and Chaparral SunCoast outboard boats. We believe that these boat models will
expand our customer base, and leverage our strong dealer network and reputation for quality and styling. During 2016 we also expanded
our nationally advertised fixed retail pricing to include more of our models. We plan to continue to develop and produce additional
new products for subsequent model years. 

Our financial results for 2016 will depend
on a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, the availability of credit to our dealers and consumers,
fuel costs, the continued acceptance of our new products in the recreational boating market, our ability to compete in the competitive
pleasure boating industry, and the costs of labor and certain of our raw materials and key components.

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Key operating and financial statistics
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Net sales  for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased $8.3 million or 17.7 percent compared to the comparable period in 2015. The change in net sales during the quarter compared
to the prior year was due primarily to a 12.5 percent increase in the number of units sold, coupled with a 1.7 percent increase
in the average selling price per boat. The increase in unit sales was due to higher Robalo unit sales during the quarter as compared
to the prior year, as well as increased unit sales of our Chaparral SunCoast outboards and Vortex jet boats. In the third quarter
of 2016, net sales outside of the United States increased to 8.5 percent of net sales compared to 7.9 percent of net sales in the
third quarter of 2015. Domestic net sales increased 17.0 percent compared to the third quarter of the prior year to $50.7 million. 

Cost of goods sold  for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $43.6 million compared to $37.2 million for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of $6.4 million
or 17.3 percent. Cost of goods sold was 78.7 percent of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 79.0
percent in the third quarter of the prior year. 

25   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Selling, general and administrative
expenses  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $6.3 million compared to $5.4 million for the comparable
period in 2015, an increase of 16.4 percent. This increase was due primarily to expenses that vary with sales coupled with
unfavorable claims experience recognized in the third quarter of 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 11.4 percent in the third quarter of 2016 from 11.5 percent in the third
quarter of 2015. 

Operating income  for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.0 million or 22.6 percent compared to the comparable period in 2015 due to higher gross profit,
partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Interest income  was $121 thousand during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $103 thousand for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in the average balance of our marketable securities portfolio. 

Income tax provision  for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.3 million compared to $1.5 million for the comparable period in 2015. The income
tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an effective tax rate of 23.3 percent compared to an
effective tax rate of 31.9 percent for the comparable period in the prior year. The third quarter 2016 effective tax rate is
the result of continued beneficial permanent differences including tax-exempt interest income and a favorable U.S.
manufacturing deduction. The decrease in 2016 compared to the prior year is primarily due to certain beneficial tax
differences generated from life insurance proceeds, favorable provision to return adjustments and a partial release of the
deferred tax asset valuation associated with certain of the company s state net operating losses. 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Net sales  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
increased $26.9 million or 17.1 percent compared to the comparable period in 2015. The change in net sales during the quarter compared
to the prior year was due primarily to a 19.2 percent increase in the number of units sold, partially offset by a 3.6 percent decrease
in the average selling price per boat. The increase in unit sales was due to higher Robalo unit sales during the year as compared
to the prior year, as well as increased unit sales of our Chaparral H2O sterndrive boats and SunCoast outboards. In the first nine
months of 2016, net sales outside of the United States accounted for 9.8 percent of net sales compared to 11.7 percent of net sales
in the first nine months of 2015. Domestic net sales increased 19.6 percent compared to the prior year to $166.1 million, while
international net sales decreased 2.0 percent to $18.0 million. 

Cost of goods sold  for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $145.8 million compared to $124.5 million for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of $21.3
million or 17.1 percent. Cost of goods sold was 79.2 percent of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for
the comparable period in 2015. 

26   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $20.4 million compared to $17.6 million for the comparable period in 2015, an
increase of 16.5 percent. This increase was due primarily to expenses that vary with sales coupled with unfavorable claims experience
in 2016. 

Operating income  for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.7 million or 17.8 percent compared to the comparable period in 2015 due to higher gross profit,
partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Interest income  was $364 thousand during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $325 thousand for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in the average balance of our marketable securities portfolio. 

Income tax provision  for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5.2 million compared to $5.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The income
tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an effective tax rate of 28.4 percent compared to an
effective tax rate of 32.3 percent for the comparable period in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is the result of continued beneficial permanent differences including tax-exempt interest income and
a favorable U.S. manufacturing deduction. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to certain beneficial tax
differences generated from life insurance proceeds, favorable provision to return adjustments and a partial release of the
deferred tax asset valuation associated with certain of the company s state net operating losses. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash Flows  

The Company s cash and cash equivalents at September 30,
2016 were $5.2 million compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash is primarily due to an increase in marketable
securities purchases, partially offset by an increase in net income. In addition, the aggregate of short-term and long-term marketable
securities was $41.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $35.0 million at December 31, 2015. 

The following table sets forth the cash flows for the applicable
periods: 

27   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased approximately $0.1 million compared to the comparable period in 2015. This increase is primarily due
to an increase in net income, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital. The major components of the net unfavorable
change in working capital were as follows: an unfavorable change of $5.0 million in inventories primarily due to the timing of
shipments of finished boats; an unfavorable change of $4.8 million in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of payments;
and a $5.1 million favorable change in accounts payable, due primarily to timing of payments. 

Cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was approximately $8.7 million compared to $2.0 million used for investing activities for the same period in
2015. The increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily due to increased purchases of marketable securities in the
current period, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. 

Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased approximately $1.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a
50.0 percent increase in the quarterly dividend paid, partially offset by a decrease in open market share repurchases in the first
nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. 

Financial Condition and Liquidity  

The Company believes that the liquidity provided by existing
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, its overall strong capitalization and cash generated by operations will provide
sufficient capital to meet the Company s requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company s decisions
about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position and the expected
amount of cash to be provided by operations. 

Cash Requirements  

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company
offered to purchase for cash 3.2 million of its outstanding common shares, par value $0.10 per share, at a purchase price of $9.00
per share, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest. The offer and withdrawal rights will expire on November
1, 2016, unless the offer is extended or terminated (such time, as it may be extended, the  Expiration Time ). The
Company in its sole discretion may increase the number of shares it purchases up to 3.5 million shares without extending the Expiration
Time. 

28   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

On October 25, 2016 the Company announced
that it extended the terms of the previously announced tender offer and raised the offer price at which it is willing to purchase
shares. The original expiration date of the Tender Offer of November 1, 2016 was extended to on November 11, 2016. The original
offer price of $9.00 per share was increased to $9.64 per share. We will use cash flow from operations and funds from selling our
marketable securities to fund the purchase of the shares tendered in the Offer and to pay fees and expenses related to the offer.
Assuming that the offer is fully subscribed for 3.2 million shares, we expect the aggregate purchase price for the shares, together
with all related fees and expenses, to be approximately $31.2 million ($34.0 million if the Offer is increased to 3.5 million shares).  

The Company currently expects that capital expenditures during
2016 will be approximately $3.5 million, of which $1.5 million has been spent through September 30, 2016. 

The Company participates in a multiple employer Retirement Income
Plan, sponsored by RPC, Inc. ( RPC ). The Company made a $180 thousand cash contribution to this plan during the first
nine months of 2016 and does not expect to make any additional contributions for the remainder of 2016. 

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has purchased a total
of 5,391,270 shares in the open market under the Company stock repurchase program and there are 2,858,730 shares that remain available
for repurchase under the current authorization. The Company repurchased 11,027 shares under this program during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

For our Chaparral products, Marine Products provides a lifetime
limited structural hull warranty against defects in material and workmanship for the original purchaser, and a five-year limited
structural hull warranty for one subsequent owner. Additionally, a non-transferable five-year limited structural deck warranty
against defects in materials and workmanship is available to the original owner. Warranties on additional items are provided for
periods of one to five years. 

For our Robalo products, Marine Products provides a transferable
ten-year limited structural hull warranty against defects in material and workmanship to the original owner, and a five-year limited
hull warranty to one subsequent owner. Additionally, Marine Products provides a transferable one-year limited warranty on other
components. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail of activity in the warranty accruals during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

To assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of
its boats for inventory, the Company has entered into agreements with various third-party floor plan lenders whereby the Company
guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory. The Company s obligation under these guarantees
becomes effective in the case of a default under the financing arrangement between the dealer and the third-party lender. The agreements
provide for the return of all repossessed boats to the Company in a new and unused condition as defined, in exchange for the Company s
assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on those boats, up to certain contractually determined dollar limits
which vary by lender. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company repurchased inventory for approximately $450
thousand. The Company had no material repurchases of inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

29   

MARINE PRODUCTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

Management continues to monitor the risk of defaults and resulting
repurchase obligations based in part on information provided by the third-party floor plan lenders and will adjust the guarantee
liability at the end of each reporting period based on information reasonably available at that time. 

The Company currently has an agreement with one of the floor
plan lenders whereby the contractual repurchase limit is to not exceed 16 percent of the amount of the average net receivables
financed by the floor plan lender for our dealers during the prior 12 month period, which was $9.3 million as of September 30,
2016. The Company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation
of approximately $6.0 million with various expiration and cancellation terms of less than one year, for an aggregate repurchase
obligation with all financing institutions of approximately $15.3 million as of September 30, 2016. 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

In conjunction with its spin-off from RPC in 2001, the Company
and RPC entered into various agreements that define their relationship after the spin-off. RPC charged the Company for its allocable
share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of Marine Products totaling approximately $559 thousand
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $550 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The discussion of Critical Accounting Policies is incorporated

by weather and general economic conditions. Quarterly operating results for the third quarter have historically recorded the highest
sales volume for the year because this corresponds with the highest retail sales volume period. The results for any quarter are
not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period.

INFLATION  

The market prices of certain material and component costs used
in manufacturing the Company s products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper and steel, have
been volatile in the years following the financial crisis of 2008. During 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, the prices of
several of these raw materials have fallen to their lowest prices in several years. As a result, we believe that the Company will
incur lower materials purchase prices in 2016. These lower prices of materials will reduce the costs of the Company s products,
but we do not expect that these lower prices will enhance our profit margins, due to the competitive nature of the selling environment
for the Company s products. Furthermore, the prices of these raw materials remain volatile, and may increase in the future. 

New boat buyers typically finance their purchases. Higher inflation
typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should higher inflation
and increased interest rates occur, prospective buyers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat
in the event that interest rates rise or credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Certain statements made in this report that are not historical
facts are  forward-looking statements  under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking
statements may include, without limitation, the expected effect of recent accounting pronouncements on the Company s consolidated
financial statements; the Company s estimate for warranty accruals; our belief that recreational boating retail demand in
many segments of the industry is improving; our belief that there is improved demand from consumers who have delayed purchasing
a boat over the past few years due to economic uncertainty; our belief that improvements in retail boat sales will be modest due
to the lack of economic improvement; the Company s belief that the recreational boating industry promotional program has
incrementally benefited the industry and Marine Products; the Company s belief that its newer boat models will expand its
customer base and leverage its strong dealer network and reputation for quality and styling; the Company s plan to develop
and introduce additional new products for subsequent years; our plans to continue to develop and produce additional new products
for subsequent model years; the Company s belief that its liquidity, capitalization and cash expected to be generated from
operations, will provide sufficient capital to meet the Company s requirements for at least the next twelve months; the Company s
expectations about capital expenditures during 2016; the Company s expectation about contributions to its pension plan in
2016; the Company s expectations about its tender offer; the Company s belief about the amount and timing of inventory
repurchases; the Company s belief that it will incur lower material purchase prices in 2016 which will reduce the costs of
the Company s products, although the Company does not expect that these lower prices will enhance its profit margins; the
Company s expectation regarding market risk of its investment portfolio; and the Company s expectations about the effect
of litigation on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

The words  may,   should,   will, 
 expect,   believe,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   seek, 
 project,   estimate,  and similar expressions used in this document that do not relate to historical facts
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by our
management in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments
and other factors it believes to be appropriate. We caution you that such statements are only predictions and not guarantees of
future performance and that actual results, developments and business decisions may differ from those envisioned by the forward-looking
statements. Risk factors that could cause such future events not to occur as expected include the following: economic conditions,
unavailability of credit and possible decreases in the level of consumer confidence impacting discretionary spending, business
interruptions due to adverse weather conditions, increased interest rates, unanticipated changes in consumer demand and preferences,
deterioration in the quality of Marine Products  network of independent boat dealers or availability of financing of their
inventory, our ability to insulate financial results against increasing commodity prices, the impact of rising gasoline prices
and a weak housing market on consumer demand for our products, competition from other boat manufacturers and dealers, and insurance
companies that insure a number of Marine Products  marketable securities have been downgraded, which may cause volatility
in the market price of Marine Products  marketable securities. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results
to differ from management s projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company does not undertake to update
its forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

Marine Products does not utilize financial instruments for trading
purposes and, as of September 30, 2016, did not hold derivative financial instruments that could expose the Company to significant
market risk. Also, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s investment portfolio, totaling approximately $41.7 million and
comprised primarily of municipal and corporate debt securities, is subject to interest rate risk exposure. This risk is managed
through conservative policies to invest in high-quality obligations that are both short-term and long-term in nature. Because Marine
Products  investment portfolio mix has been allocated towards securities with similar term maturities compared to the end
of fiscal year 2015, the risk of material market value fluctuations is not expected to be significantly different from the end
of fiscal year 2015 and the Company currently expects no such changes through the remainder of the current year. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable
assurance level as of the Evaluation Date. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting    Management s evaluation of changes in internal control did not identify any changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
