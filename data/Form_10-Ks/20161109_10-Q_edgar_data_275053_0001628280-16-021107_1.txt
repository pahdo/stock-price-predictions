  Nature s Sunshine Products, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to collectively as the  Company ), is a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products. The Company is a Utah corporation with its principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sells its products to a sales force of independent distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to other independent distributors or consumers.

  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals), considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial information as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Restructuring Related Activities 
    
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company announced a restructuring plan that has been substantially completed.  Of the   $3.3 million   of non-recurring restructuring costs incurred during the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.1 million   of other exit costs remained payable as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $0.6 million   of severance costs and   $0.2 million   of other exit costs remained payable as of   December 31, 2015  . There were   $0   and   $2.4 million   of restructuring costs incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Noncontrolling interest decreased as a result of the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests by   $0.7 million   and   $0.7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606). This update requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. As such, this update affects an entity that either enters into contracts with customers or transfers goods and services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. This update will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance, and creates Topic 606.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  -  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ,     which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations contained in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  -  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which further clarifies the implementation guidance relating to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. These standards, pursuant to ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  -  Deferral of the Effective Date   issued by the FASB in August 2015, will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements: "Going Concern"   (Subtopic 205-40). The purpose of this ASU is to incorporate into U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and to provide related footnote disclosures. This update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330):   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . This update specifies that inventory should be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the ordinary selling price less any completion, transportation and disposal costs. However, the ASU does not apply to inventory measured using the last-in-first-out or retail methods. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740):   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . This guidance requires that entities with a classified statement of financial position present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require the Company to adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Other than the netting of current and long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities in the non-current section of the balance sheet and footnote disclosures, the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   This update amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842):   Accounting for Leases  . This update specifies that lessees should recognize assets and liabilities arising from all leases, except for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will largely remain unchanged and continue to depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. For public companies, the ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations; however, it is expected to gross-up the consolidated balance sheet as a result of recognizing a lease asset along with a similar lease liability.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements. 

(2)                           Discontinued Operations 
    
  In November 2014, the Company ceased its operations in Venezuela due to the difficulties and uncertainties related to import controls, difficulties associated with repatriating cash and high inflation. This market was part of the Company s NSP Americas segment and all of the income from discontinued operations is attributable to the common shareholders of the Company. 
    
  The following table summarizes the operating results of the Company s discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received   $1.3 million   in net proceeds from the sales of its fixed assets in Venezuela, which is included in the Company's results from discontinued operations. Also during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company released   $0.8 million   in accrued liabilities, net of tax, related to prior sales and use taxes as well as other litigation in Brazil, which is included in the results from discontinued operations. The Company ceased its operations in Brazil in 2010. 

(3)                           Inventories 
    
  The composition of inventories is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): 

(4)                           Investments 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair values of available-for-sale securities by balance sheet classification are as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

There were   no   proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The Company s trading securities portfolio totaled   $1.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $1.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  , and generated gains of   $78,000   and losses of   $37,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an unrealized loss of   $3,000   and   $22,000  , respectively, in its U.S. government securities funds. There were   no   securities that were in a loss position for more than 12 months. 

(5)                           Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  The Company s revolving credit facility agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., permits the Company to borrow up to   $25.0 million   through September 1, 2017, bearing interest at   LIBOR   plus   1.25 percent   (  1.75 percent   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ). The Company must pay an annual commitment fee of   0.25 percent   on the unused portion of the commitment. The revolving credit facility matures on September 1, 2017. The Company settles its net borrowings under the revolving credit facility daily, and as a result, has classified its outstanding borrowings as current on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was   $9.0 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  The revolving credit facility agreement contains restrictions on leverage, minimum net income and consecutive quarterly net losses. In addition, the agreement restricts capital expenditures, lease expenditures, other indebtedness, liens on assets, guaranties, loans and advances and the merger, consolidation and the transfer of assets except in the ordinary course of business. The Company was in compliance with these debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(6)                           Net Income Per Share 
    
  Basic net income per common share ( Basic EPS ), is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share ( Diluted EPS ) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income per common share.

Following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of Basic EPS to the numerator and denominator of Diluted EPS for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollar and share amounts in thousands, except for per share information):  

Potentially dilutive shares excluded from diluted-per-share amounts include performance-based options to purchase shares of common stock for which certain earnings metrics have not been achieved. Potentially anti-dilutive shares excluded from diluted-per-share amounts include both non-qualified stock options and unearned performance-based options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the weighted-average share price during the period and shares that would be anti-dilutive to the computation of diluted net income per share for each of the years presented.

  Dividends 
    
  The declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including the Company s earnings, financial condition, restrictions imposed by any indebtedness that may be outstanding, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the Company announced a cash dividend of   $0.10   per common share in an aggregate amount of   $1.9 million  , which was paid on March 22, 2016, to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2016.

  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  In November 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a   $20.0 million   share repurchase program beginning January 1, 2015. Such purchases may be made in the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined based on the Company s evaluation of market conditions and other factors and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining balance available for repurchases under the program was   $13.4 million  . There were   no   repurchases of common shares by the Company during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company s shareholders adopted and approved the Nature s Sunshine Products, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2012 Incentive Plan ).  The 2012 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards, stock awards and other stock-based awards.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has authority and discretion to determine the type of award, as well as the amount, terms and conditions of each award under the 2012 Incentive Plan, subject to the limitations of the 2012 Incentive Plan. A total of   1,500,000   shares of the Company s common stock were originally authorized for the granting of awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan. In 2015, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Incentive Plan, to increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance by   1,500,000   shares. The number of shares available for awards, as well as the terms of outstanding awards, are subject to adjustment as provided in the 2012 Incentive Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events. 
    
  The Company also maintains a stock incentive plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2009 (the  2009 Incentive Plan ). The 2009 Incentive Plan also provided for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards, stock awards and other stock-based awards.  Under the 2012 Incentive Plan, any shares subject to award, or awards forfeited or reacquired by the Company issued under the 2009 Incentive Plan are available for award up to a maximum of   400,000   shares. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The Company s outstanding stock options include time-based stock options, which vest over differing periods ranging from the date of issuance up to   48 months   from the option grant date; performance-based stock options, which have already vested upon achieving operating income margins of   six  ,   eight   and   ten percent   as reported in four of five consecutive quarters over the term of the options; performance-based stock options, which vest upon achieving cumulative annual net sales revenue growth targets over a rolling   two  -year period, subject to the Company maintaining at least an   eight percent   operating income margin during the applicable period; and performance-based stock options, which vest upon achieving annual net sales targets over a rolling   one  -year period. 
    
  Stock option activity for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , is as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share information): 

Share-based compensation expense from time-based stock options for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. Share-based compensation expense from time-based stock options for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.2

     Table of Contents  

million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to the grants described above was   $0.5 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of approximately   1.2 years  . 
    
  The Company has not recognized any share-based compensation expense related to the net sales revenue performance-based stock options for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Should the Company attain all of the net sales revenue metrics related to the net sales revenue performance-based stock option grants, the Company would recognize up to   $0.4 million   of potential share-based compensation expense. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options to purchase   1,592,000   shares of common stock, exercisable stock options to purchase   1,135,000   shares of common stock and stock options to purchase   377,000   shares of common stock that are expected to vest was   $5.4 million  ,   $4.4 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. At   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options to purchase   1,683,000   shares of common stock, the exercisable options to purchase   958,000   shares of common stock, and options to purchase   588,000   shares of common stock expected to vest was   $0.9 million  ,   $0.9 million   and   $0  , respectively. 
    
  For the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company issued   32,000   and   399,000   shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options at an average exercise price of   $3.99   and   $9.79   per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of options exercised during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $0.2 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. For the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options during the period, respectively. 
    
  Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The Company s outstanding restricted stock units ("RSUs") include time-based RSUs, which vest over differing periods ranging from   12 months   up to   48 months   from the RSU grant date. RSUs granted to the Board of Directors contain a restriction period in which the shares are not issued until   two   years after vesting. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   44,000   and   60,000  , respectively, vested RSUs that have been granted to the Board of Directors that have vested but remain subject to the   two  -year restriction period. 
    
  RSU activity for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , is as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share information): 

During the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   246,000   RSUs under the 2012 Incentive Plan to the Company s Board of Directors, executive officers and other employees, which are composed of both time-based RSUs and net sales and operating income and earnings-per-share performance-based RSUs. The time-based RSUs were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $9.73   per share and vest in annual installments over a   three  -year period from the grant date or according to the restrictions for the Board of Directors noted above. The net sales and operating income and earnings-per-share performance-based RSUs were issued with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $8.16   per share and vest upon achieving both (i) net sales and operating income targets over a   three  -year period from the grant date and (ii) earnings-per-share targets over a   six  -year period from the grant date. 
    
  RSUs are valued at market value on the date of grant, which is the grant date share price discounted for expected dividend payments during the vesting period.   
    
  Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively. Share-based compensation expense from RSUs for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was approximately   $1.8 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to the grants  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

described above, excluding incentive awards discussed below, was   $2.3 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. The remaining compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately   1.5 years  . 
    
  The Company has not recognized any share-based compensation expense related to the net sales revenue and earnings-per-share performance-based RSUs for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Should the Company attain all of the net sales revenue metrics related to the net sales revenue performance-based stock option grants, the Company would recognize up to   $3.3 million   of potential share-based compensation expense. 
    
  The number of shares issued upon vesting of RSUs granted pursuant to the Company's share-based compensation plans is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays on behalf of its employees, which was   20,000   shares for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated as common share repurchases for accounting purposes, as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These shares do not count against the authorized capacity under the repurchase program described above.  

(8)                           Segment Information 
    
  The Company has   four   business segments. These business segments are components of the Company for which separate information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing relative performance. 
    
  The Company's   four   business segments are divided based on the different characteristics of their distributor bases, selling and distributor compensation plans and product formulations, as well as the internal organization of its officers and their responsibilities and business operations.    Three   business segments operate under the Nature s Sunshine Products brand (NSP Americas; NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe; and China and New Markets). The Company s China and New Markets segment anticipates deploying a multi-channel go-to-market strategy that offers select Nature s Sunshine branded products through a direct selling model across China as well as through e-commerce channels.  The time to market will be dependent upon regulatory processes including product registration, permit and license approvals. The China and New Markets segment also includes the Company s wholesale business, in which the Company sells its products to various locally managed entities independent of the Company that have distribution rights for the relevant market. The fourth business segment operates under the Synergy  WorldWide brand.

  (1)       Contribution margin consists of net sales revenue less cost of sales and volume incentives expense.  For the China and New Markets segment, contribution margin does not include service fees related to pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong.  
    
  (2)      Service fees in the China and New Markets segment related to pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong totaled   $1.5 million   and   $3.4 million   for the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $0   for the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . These service fees are included in the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses.

(9)                    Income Taxes 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was   22.4 percent   and   44.4 percent  , respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0 percent  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was   34.6 percent   and   26.0 percent  , respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0 percent  . 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was attributed to foreign tax credit benefits and a decrease in tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the impact of current year losses that will not provide tax benefit. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was attributed to foreign tax credit benefits and a decrease in tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, offset by the impact of current year losses that will not provide tax benefit. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributed to current year foreign losses that presently do not provide future tax benefits, partially offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributed to the valuation allowances on U.S. foreign tax credits and on U.S. capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by the impact of current year losses that presently do not provide a future tax benefit. 
    
  Changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and the impact of foreign tax credits are expected to be recurring. Depending on various factors, changes from the foregoing items may be favorable or unfavorable in a particular period. 
    
  The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2013 through 2015 are open to examination for federal tax purposes. The Company has several foreign tax jurisdictions that have open tax years from 2009 through 2015. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company had accrued   $6.1 million   related to unrecognized tax positions, compared with   $7.8 million   as of December 31, 2015. This net decrease was primarily attributed to changes in contingencies related to international tax. 
    
  Interim income taxes are based on an estimated annualized effective tax rate applied to the respective quarterly periods, adjusted for discrete tax items in the period in which they occur. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the Company can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which it has reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Such differences could have a material impact on the Company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which the Company makes such determination. 

(10)                      Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is party to various legal proceedings. Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, or their resulting effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

operations or cash flows as litigation and related matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for the period in which the ruling occurs and/or future periods. The Company maintains product liability, general liability and excess liability insurance coverage. However, no assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available at an acceptable cost to the Company, that such coverage will be sufficient to cover   one   or more large claims, or that the insurers will not successfully disclaim coverage as to a pending or future claim. 
    
  Non-Income Tax Contingencies 
    
  The Company has reserved for certain state sales and use tax and foreign non-income tax contingencies based on the likelihood of an obligation in accordance with accounting guidance for probable loss contingencies. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. The Company provides provisions for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities for contingencies related to non-income tax matters, including value-added taxes and sales tax. The Company provides provisions for U.S. state sales taxes in each of the states where the Company has nexus. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accrued liabilities were   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, related to non-income tax contingencies. While management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine this liability are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of those matters cannot presently be determined. The Company believes future payments related to these matters could range from   $0   to approximately   $4.2 million  . 
    
  Other Litigation 
    
  The Company is party to various other legal proceedings in several foreign jurisdictions related to value-added tax assessments and other civil litigation.  While there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, either the losses are not considered to be probable or the Company cannot at this time estimate the loss, if any; therefore,   no   provision for losses has been provided.  The Company believes future payments related to these matters could range from   $0   to approximately   $0.2 million  . 

(11)                    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values of each financial instrument. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
    
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

  OVERVIEW 
    
  Nature s Sunshine Products, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products. The Company is a Utah corporation with its principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sells its products to customers and to a sales force of independent distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to consumers. The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of each of the Company's major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies. 
    
  The Company has four business segments that are divided based on the different characteristics of their Distributor bases, selling and Distributor compensation plans and product formulations, as well as the internal organization of its officers and their responsibilities and business operations.  Three business segments operate under the Nature s Sunshine Products brand (NSP Americas; NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe; and China and New Markets). The Company s China and New Markets segment anticipates deploying a multi-channel go-to-market strategy that offers select Nature s Sunshine branded products through a direct selling model across China as well as through e-commerce channels.  The time to market will be dependent upon regulatory processes including product registration, permit and license approvals. The China and New Markets segment also includes the Company s wholesale business, in which the Company sells its products to various locally managed entities independent of the Company that have distribution rights for the relevant market. All of the net sales revenue to date in the China and New Markets segment is through the Company s wholesale business to foreign markets, and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong. The fourth business segment operates under the Synergy  WorldWide brand. 
    
   The Company markets its products in Australia, Austria, Belarus, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Company markets its products through a wholesale model to Australia, Brazil, Chile, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company experienced an increase in its consolidated net sales of   7.4 percent   (an increase of   6.1 percent   in local currencies), compared to the same period in   2015  . NSP Americas net sales decreased approximately   2.7 percent   (or   2.1 percent   in local currencies), compared to the same period in   2015  . NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe net sales increased approximately   1.6 percent   compared to the same period in   2015  . China and New Markets net sales increased   349.6   percent compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of the pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong as the Company prepares its broader Greater China business initiatives. Synergy WorldWide net sales increased approximately   12.7 percent   (or   7.7 percent   in local currencies) compared to the same period in   2015  . During the quarter, the NSP Americas segment experienced net sales growth in local currencies in the United States and Canada. NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe experienced similar net sales growth in local currencies. The Synergy Worldwide segment experienced net sales growth in local currencies in Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Europe. These increases were offset by declines in local currencies sales in the NSP Americas segment in Latin America, and in the Synergy Worldwide segment in North America. Changes in the local currencies of the Company's foreign markets as compared to the U.S. dollar resulted in a favorable increase of   $1.0 million  , or   1.3 percent   increase of its net sales during the quarter. 
    
  Although sales increased during the quarter, the Company expects that sales in NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe will continue to be affected by political unrest in Ukraine and Russia, sanctions against Russia and the significant impact of currency devaluation. The Company remains strongly supportive and engaged with its independent Distributors in the region, and believes its solid foundation and strong relationships in the region will allow it to return to consistent growth when the political situation and currency values stabilize.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $2.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Over the same period, selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales revenue for   2016  , increased to   34.2 percent   from   34.1 percent   in   2015  . The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily related to payment of   $1.5 million   of independent service fees related to the Company's pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong, increased investment of $0.5 million in China and increased non-capitalizable internal labor costs of $0.5 million related to the Oracle ERP implementation project, partially offset by $0.3 million reduction related to prior year non-recurring restructuring charges. 
    
  The Company distributes products to consumers through a sales force comprised of independent distributors, some of whom also consume the Company's products. Typically a person who joins the Company's independent sales force begins as a distributor. A distributor may earn Manager status by attaining certain product sales levels. On a worldwide basis, active Managers were approximately   13,200   and   13,000  , and active Distributors and customers were approximately   244,500   and   256,800  , at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, in part due to declines in the NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment as well as the Latin markets in the NSP Americas segment. 
    
  Net sales revenue     represents net sales including shipping and handling revenues offset by volume rebates given to independent distributors and customers. Volume rebates as a percentage of retail sales may vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict rebates. The Company also offers reduced volume rebates with respect to certain products and promotions worldwide.  For pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong, the Company pays independent service fees, which are included in the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses. 
    
  The Company's gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales, which represents manufacturing costs, the price it pays to its raw material suppliers and manufacturers of its products, duties and tariffs, as well as shipping and handling costs related to product shipments and distribution to its independent distributors and customers. 
    
  Volume incentives are a significant part of the Company's direct sales marketing program, and represent commission payments made to independent distributors. These payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels. Volume incentives vary slightly, on a percentage basis, by product due to pricing policies and commission plans in place in the various countries.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses     represent operating expenses, components of which include labor and benefits, sales events, professional fees, travel and entertainment, marketing, occupancy costs, communication costs, bank fees, depreciation and amortization, independent service fees related to pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong and other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
    
   Most of the Company's sales to independent distributors and customers outside the United States are made in the local currency of the independent distributor or customer. In preparing the financial statements, the Company translates revenue into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the periods reported. Additionally, the majority of the Company's purchases from its suppliers generally are made in U.S. dollars. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on reported sales and contribution margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions.

Net Sales Revenue 
    
  The Company s international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of its total net sales. As a result, total net sales will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how its underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, in addition to comparing the percent change in net sales from one period to another in U.S. dollars, the Company compares the percentage change in net sales from one period to another period by excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange as shown below. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations is not a U.S. GAAP financial measure. Net sales in local currency removes from net sales in U.S. dollars the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries, by translating the current period net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous

comparable period. The Company believes presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of its foreign operations from period to period. However, net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Throughout the last five years, foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly. See Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  .

Consolidated net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $85.4 million   and   $257.2 million  , respectively, compared to   $79.6 million   and   $244.7 million   for the same periods in   2015  , which are increases of approximately   7.4 percent   and   5.1 percent  , respectively. The increase was principally related to increases in the Synergy WorldWide and China and New Markets segments. Synergy WorldWide increased   $3.5 million   and   $9.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . China and New Markets increased   $3.4 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were impacted by a favorable   $1.0 million   and an unfavorable   $2.7 million   in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, respectively. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consolidated net sales revenue increased by   6.1 percent   and   6.2 percent   from the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  NSP Americas 
    
  Net sales revenue from the Company's NSP Americas segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $43.3 million   and   $133.2 million  , respectively, compared to   $44.5 million   and   $136.0 million   for the same periods in   2015  , or decreases of   2.7 percent   and   2.1 percent  , respectively. In local currency, net sales decreased   2.1 percent   and   0.8 percent  , compared to the same   three and nine   month periods in   2015  , respectively. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had a   $0.3 million   and   $1.8 million   unfavorable impact on net sales for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Active Managers within NSP Americas totaled approximately   6,500   and   6,800   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Active Distributors and customers within NSP Americas totaled approximately   125,900   and   136,900   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The number of independent Managers, Distributors and customers decreased primarily due attrition as well as fewer new Distributors and customers joining the Company in its Latin American markets. Independent Managers and active independent Distributors and customers were down   7.9 percent  , compared to the prior year. The active independent Managers category includes independent Managers under the Company's various compensation plans that have achieved and maintained certain product sales levels. As such, all independent Managers are considered to be active independent Managers. The active independent Distributors and customers category includes independent Distributors and customers who have purchased products directly from the Company for resale and/or personal consumption during the previous three months. 
    
  Notable activity in the following markets contributed to the results of NSP Americas: 
    
  In the United States, net sales revenue increased approximately $0.1 million and $1.1 million, or 0.2 percent and 1.1 percent, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same period in   2015  . This market has experienced year-over-year growth for nine consecutive quarters in part due to the implementation of new sales programs. More specifically, it has experienced increased adoption of retail sales tools and the IN.FORM business model, which is a group-focused weight management program incorporating a habit of healthy eating, daily activity and consumption of the Company's products. 
    
  In Canada, net sales revenues increased approximately $27,000 and decreased $0.3 million, or increased 1.1 percent and decreased 3.3 percent, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same period in   2015  . In local currency, net sales increased 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent compared to the same periods in   2015  , which is the ninth consecutive quarter of growth year over year. The Company believes increased momentum in this market has been a result of the increased adoption of the IN.FORM business model and the introduction of nine new products. 
    
  In Latin America, net sales revenues decreased approximately   $1.3 million   and   $3.7 million  , or   16.4 percent   and   15.1 percent  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . In local currency, net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , decreased   12.4 percent   and   9.3 percent  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Currency devaluation had a   $0.3 million   and   $1.4 million   unfavorable impact on net sales for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Net sales revenue in Latin America continues to be negatively impacted by changing regulations for product registration that affect the Company's ability to sell some of its products in certain countries in Latin America. To address this, the Company continues to emphasize the IN.FORM business model, which includes products the Company anticipates will be acceptable for registration under the changing product registration requirements in Latin America. 
    
     NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 
    
  Net sales revenue related to NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe markets (primarily Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus), for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $6.4 million   and   $19.0 million  , respectively, compared to   $6.3 million   and   $20.6 million   for the same periods in   2015  , or an increase of   1.6 percent   and a decrease of   7.5 percent  , respectively. Active independent Managers within NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe totaled approximately   2,600   and  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

2,700   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Active independent Distributors and customers within NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe totaled approximately   60,600   and   66,500   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net sales and the number of independent Managers, Distributors and customers buying and distributing the Company's products continue to struggle primarily as a result of the current political uncertainty in Ukraine and across the region, and the market decline in the value of the Ukrainian hryvnia and Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. Although changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia do not result in currency fluctuations within the financial statements, the Company s products in Ukraine and Russia are priced in local currencies pegged to current U.S. dollar exchange rates and therefore become more expensive when the local currency declines in value relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company remains strongly supportive of and engaged with its independent distributors in the region, and are supporting their activity with additional promotions and training. However, at this time, the Company expects that sales in its NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment will continue to be significantly affected by the political unrest in Ukraine and Russia, sanctions in Russia and the impact of currency devaluation. The Company continues to evaluate various options to keep the distributor base engaged. The Company believes that its strong partnership with its local partner will provide a solid foundation to reignite growth once the political and economic conditions stabilize. 
    
  Synergy WorldWide 
    
  Synergy WorldWide reported net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $31.3 million   and   $94.2 million  , respectively, compared to   $27.8 million   and   $85.0 million   for the same periods in   2015  , or increases of   12.7 percent   and   10.8 percent  , respectively. This increase was primarily due to sales growth in the segment's Asia Pacific and Europe regions, partially offset by sales declines in North America. The   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were impacted by a favorable   $1.4 million   and an unfavorable   $0.8 million   in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, respectively. In local currency, net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in Synergy WorldWide would have increased by   7.7 percent   and   11.7 percent   from the same periods in   2015  . Active independent Managers within Synergy WorldWide totaled approximately   4,100   and   3,500   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Active independent Distributors and customers within Synergy WorldWide totaled approximately   55,600   and   53,400   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Synergy WorldWide s business model is operating under a traditional direct selling method.  
    
  Notable activity in the following markets contributed to the results of Synergy WorldWide: 
    
  In South Korea, net sales revenue increased $1.9 million and $6.4 million, or 15.5 percent and 17.6 percent, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . In local currency, net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased 10.7 percent and 21.8 percent compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase in local currency net sales was primarily due to launching new distributor acquisition programs, including a new home health party program and improvements in the rank advancement and recognition programs. 
    
  In Japan, net sales revenue increased $0.7 million and $2.6 million, or 22.4 percent and 29.4 percent, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . In local currency, net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased 2.2 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The Company continues to see growth due to the introduction of new products and the implementation of programs to stimulate activity, including the adoption of Korea's distributor recognition program, which had a positive impact on sales volume in this market in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In Europe, net sales revenue increased   $36,000   and decreased   $0.4 million  , or increased   0.6 percent   and decreased   1.9 percent  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, had minimal impacts on net sales revenue during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. In local currency, net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased   0.3 percent   and decreased   2.0 percent   compared to the same periods in   2015  . Net sales revenue in Europe during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was negatively impacted by residual sales in the prior year periods tied to the launch of the Company's weight management product plan that did not recur during the same periods this year.  This quarter represents the first quarter of year-over-year sales growth in local currency after four quarters of decline.  
    
  In North America, net sales revenue decreased approximately   $0.2 million   and   $1.0 million  , or   8.0 percent   and   10.4 percent  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The decline in net sales revenue is primarily driven by the enrollment of fewer new Distributors and attraction of fewer customers. Growth initiatives have been developed and implemented to more effectively attract new Distributors and provide improved training and motivation.

China and New Markets 
    
  China and New Markets had net sales revenue from wholesale activities and pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $4.4 million   and   $10.8 million  , respectively, compared to   $1.0 million   and   $3.0 million   for the same periods in   2015  , increases of   349.6 percent   and   255.0 percent  . The net sales increase is the result of the pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong. All sales in 2015 related to sales from the wholesale division.  
      
  Further information related to NSP Americas, NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, Synergy WorldWide, and China and New Markets business segments is set forth in Note 8 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this report. 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Cost of sales as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to   25.2 percent   and   25.9 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   25.9 percent   and   26.0 percent   for the same periods in   2015  . The decrease in the cost of sale percentage for the three month period is primarily due to increased production volumes and change in market mix. 
    
  Volume Incentives 
    
  Volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to   34.7 percent   and   35.1 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   36.0 percent   and   36.2 percent   in   2015  .  The decrease in volume incentives as a percent of net sales for the period is primarily due to changes in segment market mix such as the sales growth in China and New Markets related to pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong, for which no volume incentives are paid.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately   $2.1 million   and   $8.0 million   to   $29.2 million   and   $88.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Selling, general and administrative expenses were   34.2 percent   and   34.5 percent   of net sales revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   34.1 percent   and   33.0 percent   for the same periods in   2015  . The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was primarily related to: 

$1.5 million   and   $3.4 million   of independent service fees, respectively, related to the Company's pre-opening product sales through Hong Kong incurred during the periods; 
                
    $0.5 million and $2.7 million of increased investment in China during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively; and 
                
    $0.5 million and $2.2 million of increased non-capitalizable internal labor costs related to the Oracle ERP implementation project incurred during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
                
    The increase in SG A was partially offset by reduction of $0.3 million and $2.4 million related to prior year non-recurring restructuring charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
       
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
    
  Other income (expense) net, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased   $0.3 million   and   $1.5 million   to   $20,000   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015  . The change in other income was primarily due to changes in foreign exchange gains and losses. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was   22.4 percent   and   44.4 percent  , respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0 percent  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company s provision for income taxes, as a percentage of income before income taxes was   34.6 percent   and   26.0 percent  , respectively, compared with a U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0 percent  .

The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was attributed to foreign tax credit benefits and a decrease in tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the impact of current year losses that will not provide tax benefit. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was attributed to foreign tax credit benefits and a decrease in tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, offset by the impact of current year losses that will not provide tax benefit. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributed to current year foreign losses that presently do not provide future tax benefits, partially offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits. 
    
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributed to the valuation allowances on U.S. foreign tax credits and on U.S. capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by the impact of current year losses that presently do not provide a future tax benefit. 
    
  Changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and the impact of foreign tax credits are expected to be recurring. Depending on various factors, changes from the foregoing items may be favorable or unfavorable in a particular period. 
    
  The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2013 through 2015 are open to examination for federal tax purposes. The Company has several foreign tax jurisdictions that have open tax years from 2009 through 2015. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the company had accrued $6.1 million related to unrecognized tax positions, compared with   $7.8 million   as of December 31, 2015. This net decrease was primarily attributed to changes in contingencies related to international tax. 
    
  Interim income taxes are based on an estimated annualized effective tax rate applied to the respective quarterly periods, adjusted for discrete tax items in the period in which they occur. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the Company can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which it has reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Such differences could have a material impact on the Company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which the Company makes such determination.

Distribution and Marketing 
    
  The Company s independent distributors, also known as Managers and Distributors, market its products to customers through direct selling techniques and sponsor other independent distributors who also market the Company's products to customers. The Company seeks to motivate and provide incentives to its independent distributors by offering high quality products and providing its independent distributors with product support, training seminars, sales conventions, travel programs and financial incentives. 
    
  The Company s products sold in the United States are shipped directly from its manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Spanish Fork, Utah, as well as from its regional warehouses located in Georgia, Ohio and Texas. Many of the Company's international operations maintain warehouse facilities with inventory to supply their independent distributors and customers. However, in foreign markets where it does not maintain warehouse facilities, it has contracted with third-parties to distribute its products and provide support services to its independent sales force of independent distributors. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   244,500   "active independent Distributors and customers" (as defined below). A person who joins the Company s independent sales force begins as an independent distributor.  Many independent distributors sell the Company s products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products themselves. An independent distributor may earn Manager status by attaining certain product sales levels. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   13,200   "active independent Managers" (as defined below) worldwide. In many of the Company's markets, its independent Managers and Distributors are primarily retailers of the Company's products, including practitioners, proprietors of retail stores and other health and wellness specialists. 
    
  In the United States, the Company generally sells its products on a cash or credit card basis. From time to time, the Company's U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. For certain of its international operations, the Company uses independent distribution centers and offers credit terms that are generally consistent with industry standards within each respective country. 
    
  The Company pays sales commissions, or  volume incentives  to its Managers and Distributors based upon the amount of their sales group product purchases. These volume incentives are recorded as an expense in the year earned. The amounts of volume incentives that the Company expensed during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are set forth in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. In addition to the opportunity to receive volume incentives, Managers who attain certain levels of monthly product sales are eligible for additional incentive programs including automobile allowances, sales convention privileges and travel awards. 
    
  Distributor Information 
    
  The Company's revenue is highly dependent upon the number and productivity of its independent Managers and Distributors. Growth in sales volume requires an increase in the productivity and/or growth in the total number of independent Managers and Distributors. 
    
  Within the Company, there are a number of different distributor compensation plans and qualifications, which generate active independent Managers and Distributors with different sales values in the different business segments.  Within the NSP Americas and NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segments, the declines in active independent Managers and Distributors have resulted in declines in sales revenues.  Within Synergy WorldWide, the sales qualifications required for active independent Managers and Distributors varies by market according to local economic factors.  As sales grow in markets with higher qualification values, and decline in those with lower qualification values, the resultant mix change influences the active independent Manager and Distributor counts. As a result, from time-to-time, changes in overall active independent Manager and Distributor counts may not be indicative of actual sales trends for the segment. 
    
  The following table provides information concerning the number of total independent Managers, Distributors and customers by segment, as of the dates indicated:

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Company's principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses, including volume incentives, inventory and raw material purchases, capital assets and funding of international expansion. As of   September 30, 2016  , working capital was   $47.6 million  , compared to   $48.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $40.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents, of which   $36.9 million   was held in foreign markets and may be subject to various withholding taxes and other restrictions related to repatriation before becoming available to be used along with the normal cash flows from operations to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows. 
    
  The Company's net consolidated cash inflows (outflows) are as follows (in thousands): 

Operating Activities   
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating activities provided cash in the amount of   $5.1 million  , compared to   $8.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . Operating cash flows decreased primarily due to the timing of payments and receipts for inventories, liability related to unrecognized tax positions, the effects of foreign exchange as well as the decline in net income between periods, and were partially offset by the timing of payments and receipts for accrued volume incentives, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue, income taxes payable, and other assets.

Investing Activities 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , investing activities used cash in the amount of   $7.9 million  , compared to   $15.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . Capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment, computer systems and software for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were   $7.9 million   and   $17.5 million  , respectively. In 2013, the Company began to significantly reinvest in its information technology systems. Included within this plan is an Oracle ERP implementation program to provide the Company with a single integrated software solution that will integrate the Company s business process on a worldwide basis. The Company anticipates completion of this project by early 2017. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , financing activities provided cash in the amount of   $0.6 million  , compared to using   $6.7 million   of cash for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company used cash to pay dividends in an aggregate amount of   $5.6 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively. 
    
  In November 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a   $20.0 million   share repurchase program beginning January 1, 2015. Such purchases may be made in the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined based on the Company s evaluation of market conditions and other factors and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. The Company will fund future dividends and the share repurchase program through available cash on hand, future cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. During the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no shares repurchased by the Company under the share repurchase program. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining balance available for repurchases under the program was   $13.4 million  . 
    
  The Company has a revolving credit facility agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. with a borrowing limit of   $25.0 million   that matures September 1, 2017. The Company pays interest at LIBOR plus   1.25 percent   on any borrowings on the facility (  1.75 percent   as of   September 30, 2016  ). The Company must pay an annual commitment fee of   0.25 percent   on the unused portion of the commitment. The Company has $16.0 million of unused capacity, under the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  , which will allow the Company to continue making long-term investments in its sales, marketing, science and product development initiatives and overall operations, as well as pursue strategic opportunities as they may arise. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of   $9.0 million   and $2.7 million, respectively, under the revolving credit facility. The increase in the use of the revolving credit facility related to the large build-up of inventory in preparation for operations in China as well as the transition to Oracle. 
    
  The revolving credit agreement contains restrictions on leverage, minimum net income and consecutive quarterly net losses. In addition, the agreement restricts capital expenditures, lease expenditures, other indebtedness, liens on assets, guaranties, loans and advances, and the merger, consolidation and the transfer of assets except in the ordinary course of business.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these debt covenants. 
    
  The Company believes that cash generated from operations, along with available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund its normal operating needs; including dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures, as well as potential business development activity and to meet debt obligations as they become due for the next 12 months, as well as for the foreseeable future. However, among other things, a prolonged economic downturn, a decrease in demand for the Company's products, an unfavorable settlement of its unrecognized tax positions or non-income tax contingencies could adversely affect the Company's long-term liquidity. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions. It bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could have a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee. 

37 

     Table of Contents  

A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is provided in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The Company believes the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The impact and any associated risks on its business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Net sales revenue and related volume incentive expenses are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability is reasonably assured, the amount is fixed and determinable, and title and risk of loss have passed. The amount of the volume incentive is determined based upon the amount of qualifying purchases in a given month. Amounts received for undelivered merchandise are recorded as deferred revenue. 
    
  From time to time, the Company s U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. In addition, for certain of the Company s international operations, the Company offers credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation. Payments to independent Managers and Distributors for sales incentives or rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Payments for sales incentives and rebates are calculated monthly based upon qualifying sales. Membership fees are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the membership, primarily one year.  
    
  A reserve for product returns is recorded based upon historical experience.  The Company allows independent Managers or Distributors to return the unused portion of products within ninety days of purchase if they are not satisfied with the product.  In some of the Company s markets, the requirements to return product are more restrictive. 
    
  Accounts Receivable Allowances 
    
  Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future. This estimated allowance is based primarily on the aging category, historical trends and management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. This reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available. 
    
  Investments 
    
  The Company s available-for-sale investment portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various securities such as state and municipal obligations, U.S. government security funds, short-term deposits and various equity securities. These investments are valued using (a) quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or (b) from significant inputs that are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset. The Company s trading portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various marketable securities that are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 
    
  For equity securities, when assessing whether a decline in fair value below the Company s cost basis is other-than-temporary, the Company considers the fair market value of the security, the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of the cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. Where the Company has determined that it lacks the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery, the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost-or-market, using the first-in, first-out method. The components of inventory cost include raw materials, labor and overhead. To estimate any necessary obsolescence or lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments, various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow-moving inventories, non-conforming inventories, expiration dates, current and future product demand, production planning and market conditions. 
    
  Self-Insurance Liabilities 
    
  Similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested, the Company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury. The Company has a wholly-owned captive insurance company to provide it with product liability insurance coverage. The Company has  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

accrued an amount that it believes is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based on the Company s history of such claims. However, there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient, nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on the Company s business prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  The Company self-insures for certain employee medical benefits. The recorded liabilities for self-insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted. The liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported. Actual experience, including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation, could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  The Company reviews its long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. It may use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related assets or groups of assets over their remaining lives in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. An impairment loss is calculated by determining the difference between the carrying values and the fair values of these assets. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company received $0 and $1.3 million, respectively, in net proceeds from the sales of its fixed assets in Venezuela, which is included in the Company's results from discontinued operations. 
    
  Incentive Trip Accrual 
    
  The Company accrues for expenses associated with its direct sales program, which rewards independent Managers and Distributors with paid attendance for incentive trips, including Company conventions and meetings. Expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned. It specifically analyzes incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual. Actual results could generate liabilities more or less than the amounts recorded. 
     
  Contingencies 
    
  The Company is involved in certain legal proceedings. When a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or non-income tax contingencies and when such loss can be reasonably estimated with a range, it records its best estimate within the range related to the contingency. If there is no best estimate, it records the minimum of the range. As additional information becomes available, it assesses the potential liability related to the contingency and revises the estimates. Revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect its results of operations in the period of adjustment. The Company's contingencies are discussed in further detail in Note 10,  Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes of its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, of Item 1, Part 1 of this report. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingent reserves reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. It is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the Company s consolidated income tax expense. 
    
  Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating the Company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company develops assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income, and are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses. Valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by the Company when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future. 
    
  Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

39 

     Table of Contents  

The calculation of the Company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global operations. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company recognizes all share-based payments to Directors and employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their grant-date fair values. It records compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the vesting period of the stock options based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant. The estimated forfeiture rate is based upon historical experience. 

Item 3                  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The Company conducts business in several countries and intends to continue to grow its international operations. Net sales revenue, operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency. In addition, its operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social, political and economic conditions inherent in international operations, including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where it has operations, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately 56.3 percent of the Company's net sales revenue and approximately 55.3 percent of its operating expenses were realized outside of the United States. Inventory purchases are transacted primarily in U.S. dollars from vendors located in the United States. The local currency of each international subsidiary is generally the functional currency. The Company conducts business in multiple currencies with exchange rates that are not on a one-to-one relationship with the U.S. dollar. All revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported. Therefore, the Company's operating results will be positively or negatively affected by a weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to another fluctuating currency. Given the uncertainty and diversity of exchange rate fluctuations, the Company cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on its future business, product pricing, results of operations or financial condition, but it has provided consolidated sensitivity analyses below of functional currency/reporting currency exchange rate risks. Changes in various currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which it sells its products. The Company regularly monitors its foreign currency risks and periodically takes measures to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its operating results. The Company does not use derivative instruments for hedging, trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Additional discussion of the impact on the effect of currency fluctuations has been included in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Part I, Item 2 of this report. 
    
  The following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of the Company s net sales revenue, costs and expenses and operating income in connection with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar (its reporting currency) by 10%, 15%, and 25% against every other fluctuating functional currency in which it conducts business.  The Company notes that its individual net sales revenue, cost and expense components and its operating income were equally sensitive to increases in the strength of the U.S. dollar against every other fluctuating currency in which it conducts business.

Certain of the Company s operations, including Russia and Ukraine, are served by a U.S. subsidiary through third-party entities, for which all business is conducted in U.S. dollars. Although changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble or the Ukrainian hryvnia do not result in currency fluctuations within its financial statements, a weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to these other currencies can significantly affect the prices of its products and the purchasing power of its independent Managers, Distributors and customers within these markets. As a result of the current tension between Russia and Ukraine, economic pressures resulting from lower oil prices, and resultant government sanctions, the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia have weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar, impacting net sales in this market.  Should the conflict continue to escalate, exchanges rates for the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia could weaken further against the U.S. dollar, further impacting net sales in these markets. 
    
  The following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of the Company s financial assets and liabilities by those balance sheet line items that are subject to exchange rate risk, together with the total gain or loss from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to its various fluctuating functional currencies.  The sensitivity of its financial assets and liabilities, taken by balance sheet line items, is somewhat less than the sensitivity of its operating income to increases in the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to other fluctuating currencies in which it conducts business.

Exchange rate sensitivity of the Balance Sheet financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands) 

The following table sets forth the local currencies other than the U.S. dollar in which the Company s assets that are subject to exchange rate risk were denominated as of   September 30, 2016  , and exceeded $1 million upon translation into U.S. dollars.  None of its liabilities that are denominated in a local currency other than the U.S. dollar and that are subject to exchange rate risk exceeded $1 million upon translation into U.S. dollars. The Company uses the spot exchange rate for translating balance sheet items from local currencies into its reporting currency.  The respective spot exchange rate for each such local currency meeting the foregoing thresholds is provided in the table as well. 
    
  Translation of Balance Sheet Amounts Denominated in Local Currency as of   September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands) 

Finally, the following table sets forth the annual weighted average of fluctuating currency exchange rates of each of the local currencies per one U.S. dollar for each of the local currencies in which annualized net sales revenue would exceed $10.0 million during any of the two periods presented.  The Company uses the annual average exchange rate for translating items from the statement of operations from local currencies into the Company s reporting currency.

The local currency of the foreign subsidiaries is used as the functional currency, except for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies or where the Company s operations are served by a U.S. based subsidiary (for example, Russia and Ukraine). The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year-end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each year for the results of operations. Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The primary objectives of the Company's investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. These objectives are accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities. On   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investments of   $1.8 million  . A hypothetical 1.0 percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the Company's liquidity, financial position or results of operations. 

Item 4.               CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.                           LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  The Company is party to various legal proceedings. Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, or their resulting effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows as litigation and related matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows for the period in which the ruling occurs and/or future periods. 

Item 1A.                  RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed under the heading  Risk Factors  in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year and in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed during the current fiscal year, which could materially affect the Company's business or consolidated financial statements, results of operations, and cash flows. Additional risks not currently known, or risks that are currently believed to be not material, may also impair business operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to the Company's risk factors set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2015 fiscal year and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

Item 2.                           UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  In November 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a   $20.0 million   share repurchase program beginning January 1, 2015. Such purchases may be made in the open market, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined based on the Company s evaluation of market conditions and other factors and the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time. There were no shares repurchased by the Company during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining balance available for repurchases under the program was   $13.4 million  .

Exhibit 99.1 
    
  Compliance Committee Charter 
    
  I.   Purpose  . The purpose of the Compliance Committee ( Committee ) of the Board of Directors of Nature s Sunshine Products, Inc. (the  Company ) shall be to oversee the Company s efforts with respect to operational compliance.   Operational Compliance  shall be defined to include: distributor compliance and direct selling best practices; employee compliance, including code of conduct and other mandated trainings; product and product distribution regulatory compliance, including adherence to FTC, FDA and other similar regulatory bodies  mandates; and non-financial, whistleblower reports.  For avoidance of doubt, it shall not include FCPA. 
    
  II.   Committee Structure 
    
  The Committee shall consist of at least three directors, one of whom shall be the Chair of the Company s Audit Committee. A majority of the members of the Committee shall meet the independence and experience requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), as affirmatively determined by the Company s Board of Directors ( Board ). The Board may, at any time and in its complete discretion, replace a Committee member. 
    
  III.   Meetings 
    
  The Committee shall meet as often as it determines, but not less frequently than quarterly. The Committee shall maintain minutes and other relevant documentation of all its meetings. 
    
  IV.   Committee Authority and Responsibilities 
    
  A. The Committee shall oversee the Company s efforts with respect to Operational Compliance, including relevant Company policies and procedures. In this regard, the Committee may, without limitation: 
    
  i. Review periodically and make recommendations to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company s Operational Compliance practices generally and the Company s policies and procedures for ensuring Operational Compliance as established by management and the Board, including without limitation the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Compliance Program; 
    
  ii. Oversee implementation by management of the Company s policies and procedures for ensuring Operational Compliance as established by management and the 
  Board, including without limitation the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Compliance Program; 
    
  iii. Meet with and receive and review reports from the Company s Chief Compliance Officer concerning Operational Compliance matters (other than those relating to FCPA, the Company s financial statements and financial reporting obligations and any accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, which are within the purview of the Audit Committee), including without limitation complaints received from internal and external sources; 
    
  iv. Promptly refer all compliance matters regarding matters relating to FCPA, accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters to the Audit Committee and otherwise with respect to all other compliance matters, promptly notify the Chair of the Audit Committee of the initiation of any such significant compliance matters and keep the Chair of the Audit Committee reasonably apprised of the status of any such significant compliance matters; 
    
  v. Authorize or oversee investigations into any matters within the Committee s scope of responsibility as described in this charter or as otherwise may be subsequently delegated to the Committee by the Board, with the power to retain independent counsel and other advisors and experts to assist the Committee if deemed appropriate; 
    
  vi. Review and monitor evolving industry practices and trends in order to recommend enhancements to the Company s Operational Compliance practices generally and the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Compliance Program specifically; and 
    
  vii. Perform any other activities consistent with this Charter, the Company s certificate of incorporation, the Company s Bylaws and governing law, as the Committee of the Board deems necessary or appropriate. 
    
  B. The Committee shall have the authority to conduct or authorize investigations into any matter within the Committee s scope of responsibilities. The Committee shall be empowered to retain, without Board approval, independent legal, accounting, and other advisors as it deems necessary to carry out its duties. The Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, to compensate outside legal counsel or any other advisors employed by the Committee, and to pay ordinary Committee administrative expenses that are necessary and appropriate in carrying out its duties. 
    
  C. The Committee shall have the authority to institute special investigations with full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of the Company as and when the Committee determines appropriate and necessary for the conduct of its duties. 
  D. The Committee shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter on an annual basis and submit proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Committee has the powers and responsibilities delineated in this Charter. 
    
  E. Although the Committee may initiate compliance audits or investigations, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct compliance audits in the ordinary course of the Company s business, to conduct investigations, or to assure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and ethical programs and policies as established by management and the Board, including without limitation the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Compliance Program. Rather, the Committee will oversee the relevant work of the Company s Chief Compliance Officer and will receive reports from the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel and other members of management about issues that may arise concerning the Company s Operational Compliance as established by management and the Board. Any communication between the Committee and legal counsel in the course of obtaining legal advice will be considered privileged communications of the Company and the Committee will take all necessary steps to preserve the privileged nature of those communications.
