1. General 
    
  Colfax Corporation (the  Company  or  Colfax ) is a diversified global industrial manufacturing and engineering company that provides gas- and fluid-handling and fabrication technology products and services to customers around the world principally under the Howden, ESAB and Colfax Fluid Handling brand names. 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements.  
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015   is derived from the Company s audited financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the SEC s rules and regulations for interim financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ), filed with the SEC on   February 16, 2016  . 
    
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, due to government controls, has restricted the Company s Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, other government-imposed restrictions affecting labor, production, and distribution are prohibiting the Company from controlling key operating decisions. These circumstances have caused the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its Venezuelan operations. Therefore, the Company has deconsolidated the financial statements of its Venezuelan operations as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recorded a charge of   $2.4 million   in Selling, general and administrative expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , substantially all of which related to accumulated foreign currency translation charges previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Due to loss of control, the Company has applied the cost method of accounting for its Venezuelan operations as of September 30, 2016. The Company s Venezuelan operations represented   less than 1%   of the Company s net assets, revenues and operating income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in preparing its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
    
  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the full year. Quarterly results are affected by seasonal variations in the Company s business. Historically, our gas- and fluid-handling shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, all of our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July and August and December holiday seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations. 

2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). ASU No. 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance affects entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services, and supersedes prior GAAP guidance, namely Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605   Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 is to be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective

    COLFAX CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   (Unaudited) 

Date , which delayed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not prior to the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the FASB issued three additional Accounting Standards Updates that clarify the original guidance as laid out in ASU No. 2014-09. These Accounting Standards Updates focus on clarification of principal versus agent considerations, performance obligations and licensing, and provides for application of certain practical expedients and narrow-scope improvements. The Company plans to apply these Accounting Standards Updates on a full retrospective basis as of January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330)    Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU No. 2015-11 ).  ASU No. 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory that is measured using the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and is to be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2015-11 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805)   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  ( ASU No. 2015-16 ). ASU No. 2015-16 aims to simplify measurement period adjustments resulting from business combinations by requiring that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, will be recorded in the same period s financial statements as the measurement period adjustment. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU No. 2015-16. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   did not have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3,  Acquisitions  for measurement period adjustments made during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , related to acquisitions that occurred during the   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ). ASU No. 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations attributable to most leases but also recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU No. 2016-09 ). ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2016-09 aims to simplify the accounting for shared-based payment accounting by recording all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before they can be recognized, and provides the option to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to continue to estimate the amount of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The effect for excess tax benefits not previously recognized will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings pursuant to a modified retrospective adoption method. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be accounted for as discrete items in the period the stock awards vest or otherwise are settled. Further, the guidance will require that excess tax benefits be presented as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows consistent with other income tax cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 also increases share based withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions without causing the award to be classified as a liability. All provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 must be adopted in the same period. The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2016-09 in the annual period beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU No. 2016-13 ). ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold under current U.S. GAAP and broadens the information an entity must consider when developing its expected credit loss estimates to include forecast information that affects the collectibility of the reported amount. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 203)  ( ASU No. 2016-15 ).  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues and clarifies their presentation and classification in the Statement of Cash Flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-15 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

3. Acquisitions 
    
  The Company completed the acquisitions of the Roots   TM    blowers and compressors business unit, also known as Industrial Air   Gas Technologies, from GE Oil   Gas ( Roots ) on   June 30, 2015  , and   Simsmart Technologies, Inc  . ( Simsmart ) on   October 5, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company adjusted provisional amounts with respect to these acquisitions that were recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The aggregate adjustments, primarily attributable to the Company s valuation of inventory and revision of estimates based on additional information obtained for a specific environmental reserve, increased the Goodwill balance by   $1.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company continues to evaluate the acquired assets and liabilities assumed for Simsmart during the measurement period as certain valuations and studies have yet to be finalized, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment once the detailed analyses are complete. 

4. Net Income Per Share 
    
  Net income per share was computed as follows: 

The weighted-average computation of the dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares of Common stock under the treasury stock method for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 25, 2015   excludes approximately   5.2 million   and   3.2 million   of outstanding stock-based compensation awards, respectively, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The weighted-average computation of the dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares of Common stock under the treasury stock method for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 25, 2015   excludes approximately   5.1 million   and   2.5 million   of outstanding stock-based compensation awards, respectively, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

5. Income Taxes  
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , Income before income taxes was   $43.7 million  , while the Provision for income taxes was   $11.5 million  , and the effective tax rate was   26.3%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Income before income taxes was   $147.4 million  , while the Provision for income taxes was   $45.1 million  , and the effective tax rate was

    COLFAX CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   (Unaudited) 

30.6%  . The effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to international taxes, which are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized in   2016  . 
    
  During the   three months ended September 25, 2015  , Income before income taxes was   $34.7 million  , while the Provision for income taxes was   $11.2 million   and the effective tax rate was   32.1%  . During the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , Income before income taxes was   $182.4 million  , while the Provision for income taxes was   $43.8 million  , and the effective tax rate was   24.0%  . The effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to international tax rates, which are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit was not expected to be recognized in   2015  . The Provision for income taxes for the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   includes a tax benefit of   $13.0 million   associated with the resolution of certain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. 

6. Equity 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On October 11, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $100.0 million   of the Company s Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is authorized until December 31, 2016. The timing and amount of shares repurchased is to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors.  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1,000,000   shares of its Common stock in open market transactions for approximately   $20.8 million   under a plan complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by the Company s Board of Directors is approximately   $52 million  . 
    
  Share-Based Payments 
    
  On May 13, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Colfax Corporation 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ). Under the 2016 Plan, the Company has reserved up to   10.5 million   shares of Common stock for potential issuance as stock-based compensation. Upon approval of the 2016 Plan, awards are no longer granted under the previously existing Colfax Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on April 2, 2012.

Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the program limit. On August 16, 2016, the receivables financing facility program limit decreased by   $15 million   from   $95 million   to   $80 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the total outstanding borrowings under the receivables financing facility were   $76.6 million   and the interest rate was   1.39%  . The scheduled termination date for the receivables financing facility is December 20, 2016 and may be extended from time to time. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Accrued Restructuring Liability 
    
  The Company s restructuring programs include a series of restructuring actions to reduce the structural costs of the Company. 
    
  A summary of the activity in the Company s restructuring liability included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows: 

(1)    Includes severance and other termination benefits, including outplacement services. The Company recognizes the cost of involuntary termination benefits at the communication date or ratably over any remaining expected future service period. Voluntary termination benefits are recognized as a liability and an expense when employees accept the offer and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
   (2)    Includes the cost of relocating associates, relocating equipment and lease termination expense in connection with the closure of facilities. 
   (3)    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $14.7 million   and   $0.4 million   of the Company s restructuring liability was included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively.

11  . Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The carrying values of financial instruments, including Trade receivables and Accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The estimated fair value of the Company s debt of   $1.4 billion   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was based on current interest rates for similar types of borrowings and is in Level Two of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could be realized as of the balance sheet date or that will be realized in the future. 
    
  A summary of the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value for each fair value hierarchy level for the periods presented is as follows: 

There were no transfers in or out of Level One, Two or Three during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

12  . Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  For further description of the Company s litigation and contingencies, reference is made to Note 15,  Commitments and Contingencies  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Asbestos and Other Product Liability Contingencies 
    
  Claims activity since December 31 related to asbestos claims is as follows   (1)   : 

(1)    Excludes claims filed by one legal firm that have been  administratively dismissed.  
   (2)    Claims filed include all asbestos claims for which notification has been received or a file has been opened. 
   (3)    Claims resolved include all asbestos claims that have been settled, dismissed or that are in the process of being settled or dismissed based upon agreements or understandings in place with counsel for the claimants. 
    
  The Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets included the following amounts related to asbestos-related litigation: 

(1)    Included in Other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   (2)    Included in Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   (3)    Represents the current portion of reserves for probable and reasonably estimable asbestos-related liability cost that the Company believes its subsidiaries will pay through the next   15   years, overpayments by certain insurers and unpaid legal costs related to defending themselves against asbestos-related liability claims and legal action against the Company s insurers, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   (4)    Included in Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  On September 12, 2016, the Delaware Supreme Court, after receiving responses from the New York Court of Appeals on questions certified to it, affirmed prior rulings that an  all sums  allocation applies to the subsidiary s insurance policies and that the subsidiary has rights under the excess insurance policies issued to a former owner of the business. The Court also ruled on other matters including specific determinations of coverage for defense costs under the excess policies. The net result of the ruling is an adjustment to the Company s expected future recoveries, resulting in an   $8.2 million   reduction to the net recoverable insurance asset recorded as a charge to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The estimated future expected recovery rate may change over time as these claims are fully settled, which may result in periodic adjustments impacting our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Certain matters, including potential interest which could be awarded to the subsidiary, are subject to further rulings from the Delaware courts. While the outcome is uncertain, none of these matters is expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  
    
  The Delaware Supreme Court s ruling is also expected to result in the receipt from excess insurers of approximately $88 million in unreimbursed costs funded by the subsidiary in defense and settlement of asbestos claims, although the timing of cash  
  
   19 

    COLFAX CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
   (Unaudited) 

receipts remains uncertain.   It also is expected to reduce significantly the extent to which the Company is required to fund future defense and settlement costs, compared to levels experienced prior to the ruling.  
    
  The estimated asbestos-related liabilities of the other subsidiary have been increased   $8.0 million   due to higher estimated settlement values per claim, and the related insurance asset has been increased   $6.1 million  , resulting in a net charge to Selling, general and administrative expense of   $1.9 million   for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Management s analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.  
    
  Other Litigation Matters 
    
  The Lincoln Electric Company and Lincoln Global, Inc. (collectively,  Lincoln Electric ) filed suit against The ESAB Group, Inc. and ESAB AB in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of certain patents allegedly owned by Lincoln Electric. The complaint, as amended, seeks undisclosed damages plus interest, an award of attorneys  fees and expenses, and injunctive relief. The defendants answered the complaint, denying Lincoln Electric s infringement allegations and asserting affirmative defenses, on October 20, 2015. The litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flow of the Company. The defendants are vigorously defending against the claims.     
    
  The Company is also involved in various other pending legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of the Company s business. None of these legal proceedings are expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flow of the Company. With respect to these proceedings and the litigation and claims described in the preceding paragraphs, management of the Company believes that it will either prevail, has adequate insurance coverage or has established appropriate accruals to cover potential liabilities. Any costs that management estimates may be paid related to these proceedings or claims are accrued when the liability is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. There can be no assurance, however, as to the ultimate outcome of any of these matters, and if all or substantially all of these legal proceedings were to be determined adverse to the Company, there could be a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.  

13. Segment Information 
    
  The Company conducts its operations through three operating segments: gas handling, fluid handling and fabrication technology.  The gas-handling and fluid-handling operating segments are aggregated into a single reportable segment.  A description of the Company s reportable segments is as follows:  

Gas and Fluid Handling   - a global supplier of a broad range of gas- and fluid-handling products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, pumps, fluid-handling systems, controls and specialty valves, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other end markets; and  

Fabrication Technology   -     a global supplier of welding equipment and consumables, cutting equipment and consumables and automated welding and cutting systems. 
       
  Certain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading  Corporate and other.  The Company s management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income (loss) before Restructuring and other related charges.

Overview 
    
  We report our operations through the following reportable segments:  

Gas and Fluid Handling   - a global supplier of a broad range of gas- and fluid-handling products, including heavy-duty centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls and specialty valves, which serves customers in the power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other end markets; and  
                
    Fabrication Technology   -     a global supplier of welding equipment and consumables, cutting equipment and consumables and automated welding and cutting systems. 
       
  Certain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading  Corporate and other.   
    
  Colfax has a global geographic footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.   
    
  We employ a comprehensive set of tools that we refer to as the Colfax Business System ( CBS ). CBS is our business management system. It is a repeatable, teachable process that we use to create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. CBS provides the tools and techniques to ensure that we are continuously improving our ability to meet or exceed customer requirements on a consistent basis. 

Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. Our management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income before Restructuring and other related charges.   

Items Affecting Comparability of Reported Results 
    
  The comparability of our operating results for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the comparable   2015   period is affected by the following additional significant items: 
    
  Strategic Acquisitions    
    
  We complement our organic growth plans with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results. As a consequence, we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the gas- and fluid-handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions represents the change in sales due to the following acquisitions: 
    
  Gas and Fluid Handling 
    
  On   June 30, 2015  , Colfax completed the acquisition of the Roots   TM    blowers and compressors business unit, also known as Industrial Air   Gas Technologies, from GE Oil   Gas (the  Roots Acquisition ) for cash consideration of   $180.7 million  , inclusive of a purchase price settlement in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acquisition builds on Howden s global strength in compressors and blowers and adds important application expertise and product solutions to the portfolio. 
    
  On   October 5, 2015  , Colfax completed the acquisition of Simsmart Technologies, Inc. for cash consideration of   $15.3 million  , net of cash acquired. Simsmart provides software and services to control ventilation conditions and increase fan efficiency. The acquisition of Simsmart expands the Howden product portfolio for mining and other challenging ventilation conditions. 
  
   24 

Foreign Currency Fluctuations 
    
  A significant portion of our Net sales, approximately   75%   and   72%   for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion. Changes in foreign exchange rates have reduced Net sales by approximately   3%   and   4%   for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , changes in foreign exchange rates also reduced Income before income taxes by approximately   7%   and    6%  , respectively. The changes in foreign exchange rates since   December 31, 2015   decreased net assets by approximately 5%, due primarily to significant intangible assets denominated in British pounds. 
    
  During the   third quarter of 2016  , we determined that an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, due to government controls, restricted our Venezuelan operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, other government-imposed restrictions affecting labor, production, and distribution are prohibiting the Company from controlling key operating decisions. These circumstances have caused the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria of control in order to continue consolidating its Venezuelan operations. Therefore, we have deconsolidated the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result of the deconsolidation, we recorded a charge of   $2.4 million   in Selling, general and administrative expense for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , substantially all of which related to accumulated foreign currency translation charges previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Due to loss of control, we have applied the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations as of September 30, 2016. Our Venezuelan operations represented   less than 1%   of our net assets, revenues and operating income for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Historically, our gas- and fluid-handling shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, all of our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July and August and December holiday seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.  

25 

Sales, Orders and Backlog 
    
  Our Net sales decreased from   $969.1 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $879.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  .  Our Net sales decreased from   $2,905.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   to   $2,713.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The following tables present the components of changes in our consolidated Net sales and, for our gas- and fluid-handling segment, orders and order backlog: 

(1)    Represents contracts for products or services, net of cancellations for the period, for our gas- and fluid-handling segment. 
   (2)    Excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, thus providing a measure of growth due to factors such as price, product mix and volume; backlog includes cancellations of orders from prior years. 
   (3)    Represents the incremental sales, orders and order backlog as a result of our acquisitions. 
   (4)    Represents the difference between prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at the actual prior year foreign exchange rates and prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates. 
    
  The decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   was attributable to decreases of   $37.4 million   in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and   $28.5 million   in our fabrication technology segment. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment increased during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   due to increases in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and mining end markets, partially offset by declines in the power generation, marine and general industrial and other industrial end markets. 
    
  The decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   was attributable to decreases of   $59.8 million   in our fabrication technology segment and   $65.8 million   in our gas- and fluid-handling segment. Orders, net of cancellations, from existing businesses for our gas- and fluid-handling segment decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   due to declines in the power generation, oil, gas, and petrochemical, marine and general industrial and other end markets, partially offset by an increase in the mining end market. 

26 

Business Segments 
    
  As discussed further above, we report results in two reportable segments: gas and fluid handling and fabrication technology.  
    
  Gas and Fluid Handling 
    
  We design, manufacture, install and maintain gas- and fluid-handling products for use in a wide range of markets, including power generation, oil, gas and petrochemical, mining, marine (including defense) and general industrial and other. Our gas-handling products are principally marketed under the Howden brand name. Howden s primary products are heavy-duty fans, rotary heat exchangers and compressors. The fans and heat exchangers are used in coal-fired and other types of power stations, both in combustion and emissions control applications, underground mines, steel sintering plants and other industrial facilities that require movement of large volumes of air in harsh applications. Howden s compressors are mainly used in the oil, gas and petrochemical end market. Our fluid-handling products are marketed by Colfax Fluid Handling under a portfolio of brands including Allweiler and Imo. Colfax Fluid Handling is a supplier of a broad range of fluid-handling products, including pumps, fluid-handling systems and controls, and specialty valves.  
    
  The following table summarizes selected financial data for our gas- and fluid-handling segment:  

The   $37.4 million   Net sales decrease due to existing businesses during the   third quarter of 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter of 2015  , as discussed and defined under  Sales, Orders and Backlog  above, was due to declines in our power generation, general industrial and other, oil, gas, and petrochemical, and marine end markets, partially offset by growth in our mining end market. Acquisition-related growth contributed   $1.3 million   of Net sales in the   third quarter of 2016  . Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on Net sales of   $12.7 million  . Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in the   third quarter of 2016   reflecting the impact of lower volumes and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by cost saving initiatives and acquisition-related growth. Gross profit for the   third quarter of 2016   also included $3.2 million of inventory charges as a result of cyclical downturn in certain end markets. Restructuring and other related charges increased during the   third quarter of 2016   primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs to reduce our cost structure in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. Selling, general and administrative expense for the   third quarter of 2016   decreased compared to the   third quarter of 2015   primarily due to cost control activities and restructuring savings, and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by a   $1.9 million   loss on deconsolidation of a Venezuelan subsidiary. Selling, general and administrative expense for the   third quarter of 2015   includes   $8.1 million   of charges associated with uncollectible accounts of a specific customer in South America,   $2.8 million   of asset impairment charges,   $3.3 million   of transaction costs associated with the Roots Acquisition, and higher charges for revaluation of net asbestos-related liabilities. 
    
  The   $65.8 million   Net sales decrease due to existing businesses during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , was due to declines in our power generation, marine, mining and general industrial and other end markets, partially offset by growth in our oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets. Acquisition-related growth contributed   $51.6 million   of Net sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on Net sales of   $45.2 million  . Gross profit decreased in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflecting the impact of changes in volumes, foreign exchange rates, the inventory write-down discussed previously and a $3 million provision  
  
   27 

for losses on customer contracts recorded in the second quarter. The decrease was partially offset by acquisition-related growth and a   $1.1 million   insurance recovery associated with a product liability claim recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Gross profit margin decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   due to decremental margins on lower volumes, contractual loss provisions, the inventory write-down and higher warranty costs. Restructuring and other related charges increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs. Selling, general and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates and cost control activities. The decrease was partially offset by acquisition-related growth and the loss on deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation discussed previously, and a   $1.4 million   second quarter impairment charge on long-lived assets at a specific North American business. Also contributing to the year over year change were incremental charges in the   third quarter of 2015   discussed previously.  
    
  During the   third quarter of 2016  , a Delaware Supreme Court ruling on September 12, 2016, affirmed prior rulings that an  all sums  allocation applies to a specific subsidiary s insurance policies and that the subsidiary has rights under the excess insurance policies issued to a former owner of the business. The Court also ruled on other matters including specific determinations of coverage for defense costs under the excess policies. The net result of the ruling is an adjustment to our expected future recoveries, resulting in an   $8.2 million   reduction to the net recoverable insurance asset recorded as a charge to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Fabrication Technology 
    
  We formulate, develop, manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys. Our fabrication technology products are marketed under several brand names, most notably ESAB and Victor, which we believe are well known in the international cutting and welding industry.  ESAB s comprehensive range of cutting and welding consumables includes electrodes, cored and solid wire and fluxes. ESAB s fabrication technology equipment ranges from portable welding machines to large customized cutting and automated welding systems. Products are sold into a wide range of end markets, including oil, gas and petrochemicals, power generation, wind power, shipbuilding, pipelines, mobile/off-highway equipment and mining. 
    
  The following table summarizes selected financial data for our fabrication technology segment: 

The   $28.5 million   Net sales decrease due to existing businesses during the   third quarter of 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter of 2015  , was primarily the result of decreases in volumes in North America, Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Russia and Asia. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on Net sales of   $12.6 million  . Gross profit decreased in the   third quarter of 2016   primarily due to the impact of lower volumes and changes in foreign exchange rates. Gross profit margin increased during the   third quarter of 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter of 2015   due to the positive impact of cost control activities. Restructuring and other related charges is consistent with the prior year as we continue to execute on programs to reduce our cost structure in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense in the   third quarter of 2016   was primarily due to cost control activities and restructuring savings, and to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by incremental legal costs of   $3.7 million   related to defense of alleged patent infringement and a   $0.5 million   loss on deconsolidation of our Venezuelan  
  
   28 

operation. Selling, general and administrative expense for the   third quarter of 2015   included   $2.8 million   of incremental charges associated with impairment of an intangible asset and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
    
  The   $59.8 million   Net sales decrease due to existing businesses during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , was primarily the result of a decrease in filler metal volumes in the Americas and Asia, and equipment volumes in North America, partially offset by three more business days in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than the comparable 2015 period. Business days are more significant to fabrication technology where more products are sold from finished stock. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on Net sales of   $73.1 million  . Gross profit decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the impact of lower overall volumes and changes in foreign exchange rates partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Gross profit margin increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   primarily due to decreased raw material costs and the positive impact of cost control activities. Restructuring and other related charges increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to the accelerated cost reduction programs mentioned previously. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   as a result of savings from our cost reduction programs. These reductions were partially offset by net legal costs of   $5.9 million   related to defense of alleged patent infringement, the loss on deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation discussed previously. The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   also includes  asset impairment charges of $2.3 million associated with the expected exit of a specific South American business and approximately $3.0 million of charges associated with uncollectible accounts of specific customers recorded during the first quarter of 2016.  

Gross Profit - Total Company 

The   $20.5 million   decrease in Gross profit during the   third quarter of 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter of 2015   was attributable to a decreases of   $18.2 million   in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and   $2.3 million   in our fabrication technology segment. The   $61.3 million   decrease in Gross profit during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   was attributable to decreases of   $43.1 million   in our gas- and fluid-handling segment and   $18.2 million   in our fabrication technology segment. Gross profit decreased during the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter and nine months ended September 25, 2015   primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates, lower overall volumes and incremental inventory charges in the gas and fluid handling segment. Changes in foreign exchange rates during the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   had a   $7.2 million   and   $32.9 million   negative impact on Gross profit in comparison to the   third quarter and nine months ended September 25, 2015  . The cost savings and lower raw material prices in fabrication technology were more than sufficient to offset the impact of lower margins within gas- and fluid-handling and negative foreign exchange impact during the   third quarter of 2016  , resulting in an increase in gross profit margin for the quarter as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . Gross profit margin was consistent for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   as the increase at fabrication technology was offset by the decrease in gas- and fluid-handling for reasons discussed previously. Gross profit for the   third quarter and nine months ended September 25, 2015   also included various incremental charges discussed previously. 
  
   29 

Operating Expenses - Total Company 

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by   $37.7 million   and   $45.7 million   during the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   in comparison to the   third quarter and nine months ended September 25, 2015  .  The decreases in Selling, general and administrative expense are attributable to accelerated cost reduction programs in both segments and the impact of foreign exchange rates. These reductions were partially offset by acquisition related growth in our gas- and fluid-handling segment, incremental charges associated with uncollectible accounts of specific customers, asset impairments in specific operations in North and South America, legal costs related to defense of alleged patent infringement, and a $2.4 million loss on deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations discussed previously. An   $8.2 million   net recoverable insurance asset reduction was recorded in the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to ongoing litigation for a specific subsidiary in our gas- and fluid-handling segment as discussed previously. Restructuring and other related charges increased during the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to accelerated cost reduction programs to reduce our cost structure in response to the current challenging, cyclical economic conditions. 
    
  Interest Expense - Total Company 

The decrease in Interest expense during the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower foreign currency charges, interest income on a tax refund received in the current quarter, and lower amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility in the prior year, all of which contributed approximate equal decreases to the change. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Interest expense declined as compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , primarily due to lower non-cash interest expense of   $7.5 million   due to the refinancing of our credit facility. Also contributing to the decline were lower foreign currency charges and the tax refund discussed previously. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes - Total Company  
    
  The effective tax rate for the   third quarter of 2016   was   26.3%  , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized in   2016  . The effective tax rate for the   third quarter of 2015   was   32.1%  , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to international tax rates, which are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit was not expected to be recognized in 2015.   
    
  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   30.6%  , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. tax rate and the impact of the U.S. based   Asbestos coverage adjustment  , offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized in   2016  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   was   24.0%  , which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit of   $13.0 million   associated with the resolution of certain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and international tax rates, which are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit was not expected to be recognized in 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 
    
  We have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, funding of acquisitions, capital expenditures, asbestos-related cash outflows and funding of our pension plans. If determined appropriate for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity. 
    
  Equity Capital 
    
  On October 11, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $100.0 million   of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is authorized until  
  
   31 

December 31, 2016. The timing and amount of shares repurchased is to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   1,000,000   shares of the Company s Common stock under a plan complying with Rule 10b5-1. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by the Company s Board of Directors is approximately   $52 million  . 
    
  Borrowing Arrangements 
    
  On June 5, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement by and among the Company, as the borrower, certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company identified therein, as guarantors, each of the lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, swing line lender and global coordinator, to extend the life of our borrowing facility to five years, adjust principal amortization, and modify the underlying covenants and security requirements.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the Credit Agreement was   1.92%  , excluding accretion of original issue discount and deferred financing fees, and there was   $779.4 million   available on the revolving credit facility.  
    
  We are also party to letter of credit facilities with total capacity of   $756.8 million  . Total letters of credit of   $352.5 million   were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company is party to a receivables financing facility through a wholly-owned, special purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary     which purchases trade receivables from certain of the Company s subsidiaries on an ongoing basis and pledges them to support its obligation as borrower under the receivables financing facility. This special purpose subsidiary has a separate legal existence from its parent and its assets are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the selling subsidiaries or any other member of the consolidated group. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the program limit. On August 16, 2016, the program limit for the receivables financing facility decrased by $15 million from $95 million to   $80 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the total outstanding borrowings under the receivables financing facility were   $76.6 million   and the interest rate was   1.39%  . The scheduled termination date for the receivables financing facility is December 20, 2016 and may be extended from time to time. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that the Company views as materially constraining to the activities of its business. 
    
  Certain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt or liens, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets or make certain investments. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio, as defined therein, of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 and minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein, of 3.0 to 1.0, measured at the end of each quarter.  The Credit Agreement contains various events of default (including failure to comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement and related agreements) and upon an event of default the lenders may, subject to various customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolver. The Company is in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . We believe that our sources of liquidity, including the Credit Agreement, are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months. 

Cash Flows 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $191.7 million   of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of   $5.8 million   from   $197.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:   

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding and asbestos-related costs. Changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below. 

Net cash received or paid for asbestos-related costs, net of insurance proceeds, including the disposition of claims, defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers, creates variability in our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows of   $27.9 million   and   $10.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , respectively.   
                
    Funding requirements of our defined benefit plans, including pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , cash contributions for defined benefit plans were   $24.8 million   and   $32.6 million  , respectively.  
                 
    Changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented. We define working capital as Trade receivables, net and Inventories, net reduced by Accounts payable. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net working capital consumed cash of   $93.2 million  , before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to a decrease in payables and an increase in receivables, partially offset by a decrease in inventory. The principal contributor to the increase in working capital was lower billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
                
    During the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  , net working capital consumed cash of $56.2 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventory levels, partially offset by an increase in payables. The principal contributors to the increase in working capital in 2015 were higher inventory and receivable levels within the fabrication technology segment, and an increase in receivables in our gas- and fluid-handling segment.  
                
    Increased working capital in both years reflect normal seasonal changes. 
     
   32 

The change in cash flows from investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 25, 2015   is primarily due to cash outflows for the Roots acquisition during the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  Cash flows from financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were impacted by the repurchase of   1,000,000   shares of the Company s Common stock for approximately   $20.8 million   and net repayments of borrowings of   $44.9 million   as compared to net borrowings of   $19.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 25, 2015  . 
    
  Our Cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   includes   $187.3 million   held in jurisdictions outside the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. income taxes if repatriated into the U.S. and other restrictions. 

Critical Accounting Policies  
    
  The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. There have been no significant additions to the methods, estimates and judgments included in  Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies  in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in short-term interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are subject to exposure from changes in short-term interest rates related to interest payments on our borrowing arrangements. Under the Credit Agreement and the receivables financing facility, substantially all of our borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   are variable-rate facilities based on LIBOR or EURIBOR. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate swap or collar agreements. A hypothetical increase in the interest rate of 1.00% during the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have increased Interest expense by approximately   $3.5 million   and   $10.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  We have manufacturing sites throughout the world and sell our products globally. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we manufacture and sell products and services. During the   third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately   75%   and   72%   of our sales were derived from operations outside the U.S. We have significant manufacturing operations in European countries that are not part of the Eurozone. Sales revenues are more highly weighted toward the Euro and U.S. dollar. We also have significant contractual obligations in U.S. dollars that are met with cash flows in other currencies as well as U.S. dollars. To better match revenue and expense as well as cash needs from contractual liabilities, we regularly enter into cross currency swaps and forward contracts. 
    
  We also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The Euro denominated borrowings under the Credit Agreement provide a natural hedge to a portion of our European net asset position. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Company s Euro denominated borrowings, is reflected in the Accumulated other comprehensive loss component of Equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar as of   September 30, 2016   (net of the translation effect of our Euro denominated borrowings) would result in a reduction in Equity of approximately   $250 million  . 
    
  We also face exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the U.S. and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although we use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes, we have manufacturing sites throughout the world, and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign  
  
   33 

currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Although a significant portion of this difference is hedged, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 
    
  We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will, therefore, continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, assets and liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials used in our production processes. Commodity futures contracts are periodically used to manage such exposure. As of   September 30, 2016  , our open commodity futures contracts were not material.  
    
  See Note   11  ,  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements  in our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our derivative instruments. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in this report on Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
