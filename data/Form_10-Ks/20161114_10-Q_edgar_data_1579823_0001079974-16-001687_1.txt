NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

New Age Beverages Corporation (the "Company") was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010 under the name American Brewing Company, Inc. On April 1, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of B R Liquid Adventure, which included the brand Bucha    Live Kombucha. On June 30, 2016, the Company acquired the combined assets of New Age Beverages, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, New Age Properties, LLC and Xing Beverage, LLC (see Note 3) and changed the integrated company's name to New Age Beverages Corporation. The Company manufactures, markets and sells a portfolio of Healthy Functional Beverages including XingTea   , an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS premium Ready to Drink (RTD) Tea, Aspen Pure   , an artesian-well, naturally-high PH balanced, source water from the Colorado Rocky Mountains, XingEnergy   , an all-natural, vitamin-enriched, non-GMO, Non-HFCS Energy Drink, and B cha    Live Kombucha, an organic, all natural, fermented kombucha tea. The portfolio is distributed through the Company's own Direct Store Distribution (DSD) network in Colorado and surrounding states, throughout the United States both direct to major retailers and through its network of DSD partners, and in 10 countries around the world. The brands are sold in all channels of distribution including Hypermarkets, Supermarkets, Pharmacies, Convenience, Gas and other outlets.

Prior to acquiring the Bucha    Live Kombucha brand and business, the Company was a craft brewery operation. On October 1, 2015, American Brewing agreed to sell their brewery, brewery assets and its related liabilities to focus exclusively on the healthy functional beverage category and the B cha    brand. The assets sold consisted of accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid assets and property and equipment. The Company recognized the sale of its brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation beginning in the third quarter of 2015  (see Note 11). That transaction ultimately concluded in May 2016.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or for the full year. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted.

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on a comparative basis. For periods after the acquisition of the B cha    Live Kombucha brand (since April 1, 2015), our operating results are referred to as Successor. For periods prior to the acquisition of the B cha    Live Kombucha brand, our operating results are referred to as Predecessor. Where applicable, a black line separates the Successor and Predecessor financial information to highlight the lack of comparability between the periods.

Our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor) incorporate certain reclassifications necessary to remove our prior micro-brewing operations and brewery from our continuing operations and report them as discontinued operations. Further, our net (loss) income per share has been changed accordingly to report per-share amounts from continuing and discontinued operations. For all periods presented, we are reporting a net loss from continuing operations, and as a result our diluted (loss) earnings per share are the same as our basic (loss) income per share.

As of December 31, 2015, three customers represented approximately 93.7% (59.9%, 22.9% and 10.9%) of accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 27.5% (14.5%, 7.5% and 5.5%) of revenue. For the six months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 31.3% (18.8%, 7.9% and 4.5%) of revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor), three customers represented approximately 85.6% (30.2%, 29.4% and 26.0%) of revenue.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangement with Recourse

On April 2, 2015, the Company entered into a factoring agreement to sell, with recourse, certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial institution. Under the terms of the factoring agreement, the Company receives an advance of 80% of qualified receivables and maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time will not exceed $500,000. On July 1 st , 2016 the Company cancelled its factoring contract. As of September 30, 2016 (Successor), the Company has no factoring payable liability as compared to $110,663 as of December 31, 2015.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Goodwill and Customer Relationships

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If, on the basis of qualitative factors, it is considered not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, further testing of goodwill for impairment would not be required. Otherwise, goodwill impairment is tested using a two-step approach.

Customer relationships are recorded at acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life using the straight-line method, which is determined by identifying the period over which the cash flows from the asset are expected to be generated. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated amortization was $125,000 and $62,500, respectively.  Amortization expense was $20,834 and $62,500 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor), respectively. There was no amortization expense for customer relationships in 2015 for the periods presented. .

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets consisted of property and equipment and customer relationships and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the FASB Topic ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. The Company tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Through September 30, 2016, we had not experienced impairment losses on our long-lived assets as management determined that there were no indicators that a carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT'S LIQUIDITY PLANS

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through equity and debt financings.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,453,492 and for the nine months then ended incurred operating losses of $2,121,614.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated cash from operating activities of $989,602. 

NOTE 3   ACQUISITION OF XING BEVERAGE, LLC

On June 30, 2016, the Company acquired the assets of New Age Beverage, LLC, New Age Properties, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, and Xing Beverage, LLC (collectively, Xing). Xing is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of various teas and beverages, which will help the Company expand its capabilities and product offering.  The operating results of Xing have been consolidated with those of the Company beginning July 1, 2016.  Total purchase consideration paid was $19,995,000, which consisted of $8,500,000 of cash, a note payable for $4,500,000 and 4,353,915 shares of common stock.  The common stock issued was valued at $1.61 per share, which was the volume weighted average closing stock for the thirty days preceding the acquisition.

The purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values as follows:

The above allocation is preliminary and is subject to change.  The acquisition was consummated on June 30, 2016, and as such, the Company has begun to assess the fair value of the various net assets acquired but has not yet completed this assessment.  The Company is also in the process of identifying other intangible assets, such as customer relationships and recipes that may need to be recognized apart from goodwill.  Once identified, these other intangible assets, if any, will be recorded at their fair values.  The Company is working to finalize the allocations as quickly as possible, and anticipates that the allocation will not be final for approximately 3 to 6 months.  Any adjustments necessary may be material to the consolidated balance sheet and the amount of goodwill recognized.  Any resulting adjustments would have no impact to the September 30, 2016 reported operating results or cash flows.

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our preliminary assessment of goodwill increased by $2,188,512 resulting from increased liabilities that were assumed in the business acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition of Xing Beverage, LLC, the Company incurred transactional costs totaling $1,714,463, which has been recognized as expense as of September 30, 2016 (Successor).  Of these costs, $1,326,108 was included in legal and professional fee expense and $388,355 was included in general and administrative expenses.  Legal and professional fee expense includes the Company issuing a total of 167,994 shares of common stock to several consultants for transactional services provided.  The shares were fair valued at $1.61 per share.  The balance represents legal and professional fees incurred that have or are going to be paid in cash.  The general and administrative expense of $388,355 was pursuant to an employment agreement entered into during the first quarter of 2016, whereby an officer earned 1,078,763 shares of common stock upon the consummation of the Xing acquisition.  These shares were fair valued at $0.36 per share, which is the Company's traded stock price when entering into the employment agreement.

Overview

We are a healthy functional beverage company engaged in the development, marketing, sales and distribution of a portfolio of Ready-to-Drink (RTD) better-for-you beverages including competitive entrants currently in the kombucha, RTD tea, premium bottled water, and energy drinks segments.  We differentiate our brands through functional characteristics and ingredients and offer all natural and organic products, with no HFCS, no GMOs, no preservatives, and only all natural flavors, fruits, and other ingredients.  We manufacture of products in our own fully-integrated manufacturing facilities and through a network of six additional manufacturers strategically located throughout the United States.  Our products are currently distributed in 10 countries internationally, and in 46 states domestically through a hybrid of four routes to market including our own DSD system that reaches more than 4,500 outlets, and to more than 10,000 other outlets throughout the United States directly through customer's warehouses, through our network of DSD partners, and through our network of brokers and natural product distributors.  Our products are sold through multiple channels including major grocery retail, natural food retail, specialty outlets, hypermarkets, club stores, pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations.  We market our products using a range of marketing mediums including in-store merchandising and promotions, experiential marketing, events, and sponsorships, digital marketing and social media, direct marketing, and traditional media including print, radio, outdoor, and TV.

The Company was formerly American Brewing Company, Inc., a craft brewing company formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010.  On April 1, 2015, the Company acquired the B cha    Live Kombucha brand and the assets related to its production and sale from B R Liquid Adventure.

On October 1, 2015, we sold the assets and various liabilities related to our brewery and craft brewing operations. The assets sold consisted of accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid assets and property and equipment. The liabilities consisted of brewing-related contracts we held, liabilities related to inventory as well as lease obligations. We recognized the sale of the brewery and craft brewing operations as a discontinued operation in the year ended December 31, 2015, in accordance with accounting guidelines.  The Company changed its name to B cha, Inc in May 2016.

In June 30, 2016, the Company acquired the combined assets of New Age Beverages, LLC, New Age Properties, LLC, Aspen Pure, LLC, and Xing Beverage, LLC (collectively, New Age). New Age is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of various teas, waters, and other healthy functional beverages. This acquisition expands our capabilities and product offerings, provides a national sales footprint and organization, and substantially increases the Company's scale, supply chain and overall organization capabilities.  Immediately following the acquisition, the Company relocated its operational headquarters to Denver, Colorado,

Successor and Predecessor Financial Presentation

Throughout the financial statements and in this MD A, we refer to Successor and Predecessor. For periods after the acquisition of the B cha    Live Kombucha brand (since April 1, 2015), our operating results and cash flows are referred to as Successor.  For periods prior to the acquisition of the B cha    Live Kombucha brand, our operating results and cash flows are referred to as Predecessor. Where tables are presented in this MD A, a black line separates the Successor and Predecessor financial information to highlight the lack of comparability between the periods.

Revenue Model and Distribution Methods of our Products and Services

Our core business is to market, sell, and distribute our current brands including XingTea   , XingEnergy   , Aspen Pure    and Bucha    Live Kombucha brands, and to develop new healthy functional beverage products.  We compete in the healthy functional beverage segment, which is the growth area of RTD beverages as consumers gravitate toward better for you beverage choices and away from traditionally large beverage categories including juices and carbonated soft drinks.

XingTea   

XingTea    is an all-natural, premium RTD tea.  XingTea    competes in the roughly $50 Billion Global RTD tea market, which has experienced a compound annual growth rate over the past five years of just under 10%.

- 15 - 

XingTea    is made with green and black teas, and is further differentiated from competitors with all-natural fruit flavors, with no preservatives, no GMO's, and no HFCS.   XingTea    comes in 14 natural sweetened and unsweetened flavors in a range of packages from 23.5 ounce cans to 16 ounce multipacks and gallon jugs, and is produced in New Age's network of six manufacturers across the United States.

XingTea    is sold in 46 states and 10 countries across multiple channels of distribution from traditional grocery, health food and specialty outlets to hypermarkets, club stores, as well as gas and convenience outlets.  XingTea    contains more than 10 times the actual amount of tea than other competitors and less than one half the calories.

XingEnergy   

XingEnergy    is an all-natural, non-GMO, non-HFCS, vitamin-enriched, better-for-you Energy Drink, made with all natural fruit flavors and contains the full recommended daily allowance of B-Complex vitamins.  XingEnergy    competes in the roughly $40 Billion Global Energy Drink market, which has experienced a compound annual growth rate over the past five years of just over 6%.

XingEnergy    comes in four flavors including Tangerine Dream, Grape Attack, Mad Melon, and Grapefruit Go packaged in 16 ounce cans, sold individually, and is currently being expanded to additional packaging sizes.

Aspen Pure   

Aspen Pure    is a naturally PH-balanced, artesian-well sourced water from the Colorado Rocky Mountains.   Aspen Pure    competes in the $326 Billion bottled water category and has experienced a compound annual growth rate of over 10%.

Unlike many other premium bottled waters, Aspen Pure    has no added minerals or electrolytes.  It comes out of the ground at a natural PH-balanced level of up to 7.0, and is then purified and bottled at the source in New Age's own manufacturing facilities.

B cha    Live Kombucha

B cha    Live Kombucha is a 100% certified-organic, all-natural, probiotic, non-GMO, non-HFCS, fermented Kombucha tea with more than one billion probiotic organisms in every serving.  B cha    competes in the Kombucha category, a segment of healthy functional beverages, which has experienced compound annual growth over the past five years of 35%.

B cha    is produced with a unique and proprietary manufacturing process that eliminates the vinegary aftertaste associated with many other Kombucha's and provides the brand with an industry leading nine-months of shelf life versus a typical 90-days for competitors.  The production process also leads to consistency and stability with no risk of secondary fermentation, secondary alcohol production, incremental sugar production or over-carbonation.

B cha    is made from black teas, proprietary kombucha culture and probiotics, unique yeast strains and cultures, and all natural organic fruits and flavors.  B cha    Live Kombucha comes in seven flavors including Raspberry Pomegranate, Blood Orange, Guava Mango, Grapefruit Sage, Elderflower Green Tea, Yuzu Lemon, and Tropical Honey Blossom Ginger packaged in 16 ounce glass bottles.  The brand is sold in traditional grocery and health food and specialty outlets, and is beginning to expand distribution from California across the United States in mainstream retail and down the street outlets with the support of major DSD partners.

Our Bucha    Live Kombucha is currently distributed into approximately 2,800 stores, consisting of specialty health food stores and food, drug and mass chains including Whole Foods, Kroger, Safeway, PCC, Vons and Ralph's, Vitamin Cottage, select Airport outlets, Hotels and others.

In the past three months, distribution on the Company's entire portfolio has expanded by more than 2,000 outlets, an increase of more than 10% from the Company's previous base of around 20,000 outlets.   Over time, based on the Company's brands current level of sales per point of distribution, we expect the distribution growth to have a material impact on financial performance.

Results of Operations

The remainder of this MD A discusses our continuing operations of the newly combined entity including all of the Company's brands..  The comparisons on a three months basis for 2016 are of the newly combined entity versus the Bucha, Inc. standalone company in 2015.  The nine months comparisons include the breakout of three months of the combined new entity and six months of the B cha standalone for 2016., compared to B cha standalone for six months of 2015, and three months (the first three months of the year) of the predecessor company, B R Liquid Adventure.   Where tables are presented, a black line separates the Successor and Predecessor financial information to highlight the lack of comparability between the periods. See further discussion under " Successor and Predecessor Financial Presentation"  above.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 (newly Combined Entity) compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor)

Revenues

Gross revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $15,765,968 vs. $648,896,014 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net revenues from the sale of our product (sales less deductions, discounts and chargebacks) achieved $13,482,012 vs. $611,014 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of New Age on June 30, 2016.

Sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for the portfolio on an apples to apples or proforma basis increased 10.1%, with all brands and divisions growing led by the B cha    Live Kombucha brand that was up 40.2% vs. the three month period in the prior year.   The primary reason for the significant increase was the penetration of B cha    Live Kombucha into the New Age Distribution system, national distribution expansion of the entire portfolio, and continued expansion of the New Age DSD division in Colorado.

In the planning of the acquisition and combination between B cha, Inc. and Xing, numerous revenue synergies were identified that included sales of the B cha brand in Xing national/regional accounts, sale of the B cha    brand through New Age DSD system, and sale of the XingTea    Brand in B cha, Inc. national/regional accounts.  Capturing of these synergies have manifested in immediate value reflected in the net sales growth for the quarter, and are expected to continue with the impact of increased distribution to more than 2,000 new accounts that have been added across the portfolio during the third quarter.

Cost of Goods Sold

- 17 - 

Total cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,529,464 as compared to $458,873 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of New Age on June 30, 2016.

As a percentage of sales, total cost of goods sold was 78.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (gross margin of 21.9 %).  Production costs, excluding depreciation and amortization were $9,870,056 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $484,774 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 73.2% an improvement of 6.1 basis points vs. prior year.  Freight expense also improved significantly to 4.7% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus 13.8% in the prior year period.   

The increase in the gross margin was due to several factors, including (1) a significant increase in gross and net sales, (2) significantly increased scale and efficiencies that led to lower freight costs and transportation costs, and (3) an improvement in the production processes of some of our key products that led to lower overall manufacturing costs.

Improvement in costs of goods sold is one of the Company's major priorities, and numerous improvement opportunities across each brand have been identified and action plans emplaced to improve gross margins, have already begun to positively impact gross margin, and are expected to significantly impact gross margin in 2017.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,657,680, as compared to $467,507 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of Xing on June 30, 2016.  In addition to the impact of the operating costs of a substantially larger scale enterprise, a significant amount of the increase was also attributable to the transactional costs recognized when acquiring Xing, and numerous other one-time, non-recurring legal and other expenses associated with the integration.

On October 1, 2015, we sold our brewery and micro-brew operations, which has been classified as a discontinued operation. These discontinued operations generated net income of $50,642 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (Predecessor). During 2016, we did not have any discontinued operations.

In the planning of .the acquisition and combination between B cha, Inc and Xing, numerous cost synergies were identified that included reduction of freight expenses, improvement in cost of goods sold in both packaging and raw material sourcing, and numerous improvements in operating expenses including elimination of overlapping headcount and other duplicative expenses.    Capturing of these synergies have manifested in immediate value reflected in the cost of goods sold improvement for the quarter, and are expected to continue with the impact of elimination of headcount from B cha, Inc, further COGS savings that take time to materialize, and further operating expense improvements resulting from new processes emplaced during the quarter.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) compared to the six months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor) and the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor)

Revenues

Gross revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (3 months of combined company results plus 6 months of B cha, Inc. standalone) were  $16,285,284.  Net revenues (minus discounts and chargebacks) for the same period were $14,757,551 vs.  $1,879,861 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (includes 6 months of B cha, Inc. standalone plus 3 months of sales from the predecessor company).   The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of New Age on June 30, 2016, and overall growth of the business.

Cost of Goods Sold

Total cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,629,593 vs. $1,394,918 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (six months of B cha, Inc. standalone plus three months of the predecessor company results).   The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of New Age on June 30, 2016, and overall growth of the business.  This increase in cost of sales is consistent with the performance of the current quarter.

Our gross margins for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) was 21.5% vs. 21.9% in the current quarter, reflective of the recent improvements in cost of Goods of Goods sold and freight.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) were $3,688,533, as compared to $787,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor and Predecessor combined). The primary reason for the significant increase was the acquisition of New Age on June 30, 2016, and overall growth of the business.  In addition to the impact of the operating costs of a substantially larger scale enterprise, a significant amount of the increase was also attributable to the transactional costs recognized when acquiring New Age, and numerous other one-time, non-recurring legal and other expenses associated with the integration.

Going Concern

In its audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company's current financial position. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our ability to generate revenues. The acquisition of Xing in the end of the period significantly changed the Company's going concern assessment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $267,784 compared to cash as of December 31, 2015 of $43,856.

On a standalone basis, we believe that cash flow from operations will meet our present and near-term cash needs. The acquisition of Xing substantially improved the Company's resources.  The reduction of and refinancing of expense debt to a blended interest rate of 3.7% on a substantially lower total debt, coupled with the profitability of the new acquisition, we believe we have sufficient cash and generate sufficient profitability to meet the needs of the combined operation.  If our own combined financial resources and current cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. Any sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

Working Capital 

Current assets are primarily comprised of accounts receivable and inventories, which accounts for 95.6% and 86.7% of our current assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

- 20 - 

Current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable and accrued expenses, factoring payables and, as of September 30, 2016, a current portion ($4,500,000) of a note payable, which is due on June 30, 2017.

Increases in our reported assets and liabilities are attributable to our September 30, 2016 acquisition of Xing's net assets for $19,995,000. The purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired as follows:

The above allocation is preliminary and is subject to change. Because the acquisition was completed on June 30, 2016, the Company has begun to assess the fair value of the various net assets acquired but has not yet completed this assessment. The Company is also in the process of identifying other intangible assets, such as customer relationships and recipes that may need to be recognized apart from goodwill. Once identified, these other intangible assets, if any, will be recorded at their fair values. The Company is working to finalize the allocations as quickly as possible, and anticipates that the allocation will not be final for approximately 6 months. Any adjustments necessary may be material to the consolidated balance sheet and the amount of goodwill recognized. Any resulting adjustments would have no impact to the September 30, 2016 reported operating results or cash flows.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor) was $989,602, which is slightly less than the net cash used in the comparable periods last year.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our acquisition of Xing on September 30, 2016 (Successor), whereby we paid $8,500,000, and the acquisition of B R Liquid Adventure on April 1, 2015 (Successor), whereby we paid $400,000.

Financing Activities

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Successor), net cash provided by financing activities of $8,495,025 was due to us borrowing (i) $8,500,000 from a bank to finance the Xing acquisition and (ii) $200,000 from an unrelated party pursuant to a convertible note payable. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 (Successor), net cash provided by financing activities of $408,621was attributable to net proceeds from factoring of accounts receivable ($115,420), net increases in notes payable ($126,858) and sales of our common stock and preferred stock for cash ($86,200). For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor), the net cash used in financing activities of $70,874 was related to payments made on our notes payable.

- 21 - 

Future Financing

We may require additional funds to implement our growth strategy. Therefore, we may need to raise additional capital to sufficiently support its supply chain and support the distribution of our products in the marketplace. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis should it be required, or generate significant material revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we may be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Effects of Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements

We do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim president and chief executive officer (who is the Company's principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary (who is the Company's principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, described below.

- 22 - 

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company's financial reporting.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (" COSO ") (2013).  Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016.  The ineffectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff:

(i)

inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and

(ii)

ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes including a lack of multiple levels of 

supervision and review.

We believe that the weaknesses identified above have not had any material affect on our financial results.  However, we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the next calendar year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.

Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than the additional accounting consultants we hired in the year ended December 31, 2015 to assist with our internal controls and financial reporting, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is not currently subject to any legal proceedings.  From time to time, the Company may become subject to litigation or proceedings in connection with its business, as either a plaintiff or defendant.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in the Company's common stock involves a number of very significant risks.

The Convertible Promissory Note is convertible after 180 days into shares of the Company's common stock at a twenty-five percent (25%) discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price for the five (5) trading days prior to the date of conversion.
