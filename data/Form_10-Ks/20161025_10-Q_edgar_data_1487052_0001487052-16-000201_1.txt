NOTE 1 - BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements of LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP") and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments which are considered necessary to fairly present the results for the interim periods presented have been included.  Certain items in prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ).  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 
  In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  For further information with respect to significant accounting policies followed by the Company in preparation of its consolidated financial statements, refer to the   2015   Form 10-K.  
  The accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, whose business primarily consists of the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary, LegacyTexas Bank (the  Bank ).  All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount, in accordance with ASC 350-20.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company changed its annual goodwill impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1.  The Company believes that this new date is preferable as it provides additional time prior to the Company s year-end to complete the annual goodwill impairment test, especially in the event of future acquisitions and growth.  This change does not accelerate, delay, avoid or cause an impairment charge, nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements.  There were no impairments of goodwill recorded during the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    

NOTE 2 - SHARE TRANSACTIONS 
  On March 1, 2016, the Company announced the resumption of its existing stock repurchase program. The open-ended stock repurchase program, which commenced in August 2012, allows for the repurchase of up to   1,978,871   shares in the open market and in negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   441,750   shares have been repurchased under this stock repurchase program, leaving   1,537,121   shares available for future repurchases under the program.  Subsequently, the Company entered into a new trading plan with Sandler O Neill   Partners, LP in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to facilitate repurchases of its common stock pursuant to the above mentioned stock repurchase program.    No   shares of Company stock were repurchased under this program during the three or   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (which has been adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings to participating securities) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, reduced for average unallocated ESOP shares and average unvested restricted stock awards.  Unvested share-based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method described in ASC 260-10-45-60B.  Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock awards and options) were exercised or converted to common stock, or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the Company s earnings. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period increased for the dilutive effect of unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock awards. The dilutive effect of the unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock awards is calculated under the treasury stock method utilizing the average market value of the Company s stock for the period.  A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

The amortized cost (carrying amount) and fair value of held to maturity debt securities and the fair value of available for sale debt securities at   September 30, 2016   by contractual maturity are set forth in the table below.  Securities with contractual payments not due at a single maturity date, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, are shown separately. 

Securities with a carrying value of   $210,606   and   $280,629   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 
  Sales and call activity of securities for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows.  All securities sold were classified as available for sale. 

Gains and losses on the sale of securities classified as available for sale are recorded on the trade date using the specific-identification method.

Securities with unrealized losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, were as follows: 

1    Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 
  Other-than-Temporary Impairment 
  In determining other-than-temporary impairment for debt securities, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions; and (4) whether the Company has the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   45   securities had unrealized losses,   20   of which had been in an unrealized loss position for over 12 months at   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not believe these unrealized losses are other-than-temporary and, at   September 30, 2016  , had the intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.  All principal and interest payments are being received on time and in full.

Activity in the allowance for loan losses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , segregated by portfolio segment and evaluation for impairment, is set forth below.  All Warehouse Purchase Program loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are purchased under several contractual requirements, providing safeguards to the Company.  These safeguards include the requirement that our mortgage company customers have a takeout commitment or similar arrangement for each loan.  To date, the Company has not experienced a loss on these loans and no allowance for loan losses has been allocated to them.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the allowance for loan impairment related to purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans totaled   $164   and   $139  , respectively.

The allowance for loan losses and related provision expense are susceptible to change if the credit quality of our loan portfolio changes, which is evidenced by many factors, including but not limited to charge-offs and non-performing loan trends. Generally, consumer real estate lending has a lower credit risk profile compared to other consumer lending (such as automobile loans). Commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, however, can have higher risk profiles than consumer loans due to these loans being larger in amount and non-homogeneous in structure and term.  Changes in economic conditions, the mix and size of the loan portfolio, and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact our level of allowance for loan losses in relatively short periods of time. 
  The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover incurred losses that are estimated in accordance with US GAAP.  It is our estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date.  Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of general and specific components.  For the general component, we stratify the loan portfolio into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics and apply a loss ratio to these groups of loans to estimate the credit losses in the loan portfolio.  We use both historical loss ratios and qualitative loss factors assigned to major loan collateral types to establish general component loss allocations.  Qualitative loss factors are based on management's judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data and external economic indicators, which are not yet reflected in the historical loss ratios, and that could impact the Company's specific loan portfolios.  The Allowance for Loan Loss Committee sets and adjusts qualitative loss factors by regularly reviewing changes in underlying loan composition and the seasonality of specific portfolios.  The Allowance for Loan Loss Committee also considers credit quality and trends relating to delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans within the Company's loan portfolio when evaluating qualitative loss factors.  Additionally, the Allowance for Loan Loss Committee adjusts qualitative factors to account for the potential impact of external economic factors, including the unemployment rate, vacancy and capitalization rates and other pertinent economic data specific to our primary market area and lending portfolios. 
  For the specific component, the allowance for loan losses includes loans where management has concerns about the borrower's ability to repay and on individually analyzed loans found to be impaired. Management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower's ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, is in doubt. If an impaired loan is

  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated cost to sell, is used to determine the amount of impairment.  If an impaired loan is not collateral-dependent, the impairment amount is determined using the negative difference, if any, between the estimated discounted cash flows and the loan amount due.  For impaired loans, the amount of the impairment can be adjusted, based on current data, until such time as the actual basis is established by acquisition of the collateral or until the basis is collected.  Impairment losses are reflected in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.   Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal.  
  Large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. As a result, the Company does not separately identify consumer real estate loans less than   $417   or individual consumer non-real estate secured loans for impairment disclosures.  The Company considers these loans to be homogeneous in nature due to the smaller dollar amount and the similar underwriting criteria. 
  Changes in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, are summarized in the following table.  Please see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for more information.  

Impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows    1   : 

1     No Warehouse Purchase Program loans were impaired at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  Loans reported do not include PCI loans.

Income on impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was as follows   1   : 

1     Loans reported do not include PCI loans. 
  Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.  Loans that are past due   30   days are considered delinquent.  Interest income on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is   90   days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection.  Non-mortgage consumer loans are typically charged off no later than   120   days past due.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.  Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and larger individually classified impaired loans. 
  All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income.  Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual.  Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 
  Loans past due over 90 days that were still accruing interest totaled   $186   at   September 30, 2016   and   $111   at   December 31, 2015  , which consisted entirely of PCI loans.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   no   PCI loans were considered non-performing loans.  No Warehouse Purchase Program loans were non-performing at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  Non-performing (nonaccrual) loans were as follows: 

A loan that has been modified is considered a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) when two conditions are met:  1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and 2) concessions are made for the borrower's benefit that would not otherwise be considered for a borrower or transaction with similar credit risk characteristics.  Modifications to loan terms may include a modification of the contractual interest rate to a below-market rate (even if the modified rate is higher than the original rate), forgiveness of accrued interest, forgiveness of a portion of principal, an extended repayment period or a deed in lieu of foreclosure or other transfer of assets other than cash to fully or partially satisfy a debt.  The Company's policy is to place all

TDRs on nonaccrual for a minimum period of   six months  .  Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of   six months   and the collection of principal and interest under the revised terms is deemed probable.  All TDRs are considered to be impaired loans. 
  The outstanding balances of TDRs are shown below: 

1    Nonaccrual TDR loans are included in the nonaccrual loan totals. 
   2    Performing TDR loans are loans that have been performing under the restructured terms for at least   six months   and the Company is accruing interest on these loans. 
  The following tables provide the recorded balances of loans modified as a TDR during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

1     Principal deferrals include Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt.  Such loans are placed on non-accrual status. 
   2     Includes a   $6.3 million   reserve-based energy relationship; the primary modification to this relationship was suspension of required borrowing base payments. 
   Loans modified as a TDR during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   which experienced a subsequent payment default during the periods are shown below.   A payment default is defined as a loan that was   90 days   or more past due.

Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition, for which it was probable that the Company would not be able to collect all contractual amounts due, were accounted for as PCI loans.  The carrying amount of PCI loans included in the consolidated balance sheets and the related outstanding balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are set forth in the table below.  The outstanding balance represents the total amount owed, including accrued but unpaid interest, and any amounts previously charged off. 

1    The carrying amounts are reported net of allowance for loan losses of   $164   and   $150   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015   are as follows: 

Below is an analysis of the age of recorded investment in loans that were past due at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  No Warehouse Purchase Program loans were delinquent at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   and therefore are not included in the following table. 

1    Includes acquired PCI loans with a total carrying value of   $6,714   and   $11,328   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  For loans collateralized by real property and commercial and industrial loans, credit exposure is monitored by internally assigned grades used for classification of loans.  A loan is considered  special mention  when management has determined that there is a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. Loans rated as "special mention" are not adversely classified according to regulatory classifications and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  A loan is considered  substandard  if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any.   Substandard  loans include those characterized by the  distinct possibility  that the

insured institution will sustain  some loss  if the deficiencies are not corrected, and the loan may or may not meet the criteria for impairment.  Loans classified as  doubtful  have all of the weaknesses of those classified as  substandard , with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make  collection or liquidation in full,  on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values,  highly questionable and improbable.   All other loans that do not fall into the above mentioned categories are considered  pass  loans.  Updates to internally assigned grades are made monthly and/or upon significant developments. 
  For other consumer loans (non-real estate), credit exposure is monitored by payment history of the loans.  Non-performing other consumer loans are on nonaccrual status and are generally greater than   90   days past due. 
  The recorded investment in loans by credit quality indicators at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows.

NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE       
  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant and unobservable in the market. These instruments are valued using the best information available, some of which is internally developed, and reflects a reporting entity s own assumptions about the risk premiums that market participants would generally require and the assumptions they would use. 
  The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 
  The Company elects the fair value option for residential mortgage loans held for sale in accordance with ASC 825, "Financial Instruments".   This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to  economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging.   Mortgage loans held for sale, which are sold on a servicing released basis, are valued on a recurring basis using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk, (ii) current commitments to purchase loans or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted to credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. As these prices are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classifies these valuations as Level 2 in the fair value disclosures.  Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on the contractual rates and reflected in interest income on loans held for sale in the consolidated income statement.   
    
  Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (i) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (ii) the transferee has the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (iii) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement that entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.  The Company has no continuing involvement in any residential mortgage loans sold. 
  The Company enters into a variety of derivative instruments as part of its hedging strategy and measures these instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet. The majority of these derivatives are forward mortgage-backed securities and are exchange-traded or traded within highly active dealer markets. In order to determine the fair value of these instruments, the Company utilized the exchange price or dealer market price for the particular derivative contract; therefore these contracts are classified as Level 2. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments ("IRLCs") with prospective borrowers. These commitments are carried at fair value based on the fair value of the underlying mortgage loans which are based on observable market data. The Company adjusts the outstanding IRLCs with prospective borrowers based on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. IRLCs are recorded in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These commitments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value disclosures, as the valuations are based on market observable inputs.   Net gains of   $102   and   $398   resulting from changes in the fair value of these IRLCs and net losses of   $171   and   $817   on forward mortgage-backed securities trades were recorded in net gain on sale of mortgage loans during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  These gains and losses were not attributable to instrument-specific credit risk.  Please see Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more information. 
  The Company also enters into certain interest rate derivative positions that are not designated as hedging instruments. The estimated fair value of these commercial loan interest rate swaps are obtained from a pricing service that provides the swaps' unwind value (Level 2 inputs).   The fair value of these derivative positions outstanding are included in other assets and

other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Please see Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.  
  Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis 
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. 

1     At   September 30, 2016  , loans held for sale had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $22,395  .  There were no mortgage loans held for sale that were 90 days or greater past due or on non-accrual at   September 30, 2016  .   
  Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 
    
  Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below.  There were   no   liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 

Impaired loans that are collateral dependent are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral adjusted by additional Level 3 inputs, such as discounts of market value, estimated marketing costs and estimated legal expenses.  Impaired loans secured by real estate, receivables or inventory had discounts determined by management on an individual loan basis.  Impaired loans that are not collateral dependent are measured for impairment by a discounted cash flow analysis using a net present value calculation that utilizes data from the loan file before and after the modification. 
  Foreclosed assets are measured at the lower of book or fair value less costs to sell using third party appraisals, listing

agreements or sale contracts, which may be adjusted by additional Level 3 inputs, such as discounts of market value, estimated marketing costs and estimated legal expenses. Management may also consider additional adjustments on specific properties due to the age of the appraisal, expected holding period, lack of comparable sales, or if the other real estate owned is a special use property.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $73   in residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure. 
  The Credit Risk Management department evaluates the valuations on impaired loans and foreclosed assets at least quarterly.  The valuations on impaired loans are reviewed at least quarterly by the Allowance for Loan Loss Committee and are considered in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses.  Unobservable inputs, such as discounts to collateral, are monitored and adjusted if market conditions change. 
  The carrying amount and fair value information of financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and at   December 31, 2015  , were as follows:

  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument presented: 
  Cash and cash equivalents -   Due to their short term nature, the carrying amount approximates the estimated fair value. 
  Securities held to maturity -   The fair values of these securities is determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 
  Loans held for investment (including Warehouse Purchase Program loans) -   Fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market offering rates, estimated life, and applicable credit risk. 
  FHLB stock and other restricted securities -   The fair value on these securities is their cost basis due to restrictions on transferability. 
  Accrued interest receivable -   Due to their short term nature, the carrying amount approximates the estimated fair value. 
  Deposits -   Fair value is calculated using the FHLB advance curve to discount cash flows based on the estimated life of the deposits. 
  FHLB advances -   Fair value is calculated using the FHLB advance curve to discount cash flows based on the contractual repayment schedule. 
  Repurchase agreement -   The fair value is based on discounting the estimated cash flows using the current rate at which similar borrowings would be made with similar terms and remaining maturities. 
  Subordinated debt -   The estimated fair value is based on current market rates on similar debt in the market. 
  Accrued interest payable -   Due to their short term nature, the carrying amount approximates the estimated fair value. 
  The fair value of off-balance sheet items is based on the current fees or costs that would be charged to enter into or terminate such arrangements and are not considered significant to this presentation. 

NOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The Company enters into IRLCs with prospective residential mortgage borrowers whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the borrowers have locked into that interest rate.  These commitments are carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The estimated fair values of IRLCs are based on observable market data and are recorded in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company adjusts the outstanding IRLCs with prospective borrowers based on the expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded.  The initial and subsequent changes in the fair value of IRLCs are a component of net gain on sale of mortgage loans. 
  The Company actively manages the risk profiles of its IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale on a daily basis.  To manage the price risk associated with IRLCs, the Company enters into forward sales of mortgage-backed securities in an amount similar to the portion of the IRLC expected to close, assuming no change in mortgage interest rates.  In addition, to manage the interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans held for sale, the Company enters into forward sales of mortgage-backed securities to deliver mortgage loan inventory to investors.  The estimated fair values of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and forward sale commitments are based on quoted market values and are recorded in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  The initial and subsequent changes in value on forward sales of mortgage-backed securities are a component of net gain on sale of mortgage loans. 
  The following table provides the outstanding notional balances and fair values of outstanding positions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The Company enters into certain interest rate derivative positions that are not designated as hedging instruments.  These derivative positions related to transactions in which we entered into an interest rate swap or cap with a customer, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap or cap with another financial institution.  In connection with each swap transaction, we agree to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate.  At the same time, we agree to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount.  The transaction allows our customer to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate.  In connection with each interest rate cap, we sell a cap to the customer and agree to pay interest if the underlying index exceeds the strike price defined in the cap agreement.  Simultaneously we purchase a cap with matching terms from another financial institution which agrees to pay us if the underlying index exceeds the strike price.  Because we act as an intermediary for our customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts substantially offset each other and do not have a material impact on our results of operations.  The Company presents derivative instruments at fair value in other assets and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The notional amounts and estimated fair values of interest rate swap derivative positions outstanding and weighted-average receive and pay interest rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table. 

Our credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net favorable value of all swaps by each counterparty.  In some cases, collateral may be required from the counterparties involved if the net value of the swaps exceeds a nominal amount considered to be immaterial.  Collateral levels are monitored and adjusted on a regular basis for changes in interest rate swap values.  Our cash collateral pledged for interest rate swaps and included in our interest-bearing deposits, which totaled   $1,950   at   September 30, 2016   and   $300   at   December 31, 2015  , is in excess of our credit exposure.  The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the amounts collected and/or deposited on derivative instruments in its consolidated balance sheets.

  Compensation cost charged to income for share-based compensation is presented below: 

A summary of activity in the restricted stock portion of the Company's stock plans is presented below: 

1   For restricted stock awards with time-based vesting conditions, the grant date fair value is based upon the closing stock price as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the grant date.  
   2    For restricted stock awards with performance-based vesting conditions, the value of the award is based upon the closing stock price as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of vesting.  Until the final value is determined on the vesting date, the Company estimates the fair value quarterly based upon the closing stock price as quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market near the last business day of each calendar quarter end. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $5,488   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted shares awarded under the Company's stock plans.  That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.66 years  .

NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions which, in accordance with US GAAP, are not included in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit losses up to the face amount of these instruments could occur, although material losses are not anticipated.  The Company's credit policies applied to loan originations are also applied to these commitment requests, including obtaining collateral at the exercise of the commitment. 
  The contractual amounts of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are summarized below.  Please see Part I-Item 2-"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments" of this Form 10-Q for information related to commitment maturities. 

Unused commitments to extend credit -   The Company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes.  Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company. Substantially all of the Company's commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of future loan funding. 
     Unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans -   In regard to unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans, the Company has established maximum purchase facility amounts, but reserves the right, at any time, to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by each customer, for any reason in the Company's sole and absolute discretion. 
  Standby letters of credit -   Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
  In addition to the commitments above, the Company guarantees the credit card debt of certain customers to the merchant bank that issues the credit cards. These guarantees are in place for as long as the guaranteed credit card is open. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these credit card guarantees totaled   $2,900   and   $1,028  , respectively. This amount represents the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee, which the Company is responsible for in the event of customer non-payment. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company established an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments through a charge to provision for credit losses on the Company's consolidated statement of income.  The establishment of this allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments was due to the expansion of the Company's lending business, as well as recent increased diversification of the types of off-balance sheet commitments offered by the Company.   At   September 30, 2016  , this allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, included in "other liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $1,167  .

In addition to the commitments above, the Company had overdraft protection available in the amounts of   $85,955   and   $87,077   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company, at   September 30, 2016  , had FHLB letters of credit of   $955,303   pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2,380   of unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet related to investments in community development-oriented private equity funds used for Community Reinvestment Act purposes. 

NOTE 11 - RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS     
  Effect of Newly Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  This ASU states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU affects entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public entities to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "  Leases  ."  This ASU requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting treatment.  This ASU changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease execution costs, and, for lessors, modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  For public business entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.  Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures. 
   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."    This ASU removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses when it is probable that the loss has been incurred.   This revised guidance will remove all recognition thresholds and will require companies to recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Credit losses will be immediately recognized through net income; the amount recognized will be based on the current estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected over the financial asset s contractual term.  ASU 2016-13 also amends the credit loss measurement guidance for available-for-sale debt securities.  For public business entities, this ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures.

  The factors listed above could materially affect the Company s financial performance and could cause the Company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.  
    
  The Company does not undertake - and specifically declines any obligation - to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speaks only as of the date made. You should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC for specific risks that could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.

Our primary sources of funds are deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings, and payments received on loans and securities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts that provide a wide range of interest rates and terms, generally including savings, money market, term certificate and demand accounts.  
  Our principal objective is to be an independent, commercially-oriented, customer-focused financial services company, providing outstanding service and innovative products in our primary market area of North Texas. Our Board of Directors has adopted a strategy designed to maintain growth and profitability, a strong capital position and high asset quality.  
  Performance Highlights 

Net income of   $27.2 million   for the   third quarter   of 2016 was a record high for the Company, up   $9.3 million  , or 52.1%, from the third quarter of 2015, which includes a   $12.3 million   increase in net interest income and a   $4.0 million   decrease in the provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by a   $574,000   decrease in non-interest income and a   $1.8 million   increase in non-interest expense. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Certain of our accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that determining the allowance for loan losses is its most critical accounting estimate. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Allowance for Loan Loss.   The allowance for loan losses and related provision expense are susceptible to change if the credit quality of our loan portfolio changes, which is evidenced by many factors, including but not limited to charge-offs and non-performing loan trends. Generally, consumer real estate lending has a lower risk profile compared to other consumer lending (such as automobile loans). Commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, however, can have higher risk profiles than consumer loans due to these loans being larger in amount and more susceptible to fluctuations in industry, market and economic conditions.  Additionally, the Company has recently increased qualitative reserve factors on energy loans due to the impact of continued pressure on the price of oil and gas, which has led to a sustained increase in economic and regulatory uncertainty surrounding energy loans.  While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans,  
  
   31 

changes in economic conditions, the mix and size of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact our level of allowance for loan losses in relatively short periods of time.  Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents coverage of our best estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower's ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, is in doubt. If an impaired loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated cost to sell, is used to determine the amount of impairment.  If an impaired loan is not collateral-dependent, the impairment amount is determined using the negative difference, if any, between the estimated discounted cash flows and the loan amount due.  For impaired loans, the amount of the impairment can be adjusted, based on current data, until such time as the actual basis is established by acquisition of the collateral or until the basis is collected.  Impairment losses are reflected in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses. Subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.   Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal. 
   
  Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015    
  General  . Total assets increased by   $748.1 million  , or   9.7%  , to   $8.44 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $7.69 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to a   $690.7 million  , or   13.6%  , increase in gross loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, and a   $302.1 million  , or   28.9%  , increase in Warehouse Purchase Program loans.  The increase in total assets due to loan portfolio growth was partially offset by a   $337.8 million  , or   54.9%  , decrease in cash and cash equivalents.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to two large deposits totaling $196.4 million that were made on the last day of 2015, with $137.0 million of these deposits withdrawn during the 2016 period.  
  Loans.   Gross loans held for investment increased by   $992.8 million  , or   16.2%  , to   $7.10 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $6.11 billion   at December 31,   2015  , while one- to four-family mortgage loans held for sale increased by   $649,000  , or   2.9%  , for the same period.  

Gross loans held for investment at   September 30, 2016  , excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, grew   $690.7 million  , or   13.6%  , from December 31, 2015, which included growth in all loan categories with the exception of a   $12.7 million   decline in other consumer loans.  Commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans at September 30, 2016 increased by   $355.9 million   and   $199.9 million  , respectively, from December 31, 2015, and construction and land and consumer real estate loans increased by   $38.0 million   and   $109.6 million  , respectively, for the same period.  Consumer real estate loans were reduced in the 2016 period by the third quarter 2016 sale of the Company's $34.4 million Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") loan portfolio, which was sold to reduce future loan servicing and compliance costs.   
  Reserve-based energy loans, which are reported as commercial and industrial loans, totaled   $433.5 million   (which includes 44 relationships managed by the Energy Finance group) at   September 30, 2016  , down $26.3 million from $459.8 million at December 31, 2015.  Substantially all of the reserve-based energy loans are secured by deeds of trust on properties  
  
   32 

containing proven oil and natural gas reserves.  Due to the sensitivity of the energy portfolio to downward movements in oil prices, the Company has seen migration in the portfolio into criticized classifications during the past year.  See "Allowance for Credit Losses" for more information. 
     
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's reserve-based energy portfolio (reported above at   $433.5 million  ) consisted of 48% natural gas reserves and 52% crude oil reserves.  The Company encourages, and in some cases even requires, borrowers to utilize commodity hedges, in order to stabilize cash flows during volatile commodity price environments.  Hedges are used to guard against falling prices, and the goal is that the duration of the hedge will last long enough for prices to come back from any significant decline.  Hedges will typically include minimum and maximum allowed percentage of production, a minimum and maximum allowed term, and a minimum price. 
    
  In addition to the reserve-based energy loans, the Company has loans categorized as "Midstream and Other," which are typically related to the transmission of oil and natural gas and would only be indirectly impacted from declining commodity prices.  At   September 30, 2016  , "Midstream and Other" loans had a total outstanding balance of   $53.9 million  , consisting of four relationships.  Also, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had five relationships in the commercial   industrial loan portfolio (outside of the reserve-based and midstream loans discussed above) that are involved in the energy exploration sector providing front-end service to companies who drill oil and gas wells and whose business could be impacted by the dramatic reduction in drilling activity as a result of the severe drop in the price of oil and gas.  These relationships totaled $2.8 million at September 30, 2016.  
  Warehouse Purchase Program loans increased by   $302.1 million  , or   28.9%  , to   $1.35 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $1.04 billion   at December 31, 2015.  Although not bound by any legally binding commitment, when a purchase decision is made, the Company purchases a 100% participation interest in the loans originated by our mortgage banking company customers.  The mortgage banking company closes mortgage loans consistent with underwriting standards established by approved investors and, once all pertinent documents are received, the participation interest is delivered by the Company to the investor selected by the originator and approved by the Company.  Loans funded by the Warehouse Purchase Program during the   third quarter   of 2016 consisted of 54% conforming, 39% government loans and 7% of other loan types, including Jumbo loans. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses  . The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses that are estimated in accordance with US GAAP. It is our estimate of credit losses in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of general and specific components.  For more information about the Company's calculation of its allowance for loan losses, please see Item 1 (Financial Statements) - Note 5 - "Loans" under Part 1 of this report. 
  Acquired loans initially are recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition.  An allowance will be recorded in later periods if additional losses are subsequently anticipated. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is limited to the amount that the calculated allowance for loan losses exceeds the remaining purchase discount. 
  PCI loans are not considered nonperforming loans, and accordingly, are not included in the non-performing loans to total loans ratio as a numerator, but are included in total loans reflected in the denominator. The result is a downward trend in the ratio when compared to prior periods, assuming all other factors stay the same. Similarly, other asset quality ratios, such as the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio will reflect a downward trend, assuming all other factors stay the same, due to the impact of PCI loans on the denominator with no corresponding impact in the numerator. 
  Our non-performing loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and larger individually evaluated impaired loans. Loans generally are placed on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes 90 days or more delinquent.  Non-performing loans include loans that are not contractually past due but have been placed on nonaccrual status due to the loan's designation as a troubled debt restructuring or if there is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies existing within a loan are not corrected.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status (or charged-off) at an earlier date when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful or other factors involving the loan warrant placing the loan on nonaccrual status.

Non-performing loans to total loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans, was   0.71%   at   September 30, 2016  , down four basis points from   0.75%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Including Warehouse Purchase Program loans, non-performing loans to total loans held for investment was   0.58%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.63%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Non-performing loans increased by   $2.6 million   to   $40.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $38.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was primarily due to reserve-based energy loans that were downgraded to substandard non-performing status in 2016.   At   September 30, 2016  , substandard non-performing energy loans totaled   $22.0 million  , with downgrades resulting from collateral value declines and deteriorating financial conditions due to the ongoing low commodity price environment.  The Company had set aside specific reserves totaling $217,000 at   September 30, 2016   on these non-performing energy loans based on recent collateral valuations.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , non-performing energy loans were reduced by a $12.0 million reserve-based energy loan that was resolved through bankruptcy proceedings, resulting in a $6.9 million charge-off.  This decrease was partially offset by a $7.5 million reserve-based energy relationship that was downgraded to substandard non-performing during the third quarter of 2016 due to declining collateral values and resulting diminished operating performance following a review as part of the Shared National Credit ("SNC") program, which is a regulatory review conducted by the FRB, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of large syndicated loans of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more supervised institutions.  The Company does not have any specific reserve set aside for this relationship and does not currently anticipate a loss.   
  Over the past year, risk rating downgrades on energy loans have increased, primarily in the special mention category, which consists entirely of performing loans.  The below table shows criticized energy loans at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

The increase in substandard performing energy loans on a year-over-year basis, as well as the increase in special mention performing energy loans on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, resulted from collateral value declines and deteriorating financial condition due to the ongoing pressure on the price of oil and gas.  At September 30, 2016, no special mention or substandard performing energy loans were considered to be impaired, and the Company did not have any specific loss reserves set aside for these loans.  The Company continues to take action to improve the risk profile of the criticized energy loans by instituting monthly commitment reductions, obtaining additional collateral, obtaining additional guarantor support and/or requiring additional equity injections or asset sales.   
  Our allowance for loan losses was   $57.3 million  , or   0.81%   of total loans held for investment (including Warehouse Purchase Program loans), at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $47.1 million  , or   0.77%   of total loans held for investment (including Warehouse Purchase Program loans), at   December 31, 2015  .  Our allowance for loan losses to total loans held for investment, excluding Warehouse Purchase Program loans and acquired loans, was   1.12%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.14%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Our allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was   140.26%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   123.23%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2015, was primarily related to increased qualitative reserve factors applied to the Energy portfolio due to the impact of continued pressure on the price of oil and gas, which has resulted in sustained increases in economic uncertainty and regulatory concerns surrounding energy loans.   The allowance for loan losses allocated to energy loans at   September 30, 2016   totaled $16.1 million, up $4.1 million from $12.0 million at December 31, 2015 and up $11.2 million from $4.9 million at September 30, 2015.  In addition to the $217,000 in specific reserves on non-performing energy relationships, these reserve amounts continue to reflect elevated qualitative factors compared to the 2015 periods. Since the inception of our Energy Finance Group, we have maintained a number of risk mitigation techniques, including sound underwriting (reasonable advance rates based on number and diversification of wells), sound policy (requiring hedges on production) and conservative collateral valuations (frequent borrowing base determinations at prices below NYMEX posted rates).  All borrowing base valuations are performed by experienced and nationally recognized third party firms intimately familiar with the properties and their production history.  The Company believes that the level of loan loss reserves for energy loans as of September 30, 2016 is sufficient to cover estimated  
  
   34 

credit losses in the portfolio based on currently available information; however, future sustained low levels of oil pricing could lead to further risk rating downgrades, additional loan loss reserves, or losses.   
  Non-performing commercial real estate loans declined by $6.1 million compared to December 31, 2015 due to a non-performing commercial real estate property secured by a medical facility that was transferred into foreclosed assets in the 2016 period.  For more information about the Company's non-performing loans, please see Note 5 of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this report.  Net charge-offs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $7.2 million  , an increase of $7.1 million from the second quarter of 2016 and an increase of $5.2 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to the $6.9 million charge-off recorded on the $12.0 million non-performing energy loan discussed above.   
    
  Due to the expansion of our lending business, as well as recent increased diversification of the types of off-balance sheet commitments offered by the Company, management established an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments during the third quarter of 2016. $1.2 million of the provision for credit loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 funded this allowance.  This allowance for off-balance sheet credit loss is included in "other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In our 2015 Form 10-K, we disclosed a borrowing relationship comprised of multiple affiliated funds (collectively referred to as the "Borrower") which had $20.8 million outstanding in commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Borrower had $6.7 million outstanding.  In Form 8-K filings with the SEC dated February 22, 2016 and November 24, 2015, the Borrower disclosed that it is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the SEC and that its auditor declined to stand for reappointment, although no disagreements were cited between the Borrower and its auditors. In a Form 8-K filing with the SEC dated June 8, 2016, the Borrower disclosed that it had engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm.  In a Form 8-K filing with the SEC dated October 18, 2016, the Borrower disclosed that it had received a "Wells Notice" from the staff (the "Staff") of the SEC's Division of Enforcement stating that the Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Borrower.  The Borrower intends to provide to the Staff a Wells submission to further explain the Borrower's views and its belief that no enforcement action is warranted against the Borrower.  At September 30, 2016, the Company classified $4.0 million of the relationship as  Substandard", with the remaining $2.7 million of the relationship classified as "Special Mention." The entire $6.7 million relationship was considered performing at September 30, 2016. Based on the Company's most recent analysis, the value of the collateral securing each of the loans is believed to be in excess of the loan amounts. The Company will continue to monitor this borrowing relationship. 
  Classified Assets.    Loans and other assets, such as securities and foreclosed assets, that are considered by management to be of lesser quality are classified as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss."  An asset is considered "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the weaknesses of those classified as "substandard," with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  Assets classified as "loss" are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. PCI loans are included in the "substandard" and "doubtful" categories. 
  We regularly review the assets in our portfolio to determine whether any should be considered as classified.  The total amount of classified assets represented   18.7%   of our total equity and   1.9%   of our total assets at   September 30, 2016   compared to   13.5%   of our total equity and   1.4%   of our total assets at   December 31, 2015  .  The aggregate amount of classified assets at the dates indicated was as follows:   

35 

Substandard loans at   September 30, 2016   increased by   $48.0 million   from   December 31, 2015  , which was primarily due to downgraded energy loans discussed above in "Allowance for Credit Losses"     and was partially offset by a $10.5 million non-performing commercial real estate property secured by a medical facility that was transferred into foreclosed assets in the 2016 period.  
  The Company also has potential problem loans, considered "other loans of concern," that are currently performing and do not meet the criteria for impairment, but where there is the distinct possibility that we might sustain some loss if credit deficiencies are not corrected.  These possible credit problems may result in the future inclusion of these loans in the non-performing asset categories and consisted of   $100.6 million   in loans that were classified as "substandard," but were still accruing interest and were not considered impaired at   September 30, 2016   (excluding PCI loans.) Other loans of concern at   September 30, 2016   increased by $49.0 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to energy loans that were downgraded to substandard performing status during the 2016 period  (See "Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information about downgraded energy loans.) Other loans of concern have been considered in management's analysis of potential loan losses. 
  Securities  . Our securities portfolio increased   $102.4 million  , or   18.5%  , to   $654.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $552.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, purchases totaling   $2.29 billion   offset paydowns and maturities of securities totaling   $2.18 billion   and security sales totaling   $8.1 million  .  
  Deposits.   Total deposits increased   $901.4 million  , or   17.2%  , to   $6.13 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $5.23 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , which includes growth in all deposit categories. 

Time deposits increased by   $433.8 million   compared to December 31, 2015, while savings and money market, non-interest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits increased by   $232.7 million  ,   $205.6 million   and   $29.2 million  , respectively, for the same period.  Time deposits at September 30, 2016 included $101.6 million in brokered deposits that were added in the 2016 period.       
  Borrowings  . FHLB advances decreased   $305.6 million  , or   21.2%  , to $  1.13 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $1.44 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The outstanding balance of FHLB advances decreased primarily due to strong deposit growth of   $901.4 million   during the 2016 period, which reduced the need to borrow from the FHLB.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was eligible to borrow an additional   $1.73 billion   from the FHLB.  
  
   36 

The table below shows FHLB advances by maturity and weighted average rate at   September 30, 2016  : 

Additionally, the Company has   eight   available federal funds lines of credit with other financial institutions totaling   $255.0 million   and was eligible to borrow   $51.6 million   from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had a   $25.0 million   outstanding structured repurchase agreement with Credit Suisse, as well as   $50.1 million   in overnight repurchase agreements with depositors.  Also, at   September 30, 2016  , subordinated debt totaled   $134.1 million  , which included $122.4 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (reported net of $2.6 million in debt issuance costs.)  $75.0 million of these notes were issued by the Company in November 2015, and $50.0 million additional notes were issued in September 2016 when the Company reopened the offering.  The   $134.1 million   of subordinated debt also included $11.7 million of trust preferred securities that were acquired through the merger with LegacyTexas Group, Inc.  All subordinated debt is reported net of purchase accounting fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the $50.0 million reopening of the subordinated debt offering to pay off its $24.9 million (reported net of debt issuance costs) unsecured term loan borrowed in the second quarter of 2016 and previously reported in other borrowings.  
  Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities.    Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased   $48.6 million  , or   91.6%  , to   $101.6 million    at   September 30, 2016   from   $53.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $34.7 million increase in commercial escrow funds collected from commercial borrowers, which is related to an increase in commercial loan volume compared to the 2015 period, as well as timing of escrow payments.   
  Shareholders  Equity  . Total shareholders' equity increased by   $62.8 million  , or   7.8%  , to   $866.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $804.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  1   N/M - not meaningful 
  The increase in shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016  , compared to December 31, 2015, was primarily due to net income of   $72.5 million   recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which was partially offset by the payment of quarterly dividends totaling   $0.43   per common share, or   $20.5 million  , during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  
   37 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  General.   Net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $27.2 million  , an increase of   $9.3 million  , or   52.1%  , from net income of   $17.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in net income was driven by a   $15.9 million   increase in interest income on loans and a   $4.0 million   decrease in the provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by a   $574,000   decrease in non-interest income, a   $1.8 million   increase in non-interest expense and a   $2.4 million   increase in interest expense on deposits.  Basic earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.59  , a   $0.20   increase from   $0.39   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.58  , a $0.20 increase from   $0.38   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest Income.     Interest income increased by   $16.4 million  , or   24.6%  , to   $82.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $66.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The   $16.4 million   increase in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily due to a   $15.9 million  , or   25.3%  , increase in interest income on loans, which was driven by increased volume in all loan categories with the exception of other consumer loans.  The average balance of commercial real estate loans increased by $579.2 million from the 2015 period, which was partially offset by a nine basis point year-over-year decrease in the average yield earned on this portfolio, resulting in a $7.1 million increase in interest income.  The average balance of commercial and industrial loans increased by $370.2 million from the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a $4.2 million increase in interest income.  The average balance of Warehouse Purchase Program and consumer real estate loans increased by $286.2 million and $200.8 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2015, leading to increases in interest income of $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  Interest income on loans for the third quarter of 2016 included $1.2 million in accretion of purchase accounting fair value adjustments on acquired loans, compared to $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2015.  
  Interest Expense.    Interest expense increased by   $4.1 million  , or   76.7%  , to   $9.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $5.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The increase in interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits, which was driven by increased volume and rates in all deposit products. A $478.9 million increase in the average balance of savings and money market deposits and a $470.2 million increase in the average balance of time deposits, along with a 14 basis point increase in the average rate paid on savings and money market deposits and a nine basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits, increased interest expense by $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Interest expense on borrowings increased by $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to the issuance  
  
   38 

of $75.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes by the Company in November 2015, as well as a 31 basis point increase in the average rate paid over the period.   
  Net Interest Income.    Net interest income increased by   $12.3 million  , or   20.1%  , to   $73.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $61.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The net interest margin decreased by   20   basis points to   3.80%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   4.00%   for the same period last year. The net interest rate spread decreased by   23   basis points to   3.65%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.88%   for the same period last year.  Accretion of interest resulting from the merger with LegacyTexas Group, Inc. on January 1, 2015, as well as the 2012 Highlands acquisition, contributed six basis points to the net interest margin and average yield on earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 12 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The average yield on earning assets for the third quarter of 2016 was   4.28%  , a   seven   basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2015.  The average cost of deposits for the third quarter of 2016 was   0.39%  , up ten basis points from the third quarter of 2015, with the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities up 16 basis points to   0.63%   for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a 31 basis point increase in borrowing costs. 
  Provision for Credit Losses.    The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of   $3.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , down   $4.0 million   from   $7.5 million   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in the provision for credit losses compared to the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a lower amount of commercial loans originated during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the 2015 period, particularly in the energy portfolio, which require a higher allocation of allowance for loan losses when added to the Company's balance sheet.  For more information about the Company's allowance for loan losses, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 - Allowance for Loan Losses" contained in Item 2 of this report.  Provision for credit losses included a $1.2 million expense recorded to establish a reserve for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments, which resulted from the expansion of our lending business, as well as recent increased diversification of the types of off-balance sheet commitments offered by the Company. 
  Non-interest Income.    Non-interest income decreased by   $574,000  , or   4.8%  , to   $11.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $11.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  

1   N/M - not meaningful 
  The   $574,000   decrease in non-interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily due to a loss of $1.5 million on the sale of the Company's $34.4 million FHA loan portfolio recorded to other non-interest income in the third quarter of 2016.  Other non-interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was also lower than the 2015 period due to $695,000 in income recorded in the third quarter of 2015 from insurance activities, which was not repeated in the third quarter of 2016 due to the second quarter 2016 sale of the Company s insurance subsidiary operations.  Other non-interest income for the third quarter of 2016 included a $105,000 net increase in the value of investments in community development-oriented private equity funds used for Community Reinvestment Act purposes (the "CRA Funds"), compared to a $202,000 net increase in the CRA Funds recorded in the third quarter of 2015.  Service charges and other fees increased by   $1.5 million   compared to the third quarter of 2015, which included a $746,000 increase in commercial loan fee income (consisting of syndication, arrangement, non-usage and pre-payment fees), a $311,000 increase in Warehouse Purchase Program fee income, and a $170,000 increase in title insurance premiums.  The Company recognized   $2.4 million   in net gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale during the third quarter of 2016, which includes the gain recognized on $60.2 million of one-to four-family mortgage loans that were sold or committed for sale during the third quarter of 2016, fair value changes on mortgage derivatives and mortgage fees collected,  
  
   39 

compared to   $1.9 million   in comparable net gains recorded during the third quarter of 2015 on $59.5 million of one-to four-family mortgage loans sold.  
  Non-interest Expense.    Non-interest expense increased by   $1.8 million  , or   4.9%  , to   $39.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $37.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The increase in non-interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily due to a   $1.2 million   increase in data processing expense compared to the third quarter of 2015, which included increased expenses for debit card issuance and processing services, as the Company has converted all debit cards to the Europay, MasterCard and Visa ("EMV") chip technology to assist with reduction of future fraud.  Other non-interest expense increased   $459,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to an increase in debit card fraud losses in the 2016 period.  Salaries and employee benefits expense for the third quarter of 2016 increased by   $285,000   compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in the 2016 period, which increased salary expense by $1.4 million, and increased loan production in the 2016 period, which led to a $976,000 increase in performance-based incentive accruals and commissions. These increases in salaries and employee benefits expense in the 2016 period were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in deferred salary costs related to loan originations that will be accounted for over the lives of the related loans, a reduction of $467,000 in salaries and benefits attributable to the Company's insurance subsidiary operations, which was sold in the second quarter of 2016, and a $282,000 reduction in severance payments and sign-on bonuses compared to the third quarter of 2015.  
  Income Tax Expense.    For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   we recognized income tax expense of   $14.4 million   on our pre-tax income, which was an effective tax rate of   34.6%  , compared to income tax expense of   $9.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which was an effective tax rate of   35.4%  . The decrease in the effective tax rate in the 2016 period primarily resulted from a book basis and tax basis difference related to the Company's ESOP. 
   
  Comparison of Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  General.   Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $72.5 million  , an increase of   $18.0 million  , or   33.1%  , from net income of   $54.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in net income was driven by increased net interest and non-interest income, and was partially offset by increased provision for loan losses and non-interest expense.  Basic earnings per share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.56  , an increase of   $0.38   from   $1.18   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Diluted earnings per share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.56  , an increase of   $0.39   from   $1.17   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  
   40 

Interest Income.     Interest income increased by   $39.7 million  , or   20.6%  , to   $232.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $193.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The   $39.7 million   increase in interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to a   $38.5 million  , or   21.1%  , increase in interest income on loans, which was driven by increased volume in all loan categories with the exception of other consumer loans.  The average balance of commercial real estate loans increased by $513.0 million, which was partially offset by a 16 basis point year-over-year decrease in the average yield earned on this portfolio, resulting in a $17.4 million increase in interest income.  The average balance of commercial and industrial loans increased by $430.7 million, which was partially offset by a 26 basis point year-over-year decrease in the average yield earned on this portfolio, resulting in an $11.9 million increase in interest income.    The average balance of consumer real estate and Warehouse Purchase Program loans increased by $186.9 million and $154.2 million, respectively, leading to increases in interest income of $5.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively.  
    
  Interest Expense.    Interest expense increased by   $8.9 million  , or   56.4%  , to   $24.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $15.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits, which was driven by increased volume in all deposit products, including a $412.9 million increase in the average balance of savings and money market deposits and a $343.8 million increase in the average balance of time deposits.  Additionally, the average rate paid on all deposit categories increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , which included an eight basis point increase in the average rate paid on savings and money market deposits.  Interest expense on borrowings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased by $4.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the issuance of $75.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes by the Company in November 2015, as well as a 22 basis point increase in the average rate paid on borrowings.   
    
  Net Interest Income.    Net interest income increased by   $30.9 million  , or   17.4%  , to   $208.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $177.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The net interest margin decreased by   21   basis points to   3.82%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   4.03%   for the same period last year. The net interest rate spread decreased by   23   basis points to   3.68%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.91%   for the same period last year. The average yield on earning assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.27%  , a  
  
   41 

12 basis point decrease from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related accretion income recorded during the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points due to higher borrowing costs.  
  Provision for Credit Losses.    The provision for credit losses was   $19.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $4.8 million   from   $14.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily related to increased qualitative reserve factors applied to the Energy portfolio over the 2016 period due to the impact of continued pressure on the price of oil and gas. This ongoing pressure on oil and gas prices resulted in continued economic uncertainty and regulatory concerns surrounding energy loans.  Also, over the past year, risk rating downgrades on energy loans have increased, primarily in the special mention category, which consists entirely of performing loans.  The allowance for loan losses allocated to energy loans at September 30, 2016 totaled $16.1 million, up $11.2 million from $4.9 million at September 30, 2015. 
    
  Additionally, the increase in loan loss reserves and provision expense compared to the 2015 period resulted from increased organic loan production, as well as loans acquired through the merger with LegacyTexas Group, Inc. that were re-underwritten following completion of the merger.  For more information about the Company's allowance for loan losses, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 - Allowance for Loan Losses" contained in Item 2 of this report.   Provision for credit losses also included a $1.2 million expense recorded to establish a reserve for credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments, which resulted from the expansion of our lending business, as well as recent increased diversification of the types of off-balance sheet commitments offered by the Company. 
  Non-interest Income.    Non-interest income increased by   $6.4 million  , or   19.4%  , to   $39.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $33.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The increase in non-interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to increases in service charges and other fees and gain on sale and disposition of assets. A   $3.1 million   increase in gain on sale and disposition of assets resulted from a $3.9 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2016 on the sale of two buildings, as well as a gain of $1.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016 on the sale of the Company's insurance subsidiary operations, partially offset by a loss of $1.5 million on the sale of the Company's FHA portfolio.  The   $3.9 million   increase in service charges and other fees included a $1.9 million increase in commercial loan fee income (consisting of syndication, arrangement, non-usage and pre-payment fees), a $1.0 million increase in debit card interchange income and a $778,000 increase in title insurance premiums.  The increases in services charges and other fees and gain on sale and disposition of assets were partially offset by a $527,000 decline in other non-interest income primarily due to $810,000 less income recorded in 2016 from insurance activities due to the above-mentioned sale of the Company s insurance subsidiary operations.   Other non-interest income for 2016 also included a $662,000 net decrease in the CRA Funds, compared to a $417,000 net decrease in the CRA Funds recorded in 2015. Partially offsetting these declines in other non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $457,000 in swap fee income recorded on interest rate derivative positions with our customers, with only $155,000 in comparable income recognized during the same period in 2015.  

42 

Non-interest Expense.    Non-interest expense increased by   $4.3 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $116.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $112.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  

The increase in non-interest expense included a   $2.8 million   increase in data processing expense primarily related to increased expenses for debit card issuance and processing services, as the Company has converted all debit cards to the EMV chip technology to assist with the reduction of future fraud, as well as a   $2.1 million   increase in other non-interest expense, which included a $1.6 million increase in debit card fraud losses in the 2016 period, and $259,000 in increased costs of tenant improvements on other real estate owned during 2016.  During 2016, the Company identified $1.3 million of the debit card fraud losses were directly related to a breach in a franchised restaurant s point of sale ( POS ) system that has been ongoing since the fall of 2015.  The Company has identified all compromised cards related to this breach, and all cards have been reissued prior to the end of the third quarter of 2016.   Outside professional services expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by   $674,000   compared to the 2015 period, primarily due to higher consulting and audit expenses in the 2016 period.  These increases to non-interest expense in the 2016 period were partially offset by   $1.6 million   in merger and acquisition costs related to the merger with LegacyTexas Group, Inc. that were recorded in the 2015 period.  Salaries and employee benefits expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by   $31,000  , primarily due to $1.6 million lower share-based compensation expense (including expense related to the Company's ESOP) caused by a decline in the Company's stock price in the 2016 period, as well as a lower number of shares allocated in the 2016 period under the Company's 2006 ESOP plan, due to the related loan which was paid off in September 2016 as scheduled.  Additionally, salary expense for the 2016 period was reduced by $4.6 million in additional deferred salary costs related to loan originations that will be accounted for over the lives of the related loans, $572,000 in reduced overtime and temporary personnel expenses due to the LegacyTexas Group, Inc. acquisition in 2015, and a $430,000 reduction attributable to the Company s insurance subsidiary operations, which was sold in the second quarter of 2016.  Offsetting these decreases were increased salary costs due to the increase in number of employees in the 2016 period, which increased salary expense by $3.5 million and 401K expenses by $476,000, as well as increased loan production in the 2016 period, which led to a $3.5 million increase in performance-based incentive accruals and commissions. 
      Income Tax Expense.    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   we recognized income tax expense of   $39.4 million   on our pre-tax income, which was an effective tax rate of   35.2%  , compared to income tax expense of   $29.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was an effective tax rate of   35.0%  .  The increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a significant difference between the book basis and tax basis of the LegacyTexas Insurance Services assets sold during the second quarter of 2016.

Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid 
  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. Also presented are the weighted average yields on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant spread. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
  The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. The change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier period to the change in average balances outstanding between periods. Changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Liquidity 
  Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business.  The Company relies on a number of different funding sources in order to meet its potential liquidity demands.  The primary funding sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio. 
  Management also has several secondary sources of funds available to meet potential liquidity demands.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had additional borrowing capacity of   $1.73 billion   with the FHLB and   $255.0 million   in federal funds lines of credit available with other financial institutions.  The Company may also use the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a source of short-term funding.  Federal Reserve Bank borrowing capacity varies based upon securities pledged to the discount window line.  At   September 30, 2016  , securities pledged had a collateral value of   $51.6 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had classified   66.2%   of its securities portfolio as available for sale (including pledged securities), providing an additional source of liquidity.  Management believes that because active markets exist and our securities portfolio is of high quality, our available for sale securities are marketable.  Selling participations in loans we originate, including portions of commercial real estate loans, creates another source of liquidity and allows us to manage borrower concentration risk as well as interest rate risk. 
  Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.  Short-term excess liquidity is generally placed in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks.  On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities. 
  Planning for the Company's normal business liquidity needs, both expected and unexpected, is done on a daily and short-term basis through the cash management function.  On a longer-term basis it is accomplished through the budget and strategic planning functions, with support from internal asset/liability management software model projections. 
  The Liquidity Committee monitors liquidity positions and projections. Liquidity contingency planning is added to the Committee's process by focusing on possible scenarios that would stress liquidity beyond the Bank's normal business liquidity needs.  These scenarios may include macro-economic and bank specific situations focusing on high probability-high impact, high probability-low impact, low probability-high impact, and low probability-low impact stressors. 
  Management recognizes that the factors and conditions leading up to and occurring during a liquidity stress event cannot be precisely defined or listed.  Nevertheless, management believes that liquidity stress events can be categorized into sources and uses of liquidity, and levels of severity, with responses that apply to various situations. 
  The Company, which is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity, had liquid assets of $24.6 million on an unconsolidated basis at   September 30, 2016  . In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders, funds paid out for Company stock repurchases, and payments on trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt held at the Company level.  The Company has the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. See  How We Are Regulated - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions  under Item 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K. 
  The Company uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its expenses, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments.  Total approved loan commitments (including Warehouse Purchase Program commitments, unused lines of credit and letters of credit) amounted to   $2.31 billion   and   $1.71 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  It is management's policy to offer deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions.  Based on this management strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the Company.  Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1.04 billion   with a weighted average rate of   0.71%  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents decreased by   $337.8 million  , or   54.9%  , to   $277.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $615.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Operating activities provided cash of   $137.6 million   and financing activities provided cash of   $617.2 million  , which was offset by cash used in investing activities of   $1.09 billion  .  Primary sources of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included proceeds from pay-offs of Warehouse Purchase Program loans totaling   $14.45 billion  , proceeds from FHLB advances of   $454.3 million   and a   $901.4  
  
   48 

million   increase in deposits.  Primary uses of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included originations of Warehouse Purchase Program loans totaling   $14.75 billion  , repayments on FHLB advances of   $759.9 million   and net fundings of loans held for investment totaling   $706.5 million  . 
  Please see Item 1A (Risk Factors) under Part 1 of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K for information regarding liquidity risk. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  The following table presents our longer term contractual obligations and commitments to extend credit to our borrowers, in aggregate and by payment due dates (not including any interest amounts). In addition to the commitments below, the Company had overdraft protection available to its depositors in the amount of   $86.0 million   and credit card guarantees outstanding in the amount of   $2.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 

1    FHLB advances and subordinated debt are shown at their contractual amounts. 
   2    Loans having no stated maturity are reported in the  Less than One Year  category. 
   3    In regards to unused capacity on Warehouse Purchase Program loans, the Company has established a maximum purchase facility amount, but reserves the right, at any time, to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by its mortgage banking company customers for any reason in the Company's sole and absolute discretion. 

49 

Capital Resources 
  Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Company and its subsidiary bank to maintain  well-capitalized  status under the FRB regulations.  Based on capital levels at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank and the Company were considered to be well-capitalized. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's equity totaled   $956.0 million  .  The Company's consolidated equity totaled   $866.8 million  , or   10.3%   of total assets, at   September 30, 2016  .  Warehouse Purchase Program loan volumes can increase significantly on the last day of the month, potentially leading to a significant difference between the ending and average balance of Warehouse Purchase Program loans. At   September 30, 2016  , Warehouse Purchase Program loans totaled   $1.35 billion  , compared to an average balance of   $1.13 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Because the capital ratios below are calculated using ending risk-weighted assets and Warehouse Purchase Program loans are risk-weighted at 100%, an end of period increase in these balances can significantly impact the Company's reported capital ratios.   

  Pursuant to new capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the other federal banking agencies, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity tier 1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels of common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses.  The new capital conservation buffer began to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets is required, which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's and the Bank's common equity tier 1 capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Asset/Liability Management 
  Our Risk When Interest Rates Change.   The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. However, market rates change over time. Like other financial institutions, our results of operations are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in market interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. 
  How We Measure Our Risk of Interest Rate Changes.   As part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we calculate and monitor our interest rate risk. In doing so, we analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their interest rates and contractual cash flows, timing of maturities, prepayment potential, repricing opportunities, and sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates. 
  The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings, reprice more rapidly or slowly, or at different rates (basis risk) than its interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities. 
  The Bank calculates interest rate risk by entering relevant contractual and projected information into its asset/liability management software simulation model. Data required by the model includes balance, rate, pay down schedule, and maturity. For items that contractually reprice, the repricing index, spread, and frequency are entered, including any initial, periodic, and lifetime interest rate caps and floors. 
  The Bank has adopted an asset and liability management policy. This policy sets the foundation for monitoring and managing the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on our results of operations. The Board of Directors sets the asset and liability policy for the Bank, which is implemented by the Asset/Liability Management Committee. 
  The purpose of the Asset/Liability Management Committee is to monitor, communicate, coordinate, and direct asset/liability management consistent with our business plan and board-approved policies. The Committee directs and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, growth, and profitability goals. 
  The Committee meets on a quarterly basis to, among other things, protect capital through earnings stability over the interest rate cycle, maintain our well-capitalized status, and provide a reasonable return on investment. The Committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of policy implementation and strategies to the Board of Directors at least quarterly.  Senior managers oversee the process on a daily basis. 
  A key element of the Bank s asset/liability management strategy is to protect earnings by managing the inherent maturity and repricing mismatches between its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank generally manages such earnings exposure through the addition of loans, investment securities and deposits with risk mitigating characteristics and by entering into appropriate term FHLB advance agreements. 
  As part of its efforts to monitor and manage interest rate risk, the Bank uses the economic value of equity ( EVE ) methodology adopted by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFEIC") as part of its capital regulations.  In essence, the EVE approach calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities.  In addition to monitoring selected measures of EVE, management also calculates and monitors potential effects on net interest income resulting from increases or decreases in market interest rates.  This approach uses the earnings at risk ( EAR ) methodology adopted by the Joint Agency Policy Statement on Interest Rate Risk as part of its capital regulations.  EAR calculates estimated net interest income using a flat balance sheet approach over a twelve month time horizon.  The EAR process is used in conjunction with EVE measures to identify interest rate risk on both a global and account level basis.  Management and the Board of Directors review EVE and EAR measurements at least quarterly to review historical trends, projected measurements, and to determine whether the Bank's interest rate exposure is within the limits established by the Board of Directors. 
  
   51 

The Bank's asset/liability management strategy sets acceptable limits for the percentage change in EVE and EAR given changes in interest rates.  For instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate increases or decreases of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points, the Bank's policy indicates that the change in EVE should not exceed a 5.00%, 10.00%, 12.50% and 15.00% decrease, respectively.  For an instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate increase or decrease of 100 basis points, the Bank's policy indicates that EAR should not decrease by more than 7%, and for increases of 200, 300, and 400 basis points, EAR should not decrease by more than 10%, 13%, and 15%, respectively. 
  As illustrated in the tables below, the Bank was within policy limits for all scenarios tested.  The tables presented below, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are internal analyses of our interest rate risk as measured by changes in EVE and EAR for instantaneous, parallel, and sustained shifts for all market rates and yield curves, in 100 basis point increments, up 400 basis points and down 100 basis points. 
  As illustrated in the tables below, our EVE would be negatively impacted by a parallel, instantaneous, and sustained increase in market rates. Such an increase in rates would negatively impact EVE as a result of the duration of assets, including loans and investments, being longer than the duration of liabilities, primarily deposit accounts and FHLB borrowings.  The decrease in sensitivity since December 2015 is primarily attributable to funding mix shifts.  Between the two periods, deposit funding has increased.  In rising rate environments, deposits are more beneficial to the Bank s EVE than comparable wholesale funding.  As illustrated in the table below, at   September 30, 2016  , our EAR would be positively impacted by a parallel, instantaneous, and sustained increase in market rates.  As market interest rates rise, variable liability rates are modeled to increase faster than assets mature or reprice.  Our EVE and EAR would also be negatively impacted by a 100 basis point decline in market rates. 

52 

The Bank's EVE was   $1.08 billion  , or   12.94%  , of the market value of portfolio assets as of   September 30, 2016  , a   $46.9 million     increase   from   $1.03 billion  , or   13.58%  , of the market value of portfolio assets as of   December 31, 2015  .  Based upon the assumptions utilized, an immediate 200 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a   $27.8 million   decrease in our EVE at   September 30, 2016   compared to a   $48.5 million   decrease at   December 31, 2015  , and would result in a   seven   basis point increase in our EVE ratio to   13.01%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to a   20   basis point decrease to   13.38%   at   December 31, 2015  .  An immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a   $32.4 million   decrease in our EVE at   September 30, 2016   compared to a   $30.8 million   decrease at   December 31, 2015  , and would result in a   61   basis point decrease in our EVE ratio to   12.33%   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to a   62   basis point decrease in our EVE ratio to   12.96%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Bank's projected EAR for the twelve months ending   September 30,     2017   is   $303.0 million  , compared to   $259.4 million   for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016.  Based on the assumptions utilized, an immediate 200 basis point increase in market rates would result in a   $4.7 million  , or   1.54%  ,   increase   in net interest income for the twelve months ending   September 30,     2017   compared to a   $3.4 million  , or   1.31%  , decrease for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016.  An immediate 100 basis point decrease in market rates would result in an   $8.8 million   decrease in net interest income for the twelve months ending   September 30,     2017   compared to a   $10.7 million   decrease for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016.  
  We have implemented a strategic plan to mitigate interest rate risk.  This plan includes the ongoing review of our current and projected mix of fixed rate versus variable rate loans, investments, deposits, and borrowings.  When available and appropriate, high quality adjustable rate assets are purchased or originated.  These assets generally may reduce our sensitivity to upward interest rate shocks.  On the liability side of the balance sheet, borrowings are added as appropriate.  These borrowings will be of a size and term so as to mitigate the impact of duration mismatches, reducing our sensitivity to upward interest rate shocks.  These strategies are implemented as needed and as opportunities arise to mitigate interest rate risk without materially sacrificing earnings. 
  In managing our mix of assets and liabilities, while considering the relationship between long and short term interest rates, market conditions, and consumer preferences, we may place somewhat greater emphasis on maintaining or increasing the Bank s net interest margin than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities. 
  Management also believes that at times the increased net income which may result from a mismatch in the actual maturity, repricing, or duration of its asset and liability portfolios can provide sufficient returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases or decreases in interest rates which may result from such a mismatch. Management believes that the Bank s level of interest rate risk is acceptable under this approach. 
  In evaluating the Bank s exposure to market interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics, their interest rate drivers may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates (basis risk). Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates over the life of the asset (time to initial interest rate reset; interest rate reset frequency; initial, periodic, and lifetime caps and floors). Further, in the event of a significant change in market interest rates, loan and securities prepayment and time deposit early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the table above. Assets with prepayment options and liabilities with early withdrawal options are being monitored, with assumptions stress tested on a regular basis. Current market rates and customer behavior are being considered in the management of interest rate risk. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. The Bank considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk. Of note, the current historically low interest rate environment has resulted in asymmetrical interest rate risk. The interest rates on certain repricing assets and liabilities cannot be fully shocked downward. 
  The Board of Directors and management believe that the Bank s ability to successfully manage and mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk is strengthened by several key factors. For example, the Bank manages its balance sheet duration and overall interest rate risk by placing a preference on originating and retaining adjustable rate loans.  In addition, the Bank borrows at various maturities from the FHLB to mitigate mismatches between the asset and liability portfolios. Furthermore, the investment securities portfolio is used as a primary interest rate risk management tool through the duration and repricing targeting of purchases and sales.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
  While the Company believes the present design of its disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goals, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures.  The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud.  A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual actions of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
