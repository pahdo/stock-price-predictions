FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Subject to Section 21 E, of the exchange Act, this Annual Report
on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on our current goals, plans, expectations,
assumptions, estimates and predictions regarding the Company. 

When used in this Annual Report, the words  plan ,
 believes,   continues,   expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends ,
 should,   would,   could,  or  may,  and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward looking statements. 

Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, events or growths to be materially different from any future
results, events or growths expressed or implied in this Annual Report. 

PART I  

Item 1: Description of Business:  

China Bull Management Inc was incorporated in the State of
Nevada on December 17, 2010 for the purpose to engage in the financial consulting business. None of the activities of the Company
or Mr. Chien require or will require:  

the Company or Mr. Chien to register with the SEC as an investment
adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or  

the Company or Mr. Chien to register with any U.S. state
securities regulator as an investment adviser.  

On December 31, 2010, our company was, through dividend distribution,
spin-off from USChina Channel Inc and got approval from FINRA, while the Company signed  Service Agreement  with China
Bull Holding Inc, to manage and take the beneficiary of the business of China Bull Holding which is a subsidiary and successor
of the legacy (such as assets and liabilities) of USChina Channel Inc., just after USChina Channel was acquired by China Education
International, Inc. ( China Education ).  

In January 30, 2011, the Board of the Company made following
decision:  

The existing shares of common stock on the record day of
January 30, 2011 will make 1 for 10 reverse split, and the fractional share will be round into an integer share.  

  The company offers Andrew Chien to purchase 900,000 shares
at par value $0.0001 and Kin Yuet Li 10,000 shares at par value $0.0001.  

The Board will sell of its shares to shareholders at $0.5
/share. The proceeds will be used in the company s operation.  

The stock restricted plan was well executed in 2011, and the
company obtained  

  $51,468 cash.   

Since there is no operation of China Bull Holding, Andrew
Chien, in July 2011, cancelled the business plan of China Bull Holding, and transferred all cash of $29,169.37 of China Bull Holding
into a bank deposit for this company as additional paid-in capital without any issuance of our shares under his authorization
of the service agreement. In summer of 2011, Mr. Chien dissolved China Bull Holding.  

Currently, Mr. Chien is the Chairman, CEO and CFO, and majority
shareholder of our company. We have the office at 665 Ellsworth Avenue, New Haven, CT 06511, telephone number (203) 844-0809.
The website of China Bull Management is the original website of USChina Channel Inc, at  

http://www.uschinachannel.net  

Our
    company had limited operation since established by offering XBRL filing and other services to customers, and continued to
    add strength and efforts in the marketing to explore more services for potential customers.    

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.
You should carefully consider the following risk factors and information provided in this annual report and other filings. If
any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected. 

Risks Relating To Our Business   

We commence operation recently and only have several customers
this time and our operating results are unpredictable.   

We have no operation history. Since the Company's formation in
December 2010, we only realized revenue of $35,920, including $1,880 in year 2013 so far. At this time, we have only several signed
customers. There are no history data upon which our investors could evaluate, estimate or predict our future revenue and profits.
The likelihood of our company's success must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently
encountered by companies in the early stages of development. 

We
will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, including the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which may not
be affordable to us.   

Rules
adopted by SEC pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting,
and attestation of this assessment by the Company s independent registered public accountants. These requirements make us
first to changes in corporate governance practices and to develop an adequate internal accounting control to budget, forecast,
manage and allocate our funds and account for them, while simultaneously developing and organizing with our business.  As
a developing stage company, these new rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs
and will require additional staff time. Since we have limited financial resources and staff time, we may not be affordable of
the increased costs, which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.  

In
2012 our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Currently the auditor resigned
due to his personal issue. So far the company has not located a new auditor yet   

Our only Director, Mr. Chien has limited financial capability,
and has to run additional business. He may be unable to devote his full time, or even honor all his financial commitment to the
Company, and eventually cause you to lose your investment if his outside business fails. Since May of 2013, the operation of the
business was interrupted by third party, and suffered fully damaged for over 3 years and beyond. Our auditor was resigned due
to his personal business rearrangement. Currently the company is in the process to seek new auditors, but not found a proper one
yet.  

We face strong competitors, which may force us out of business:  

We have no business insurance; any unanticipated events or expenses
may hurt our business substantially. In November of 2014, another third party wanted to control and dissolved this business, and
took all cash of this company without notice to shareholders and making any SEC filing to disclose. In December of 2015, the same
party took the desktop computer with installed software. All these created significant damage to the company. There was no other
choice except to rebuild the business.  

Our sole director controls our Company, which could result in
a lack of independence needed on certain issues and decisions, which impacting our shareholders.   

Our sole director, Mr. Chien, currently owns over 90% of the
outstanding common stock, remaining in control of the Company.  Although Mr. Chien is not party to any voting agreement,
he will be able to exert significant influence, or even authority, over matters requiring approval by our security holders, including
the election of all of our directors, control our operations, and inhibit your ability to change the Company's operations. Accordingly,
our shareholders will not have sufficient votes to cause the removal of Mr. Chien in his function as officer and director.  

As a result, we lack independent directors, independent board
committees and an independent audit committee financial expert. There can be no assurance that Mr. Chien will be completely independent
in the decisions he makes as our sole director and/or principal stockholder that will ensure protection of the rights of other
stockholders who purchase our securities in this offering.  

Such concentrated control of the Company may adversely affect
the price of our common stock in the event we merge with a third party or enter into a different transaction which requires shareholder
approval.  

Operations outside the United States may be affected by different
local politics, business and cultural factors, different regulatory requirements and prohibitions between jurisdictions.  

Risks Related to Our Securities    

We must comply with penny stock regulations, which could affect
the liquidity and price of our stock.  

On June 19, 2013, the FINRA announced to delete the trading at
the quotation of the OTCBB, of the common stock of this company due to the company failed to file 10-Q for the first quarter of
2013. Currently, the shares only can be traded in the pinksheet. 

The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices
in connection with transactions in  penny stocks.  Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less
than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on NASDAQ, provided that current
price and volume information 

with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by
the exchange or system. Prior to a transaction in a penny stock, a broker-dealer is required to: Deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document prepared by the SEC; Provide the customer with current bid and offers quotations for the penny stock; Explain the compensation
of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; Provide monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer's account; Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment
for the purchaser and receives the purchaser's consent; and Provide a written agreement to the transaction.  These requirements
may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our stock. Because our shares are subject
to the penny stock rules, you may find it more difficult to sell your shares. 

We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future, which may reduce your return on an investment in our common stock.  

We do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Any return on your investment would derive from an increase in the price of our stock, which may or may not occur. 

Investors may suffer substantial dilution or an unrealized loss
of seniority in preferences and privileges if we need to seek additional funding in the future.  

We have authorized 75 million of
shares with only about over 1 millions of shares outstanding. If we desire to raise additional capital in the future because we
will experience losses, and has little assets in our current operations, or we need to expand our operations, then we may have
to issue additional equity, preferred securities or convertible debt securities, which may not need the approval of current shareholders.
The issuance of new shares would cause the buyers in this offering to suffer dilution of their ownership percentage. The dilution
may be substantial because if maximum 75 million would have issued, the dilution would be approximately seventy-five times, or
the current shareholder's ownership would reduce to about 1/75. In addition, it is possible that any future securities could grant
new shareholders rights, preferences, and/or privileges that are different from this offering  .  

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments  

None. 

Item 2. Description of Property:  

The Company does not own or lease offices or property except some
necessary computer relative equipment and software for operation. Mr. Chien supplies the Company with office space and other office
equipment except of the computer related equipment on rent-free. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings:

c.   
       Dividends.    

On November 12, 2012, the Board of Directors of our company
made decision: to purchase 1,108,596 adjusted shares of common stock of USChina Channel Inc (note: this is new company with the
old name of USChina Channel Inc which became vacate after USChina Channel was acquired by China Education) on par value $0.0001
per share for aggregate price of $110.86. 

The share offering of USChina Channel Inc to China Bull Management
Inc was relative to the two companies  close relations of the sole control interests of Andrew Chien, not involving any
public stock offering such as public solicits including advertisement, and was exempted from the registration requirement due

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation:   

We are a developing stage company, and just began some operation.
We are in the stage to investigate market and build our business model. 

We purchased hardware and software for producing XBRL project
in enhances our capability of a SEC Edgar file agency for customers. 

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31,
2013  

We had revenue of $1,800 in fiscal year 2013, compared with $19,620
in 2012; and the revenue decreased was due to Chien s incapable to serve customer. The net loss was $(1,952) in 2013 compared
with loss of (2,745) in 2012. The loss was due to the expenses in stock transfer agency fee and equipment depreciation. 

Liquidity  

We believe our current cash position of $ 73,315 can meet our
operation requirement in the next twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our financial statements and related public
financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have
an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information
contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe
our use if estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant
estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. 

Our significant accounting policies are
summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013. While all these significant accounting
policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined
to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to
use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that
given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this
report. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In December 2010, FASB issued an amendment
to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. The amendments in this ASU specify that if
a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity
as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior
annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the
nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in
the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early
adoption is permitted. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s financial position
and results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:  None. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

Interest Rates:   

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our short-term investments; thus, fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value
of these securities. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $ 73,315 in cash and cash equivalents. 

Inflation:  

We believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our
operations to date.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls:  

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Company s Principal Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as  of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure  

controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s CEO and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for
the Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management
and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2012, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting was effective for the purposes for which it is intended.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's
report in this annual report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:   

Based
upon their evaluation of our controls, the CEO and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations
noted above, the disclosure controls are effective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to us is
made known to management on a timely basis during the period when our reports are being prepared. There were no changes in our
internal controls that occurred during the fiscal year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls.

We currently have no formal employment agreements or other contractual
arrangements with our Officer and Director, or anyone else regarding the commitment of time or the payment of salaries or other
remuneration. 

 Mr. Chien, our sole operator, will be compensated in the form
of a service fee or charge paid from revenues generated by the Company's customers. The amount of his service charge is based
upon: (1) primary responsibilities, (2) financial performance of the Company, (3) expected future financial performance of the
Company and (4) any other factors that are determined by the board of directors. The commencement of such compensation to Mr.
Chien will also be determined at the discretion of our board of directors (currently, Chien is the sole director). The primary
consideration when determining the timing of payments to Mr. Chien, if any, will be the financial condition of the Company. Specifically,
we anticipate the board to authorize payment only when the Company realizes positive cash flow in any quarterly fiscal period.
Mr. Chien's service charge will not exceed $150,000 in any fiscal year. Mr. Chien will perform his compensation following the
principles as mentioned above. There is no written agreement of Mr. Chien s compensation. In the year of 2011, our company

   NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   December
31, 2013   

1. ORGANIZATIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

China Bull Management Inc was incorporated in Nevada on December
17, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada, for the purpose of providing management consulting services to the small or median
sized private companies in China or other emerging countries that want to look for business partners, or agencies, or financing
resources, or to become public through IPO or reverse merger in the United States, or Canada. 

The Company was a subsidiary of China Education International (former
name: USChina Channel Inc.), and spun off on December 31, 2010. 

The Company is in the development stage with minimal operations. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Accounting  

The accompanying audited financial statements and related notes
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for annual financial information, and with the rules and regulations of SEC to Form 10-K and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. 

The Company selected December 31 as year-end. 

Development Stage Company  

The Company is a development stage company as defined by section
915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company has recognized no revenue since inception, and is still devoting
substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced. All losses
accumulated since inception, have been considered as part of the Company s development stage activities. 

Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 

Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

   Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 

   Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable
inputs and not corroborated by market data. 

The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2012, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations
that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting
date for the period from December 17, 2010 (inception) through December 31, 2013. 

Income Taxes 

The Company will account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed
or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides 

guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties
on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to
its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

Net Loss Per Common Share 

Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. There
were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2013. 

3. GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial
statements are presented on a going concern basis. 

 The Company had minimal operations during
the period from December 17 (date of inception) to December 31, 2013 and generated little revenues of $35,920 including $1,800
in this year, and the Company's current asset of $76,717 is limited.  This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. 

 Continuation of the Company as a going concern
dependents upon obtaining additional working capital, and generating substantial revenue and profits. Management is doing the
best to find solution. 

 Further, the operation of this company was haled since May of 2013
by a third party. 

4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS 

There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional
shares of common stocks. 

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: 

None. 

6. INCOME TAXES 

None. 

7. NET OPERATING LOSSES 

As of December 31, 2013, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward
of $(1,952) or $(0.00) per share. Net operating loss carryforward expires twenty years from the date the loss was incurred. 

8. STOCK TRANSACTIONS                            None. 

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 

The stockholders' equity section of the Company contains the following
classes of capital stock as of December 31, 2013: 

Common stock, $0.0001 par value; 75,000,000 shares authorized;
1,108,596 shares issued and outstanding and 96,160 with SEC registration. 

10. GIFTS DISTRIBUTION OF USCHINA CHANNEL INC S SHARE 

On November 12, 2012, the Board of Directors of this company
made decision: to purchase 1,138,596 shares of common stock of USChina Channel Inc (note: this is new company with the old name
of USChina Channel Inc which became vacate after USChina Channel was acquired by China Education) on par value $0.0001 per share
for aggregate price of $113.86. 

The share offering of USChina Channel Inc to China Bull Management
Inc was relative to the two companies  close relations of the sole control interests of Andrew Chien, not involving any
public stock offering such as public solicits including advertisement, and was exempted from the registration requirement due
to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

These purchased shares distributed to the shareholders of
our company on one to one basis that is every outstanding share of China Bull Management Inc got one share distribution of USChina
Channel Inc as a special dividend, or gift from the Company. 

The record of this dividend distribution was November 29, 2012;
and the payment day February 6, 2013.

to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting. 

5. As the registrant's certifying officer I have disclosed, based
on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process summarize and report financial information; and 

b) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
