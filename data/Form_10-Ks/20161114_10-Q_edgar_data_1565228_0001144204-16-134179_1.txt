     NOTES TO THE
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

   (Unaudited)   

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Description of Business  

xG Technology, Inc. (the  Company ),
a Delaware corporation, has developed a broad portfolio of innovative intellectual property designed to enhance wireless communications.
The Company s intellectual property is embedded in proprietary software algorithms designed to offer cognitive interference
mitigation and spectrum access solutions to organizations in a wide variety of industries, including national defense and rural
broadband, which represent the primary vertical markets that the Company is initially targeting. 

On January 29, 2016, the Company completed
the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities that constitute the business of Integrated Microwave Technologies, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (  IMT  ), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and between the Company
and IMT (the   Asset Purchase Agreement  ). Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
Company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of IMT in connection with, necessary for or material to IMT s
business of designing, manufacturing and supplying of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (COFDM) microwave transmitters
and receivers serving the broadcast, sports and entertainment, military, aerospace and government markets (the   Transaction  ).
The purchase price for the Transaction was $3,000,000, which was initially paid through: (i) the issuance of a promissory note
in the principal amount of $1,500,000 due March 31, 2016 (the   Initial Payment Note  ); and (ii) the issuance
of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,500,000 due July 29, 2017 (the   Deferred Payment Note  ,
and together with the Initial Payment Note, the  Payment Notes ). On April 12, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset
Purchase Modification Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Modification Agreement ) with IMT, which terminated the Payment
Notes, cancelling all principal due or to become due thereunder, and in their stead obligated the Company to: (i) upon execution
of the Asset Purchase Modification Agreement, pay to IMT $500,000 plus any interest accumulated on the Payment Notes prior to their
being cancelled; and (ii) prior to December 31, 2016, deliver to IMT shares (the  Series D Shares ) of the Company s
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (the  Series D Preferred Stock ) having an aggregate
value of cash proceeds ( Cash Proceeds ), upon conversion of such Series D Shares into shares of common stock underlying
such Series D Shares, of not less than $2,500,000, plus interest accrued thereon at 9% per annum, with such Series D Shares to
be issued in tranches of $250,000 (the  Tranches ). If IMT does not realize Cash Proceeds of at least $2,500,000 by
December 31, 2016, the Company will be required to either issue additional shares of common stock to IMT, or otherwise raise additional
funds to cover the shortfall. Cash Proceeds are determined by the cash or cash equivalents received by IMT upon sale of the shares
of common stock issued to IMT upon conversion of any Series D Shares, net of any transaction costs or expenses. Each time a new
Tranche is issued, IMT shall be obligated to provide evidence of its current Cash Proceeds and the remaining amount of the $2,500,000
(plus interest) due. The first Tranche was due within ten days of the execution of the Asset Purchase Modification Agreement, and
subsequent Tranches are due upon notice from IMT that IMT has disposed of the Series D Shares of the prior Tranche. The Company
paid IMT $500,000 plus accrued interest on April 15, 2016. As of November 14, 2016, 5,750,000 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock have been issued, of which 3,750,000 have been converted into 3,125,010 shares of common stock. 

IMT comprises the microwave brands Nucomm
and RF Central offering customers worldwide complete video solutions. Nucomm is a premium brand of digital broadcast microwave
video systems. RF Central is an innovative brand of compact microwave video equipment for licensed and license-free sports and
entertainment applications. IMT is a trusted provider of mission-critical wireless video solutions to state, local and federal
police departments. The xG subsidiary, Integrated Microwave Technology, LLC was formed in February 2016 as a Delaware limited liability
company. 

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Delisting Notice  

On September 29, 2015, the Company received
written notice from NASDAQ notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in NASDAQ
Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the NASDAQ, as the closing bid price for the Company s common stock was
below $1.00 per share for the last thirty (30) consecutive business days. In accordance with NASDAQ listing rules, the Company
was afforded 180 calendar days, or until March 28, 2016, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Company
was unable to regain compliance with the bid price requirement by March 28, 2016. 

On March 29, 2016, the Company received written
notice (the  Notice ) from NASDAQ that it had granted the Company an additional 180 calendar days, or until September
26, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued listing on NASDAQ, pursuant
to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(ii). 

The NASDAQ determination to grant the second
compliance period was based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and
all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the NASDAQ, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and the Company s
written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split,
if necessary. 

To regain compliance, the bid price of the
Company s common stock must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business
days at any time during the second 180-day compliance period. On June 20, 2016, the Company effected a 1-for-12 reverse stock split
of its outstanding common stock as a measure to regain compliance. On August 19, 2016, the Company filed a Definitive Proxy for
a special shareholders meeting to be held on September 22, 2016, asking for the shareholders to grant the Board of Directors approval
to execute another reverse stock split, if necessary. The meeting was adjourned to November 16, 2016 to allow additional time for
the stockholders to vote on the proposal. 

On September 27, 2016, the Company received
a determination letter (the  Letter ) from the staff of NASDAQ stating that the Company has not regained compliance
with the NASDAQ minimum bid price of $1.00 requirement for continued listing set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Pursuant
to the Letter, unless the Company requests a hearing to appeal this determination by October 4, 2016, the Company s common
stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, trading of the Company s common stock will be suspended at the opening
of business on October 6, 2016, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove
the Company s common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. 

The Company has requested a hearing before
a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the  Panel ). The Company will be asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance
with the minimum bid price requirement of Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Company s plan will need to include a discussion of
the events that the Company believes will enable it to timely regain compliance with such requirement. The Company intends to submit
a plan that it believes will be sufficient to permit the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. While
the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of the Company s common stock is stayed, and the Company s
common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. 

There can be no assurance that the Panel will
grant the Company s request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Company s common stock
ceases to be listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company would expect that its common stock would be traded on
one of the three tiered marketplaces of the OTC Markets Group. 

In the event that the Company s common
stock is delisted from the NASDAQ, and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of its common stock
could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as
the Pink Sheet or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price
quotations for, the Company s common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in the Company s coverage by
securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of its common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult
for the Company to raise additional capital if it is not listed on a major exchange. 

Reverse Stock Split  

On June 10, 2016, the Company s Board
of Directors (the  Board ) approved a resolution to amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and to authorize
the Company to effect a reverse split of the Company s outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-12. On June 20, 2016,
the Company effected the 1-for-12 reverse stock split. Upon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every 12 shares of outstanding
common stock decreased to one share of common stock. Throughout this quarterly report the reverse split has been retroactively
applied to all periods presented. 

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these
financial statements do not include all information or notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements as filed on the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. 

In the opinion of management, the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company's financial
position as of September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and the results of its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of results for the
full year ending December 31, 2016. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of xG Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary since the date the acquisition of IMT was completed.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications  

Certain reclassifications have been made
in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for comparative purposes. These reclassifications have no effect on the results
of operations or financial position of the Company. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves
and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance relating
to the Company s deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and derivative instruments, and debt discounts and the valuation
of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition of IMT. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenues when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably
assured. Revenues from management and consulting, time-and-materials service contracts, maintenance agreements and other services
are recognized as the services are provided or at the time the goods are shipped and title has passed. 

Loss Per Share  

The Company computes basic net loss per
share by dividing net loss per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted loss per share, if presented, would include
the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the
 treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable. The computation of basic loss per share at
September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes the potentially dilutive securities for 13.6 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively,
underlying the options, warrants, convertible debt and convertible preferred stock, as their effect on loss per share would be
anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

GAAP requires disclosing the fair value
of financial instruments to the extent practicable for financial instruments which are recognized or unrecognized in the balance
sheet. The fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not necessarily representative of the amount that could
be realized or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax consequences of realization or settlement. 

In assessing the fair value of financial
instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions, which are based on estimates of market conditions and risks
existing at the time. For certain instruments, including, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the Company
estimated that the carrying amount approximated fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. All debt is based
on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities and approximates fair value. 

GAAP establishes a hierarchy for inputs
used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use on unobservable inputs by requiring
that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are
inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is described below: 

Level 1      
      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2    
      Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.   

Level 3    
      Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.   

Subsequent Events  

Management has evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring
through the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and determined that no events or transactions are
required to be disclosed herein, except as disclosed. 

Recently Issued Accounting Principles  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations . The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation
of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 are effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-08 on the condensed consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Under
ASU No. 2016-09, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital
( APIC ). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in
the income statement and the APIC pools will be eliminated. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates the requirement that excess
tax benefits be realized before 

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

companies can recognize them. ASU No. 2016-09
also requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a
financing activity. Furthermore, ASU No. 2016-09 will increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards
and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income
tax withholding obligation. An employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation will now be allowed to withhold shares
with a fair value up to the amount of taxes owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee s applicable jurisdiction(s).
ASU No. 2016-09 requires a company to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory
income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Under current U.S. GAAP, it was not specified
how these cash flows should be classified. In addition, companies will now have to elect whether to account for forfeitures on
share-based payments by (1) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or (2) estimating the number of awards expected to
be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change, as is currently required. The amendments of this ASU are effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted but all of the guidance must be adopted
in the same period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance is an update to ASC 606 and provides clarity on:
identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. For public companies, ASU No. 2016-10 is effective for annual
periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact that ASU No. 2016-10 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients 
, which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of
sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of this standard and assessing its impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and
disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows: Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which eliminates
the diversity in practice related to classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding
or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company has not yet determined the effect of
the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic
842) . ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should
recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is
permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity).
Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance.  The Company
has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with GAAP which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. At September 30, 2016,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $200.1 million and a net loss of approximately $11.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has been funding its business principally through debt and equity financings
and advances from related parties. The Company continues to experience significantly long sales cycles in certain areas, most notably,
in the first responder, public safety, military and rural telco markets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The ability to recognize revenue and ultimately
cash receipts is contingent upon, but not limited to, acceptable performance of the delivered equipment and services. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital and/or close on some of its revenue producing opportunities in the near term, the carrying
value of its assets may be materially impacted. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recovery
and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3   ACQUISITION OF IMT  

Acquisition of Integrated Microwave
Technologies, LLC   

The fair value of the purchase
consideration issued to the sellers of IMT was allocated to the net tangible assets acquired and to the separately
identifiable intangibles on January 29, 2016, the date the acquisition closed. The excess of the aggregate fair value of the
net tangible assets and identified intangible assets has been treated as a gain on bargain purchase in accordance with ASC
805. The purchase price allocation was based, in part, on management s knowledge of IMT s business and the
results of a third party appraisal commissioned by management. The third party appraisal commissioned by management was
finalized during the second quarter which resulted in the modification of the fair values estimated of certain assets
acquired as compared to the preliminary amounts initially reported. 

The following presents the unaudited pro-forma
combined results of operations of the Company with IMT as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015. 

The unaudited pro-forma results of operations
are presented for information purposes only. The unaudited pro-forma results of operations are not intended to present actual results
that would have been attained had the acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2015 or to project potential operating results
as of any future date or for any future periods. 

NOTE 4   INTANGIBLE ASSETS

 Upon the occurrence of certain triggering
events (including if the Series B Preferred Stock or common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock is not freely tradeable
without restriction; the failure of the common stock to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or other national securities exchange;
and bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation proceedings instituted against us shall not be dismissed in thirty (30)
days or the voluntary commencement of such proceedings by us),
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have  

NOTE 7   PREFERRED STOCK (continued)  

the right to require the Company, by
written notice, to redeem all or any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a price equal to the greater of (i) 125% of
the conversion amount to be redeemed and (ii) the product of (a) the conversion amount divided by the lower of (x) $3.00 or
(y) 87.5% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our common stock during the five (5) consecutive trading-day period
ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice multiplied by (b)
125% of the greatest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date
immediately preceding such triggering event and ending on the date the Company makes the entire redemption payment to the
holder of Series B Preferred Stock;  provided  that the conversion price will not be less than the Floor Price, which
Floor Price will not be adjusted for stock splits, share combinations and similar transactions. The Floor Price is $0.10 per
share. 

February 2016 Financing   

On February 29, 2016, the
Company closed a public offering of 296,389 Units, at a price of $12.00 per Unit, each of which consists of one share of
Series B Preferred Stock (as amended) and 0.5 of a Warrant to purchase one share of its common stock at an exercise price of
$2.52 per Warrant. The Company received approximately $3,556,660 in gross proceeds from the offering, and incurred costs of
$604,000 which were included in temporary equity on the grant date. Roth Capital Partners acted as sole placement agent for the
offering. As further discussed in Note 9, the warrants issued in connection with the February 2016 Financing contain
provisions permitted the holders to net cash settle upon certain events at the Company. As such, the warrants were accounted
for as derivative liabilities. Of the total gross proceeds received by the Company, $231,000 were allocated to the fair value
of the warrant liabilities on the date of the transaction. 

In connection with the February 2016 offering,

stock. As of September 30, 2016, none of the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding. As a result of the conversion, the Company
recorded contractual and deemed dividends of $1,808,000, which represents the difference in the fair value of the common stock

As previously disclosed in Note 1, in
connection with the acquisition of IMT, the Company is obligated to issue to IMT an amount of Series D Convertible Shares
equal to at least $2,500,000. On the date the Asset Purchase Modification Agreement was completed, the fair value of the
obligation to IMT was determined to be $2,500,000 and was included in Series D Preferred Stock Issuable on the condensed
consolidated balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 3,750,000 shares of its
Series D Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares were then converted into 1,458,338 shares of the Company s common
stock.  

Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Modification Agreement, the Company is required to issue Series D Shares to IMT on an on-going basis until IMT

(continued)  

Warrants and Options   

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $39,000 and $264,000, respectively, as stock compensation expense from the amortization

and $432,000, respectively as stock compensation expense from the amortization of stock options issued in prior periods. 

A summary of the warrant and option activity
is as follows: 

Warrants   

Options   

NOTE 9   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

Each of the warrants issued in connection
with the August 2015 underwritten offering, the February 2016 Series B Preferred Stock Offering, May 2016 Financing and July 2016
Financing have been accounted for as derivative liabilities as each of the warrants contain a net cash settlement provision whereby,
upon certain fundamental events, the holders could put the warrants back to the Company for cash.  

The following are the key assumptions that
were used in connection with the valuation of the warrants exercisable into common stock as of September 30, 2016: 

Level 3 liabilities are valued using unobservable
inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the liabilities. For fair value
measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company s accounting and finance department, who
report to the Chief Financial Officer, determine its valuation policies and procedures. The development and determination of the
unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s
accounting and finance department and are approved by the Chief Financial Officer. 

Level 3 Valuation Techniques:  

Level 3 financial liabilities consist of
the derivative liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value
requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. The Company deems financial
instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions to be derivative instruments. In accordance with ASC Topic 480,  Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity , the fair value of these warrants is classified as a liability on the Company s Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets because, according to the terms of the warrants, a fundamental transaction could give rise to an obligation of the
Company to pay cash to its warrant holders. Such instruments do not have fixed settlement provisions and have been recorded as
derivative liabilities. Corresponding changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are recognized in earnings on the
Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in each subsequent period. 

The Company s derivative liabilities
are carried at fair value and were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable
inputs. In order to calculate fair value, the Company uses a binomial model style simulation, as the value of certain features
of the warrant derivative liabilities would not be captured by the standard Black-Scholes model. 

NOTE 9   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES (continued)  

The following table sets forth a summary
of the changes in the fair value of our Level 3 financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

NOTE 10   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

MB Technology Holdings, LLC   

On April 29, 2014, the Company entered
into a management agreement (the  Management Agreement ) with MB Technology Holdings, LLC ( MBTH ), pursuant
to which MBTH agreed to provide certain management and financial services to the Company for a monthly fee of $25,000. The Management
Agreement was effective January 1, 2014. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred
fees related to the Management Agreement of $75,000 and $225,000, respectively. Roger Branton, the Company s Chief Financial
Officer, and George Schmitt, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, are directors of MBTH, and
Richard Mooers, a director of the Company, is the CEO and a director of MBTH. 

The Company has agreed to award MBTH a
3% cash success fee if MBTH arranges financing for the Company, arranges a merger, consolidation or sale by the Company of substantially
all of its assets. The Company incurred approximately $436,000 as a success fee for equity financings that closed between August
1, 2015 and September 30, 2016, which was recorded as General and Administrative expense as consulting fees. 

On March 3, 2016, our Board of
Directors approved the issuance of up to $300,000 in shares of common stock to MBTH as compensation for financial services in
connection with the IMT acquisition. Such shares of common stock were to be issued to MBTH in an initial tranche in the
amount of $150,000 on March 15, 2016, which shares of common stock have not yet been issued and a second tranche to MBTH of
up to $150,000 in shares of common stock if IMT achieves certain performance goals by December 31, 2016. On August 10, 2016,
the disinterested members of the Board of Directors believing it to be in the best interest of the Company, resolved to
pay the award in cash instead of shares. The Company accrued $150,000 in the due to related party balance owed to MBTH and
has paid these cash fees as of the date of this report.

Overview  

The overarching strategy of xG Technology,
Inc. is to design, develop and deliver advanced wireless communications solutions across its business units that provide customers
in our target markets with enhanced levels of reliability, mobility, performance and efficiency in their business operations and
missions. 

xG Technology is comprised of two business
units: our xMax unit, which provides product and service solutions marketed under the xMax brand name, and Integrated Microwave
Technology (  IMT  ) our wholly owned subsidiary, which provides product and service solutions marketed
under the brand names Nucomm, RF Central and IMT. Nucomm is a premium brand of digital broadcast microwave video systems. RF Central
is a well-established brand of compact microwave video equipment for licensed and license-free sports and entertainment applications.
The IMT products are focused on providing mission-critical wireless video solutions to state, local and federal police departments.
While the brands of xMax and IMT are managed as separate reporting units and operate independently, there is considerable brand
interaction, owing to complementary market focus, compatible product and technology development roadmaps, and solution integration
opportunities. 

xMax:  

Our xMax unit develops, manufactures and
sells equipment that utilizes a broad portfolio of innovative intellectual property to enhance wireless communications. Our intellectual
property is embedded in proprietary software algorithms that offer cognitive interference mitigation and spectrum access solutions
for numerous applications using commercial off-the-shelf devices. The implementation
of our cognitive radio intellectual property is  

called   xMax  . The xMax product and service suite includes
access points, mobile switching centers, network management systems, deployment tools and proactive customer support. Customers
within this market include telecommunication services, public safety, telemedicine as well as the U.S. Government and Department
of Defense. 

Given the proliferation of smartphones,
in 2013, the Company introduced an improved product line that could handle both voice and data services. These products, the CN1100
Access Point (  CN1100  ), the CN5100 Mobile Hotspot (  CN5100  ), and the CN3100
Vehicle Modem (  CN3100  ), are able to communicate with any Wi-Fi enabled commercial off-the-shelf device. 

We believe that the wireless communications
industry is facing a   spectrum crisis   because the demand for flexible, affordable voice and data access
continues to increase rapidly while the amount of available spectrum remains relatively constant. We have developed frequency-agnostic
cognitive radio solutions to address this increasing demand by eliminating the need to acquire scarce and expensive licensed radio
spectrum, and thus ideally lowering the total cost of ownership for wireless broadband access. With fast-growing demand straining
network capacity, our intellectual property is also designed to help wireless broadband network operators make more efficient use
of their existing spectrum allocations. 

We believe that the xMax system is the
only commercially available cognitive radio network system that includes our interference mitigation and spatial processing technologies.
These proprietary technologies enable our xMax system to increase capacity on already crowded airwaves by improving interference
tolerance, thereby enabling the delivery of higher Quality of Service (  QoS  ) than other technologies
that would not be able to cope with the interference. We believe that the xMax system will also, when operating on more than one
radio channel, deliver dynamic spectrum access by using our patented self-organizing network techniques. Furthermore, the xMax
system can be used to provide additional capacity to licensed spectrum by identifying and utilizing unused bandwidth within the
licensed spectrum. Although currently designed to operate within the 902   928 MHz unlicensed band of spectrum, our system
is frequency agnostic. xMax also serves as a mobile voice over internet protocol (  VoIP  ) and broadband
data system that utilizes an end-to-end Internet Protocol (  IP  ) system architecture. 

The xMax system allows mobile operators
to utilize free, unlicensed 902   928 MHz ISM band spectrum (which spectrum is available in all of the Americas except French
Guiana) instead of purchasing scarce and expensive licensed spectrum. Our xMax system will also enable enterprises to set up a
mobile communications network in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

On January 29, 2016, we completed the acquisition
of certain assets and liabilities of IMT, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement by and between us and IMT. Pursuant to the terms
of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of IMT in connection with, necessary
for or material to IMT s business of designing, manufacturing and supplying of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(COFDM) microwave transmitters and receivers serving the broadcast, sports and entertainment, military, aerospace and government
markets (the   Transaction  ). The purchase price for the Transaction was $3,000,000, which was paid through:
(i) the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,500,000 due March 31, 2016 (the   Initial Payment
Note  ); and (ii) the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $1,500,000 due July 29, 2017 (the   Deferred
Payment Note , and together, the  Payment Notes ). 

On April 12, 2016, we entered into an Asset
Purchase Modification Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Modification Agreement ) with IMT, which terminated the Payment
Notes, cancelling all principal due or to become due thereunder, and in their stead obligated us to: (i) upon execution of the
Asset Purchase Modification Agreement, pay to IMT $500,000 plus any interest accumulated on the Payment Notes prior to their being
cancelled; and (ii) prior to December 31, 2016, deliver to IMT shares (the  Series D Shares ) of the Company s
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (the  Series D Preferred Stock ) having an aggregate
value of cash proceeds ( Cash Proceeds ), upon conversion of such Series D Shares into shares of common stock underlying
such Series D Shares, of not less than $2,500,000, plus interest accrued thereon at 9% per annum, with such Series D Shares to
be issued in tranches of $250,000 (the  Tranches ). If IMT does not realize Cash Proceeds of at least $2,500,000 by
December 31, 2016, we will be required to either issue additional shares of common stock to IMT, or otherwise raise additional
funds to cover the shortfall. Cash Proceeds are determined by the cash or cash equivalents received by IMT upon sale of the shares
of common stock issued to IMT upon conversion of any Series D Shares, net of any transaction costs or expenses. Each time a new
Tranche is issued, IMT shall be obligated to provide evidence of its current Cash Proceeds and the remaining amount of the $2,500,000
(plus interest) due. The first Tranche was due within ten days of the execution of the Asset Purchase Modification Agreement, and
subsequent Tranches are due upon notice from IMT that IMT disposed of the Series D Shares of the prior Tranche. We paid IMT $500,000
plus accrued interest on April 15, 2016. As of November 14, 2016, 5,750,000 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock have
been issued, of which 3,750,000 have been converted into 3,125,010 shares of common stock.

Vislink PLC   

On October 13, 2016, we signed a binding
Letter of Intent ( LOI ) with Vislink PLC, an England and Wales public limited company (the  Seller  or
 Vislink ), regarding the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities relating to the hardware segment of Vislink
(the  Transaction ). The purchase price of the Transaction will be $16 million (the  Purchase Price ).
We are required to raise at least one-third of the Purchase Price and place it in a restricted account to be used for closing of
the Transaction within twenty (20) days of the receipt of pro-forma financial information (the  Financing Condition ).
The parties intend to negotiate and execute a definitive asset purchase and sale agreement for the Transaction in accordance with
the terms of the LOI. 

The definitive asset purchase and sale
agreement will include customary closing conditions including necessary approvals for an asset purchase of this size and scope.
We and the Seller have agreed not to initiate or enter into any discussion with any other prospective purchaser of the assets and/or
liabilities, or of the stock or business of Vislink prior to December 31, 2016. The LOI will terminate immediately if the Financing
Condition is not met.

Results of Operations  

Comparison for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues  

Revenues for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, were $1,913,000 and $4,497,000, respectively, representing an increase of $1,724,000 and $3,351,000,
respectively, from $189,000 and $1,146,000 in the corresponding periods in 2015. The revenue of $1,913,000 resulted from $1,851,000
from sales of equipment and $62,000 from engineering services for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which can be attributed
to the acquisition of IMT. The revenue of $4,497,000 resulted from $4,339,000 from sales of equipment and $158,000 from engineering
services during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Of the $4,497,000 in revenue, $154,000 was previously recorded as deferred
revenue. 

Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses  

Cost of Components and Personnel  

 Cost of components and personnel for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $970,000 and $2,210,000, respectively, representing an increase of $856,000
and $1,521,000 from $114,000 and $689,000 in the corresponding periods in 2015. Of the $970,000 and $2,210,000, $952,000 and $2,140,000
were based on the cost of components and the time allocated to the building of the products sold, and $18,000 and $53,000 were based
on the cost of the time allocated towards the engineering service agreement. Of the $114,000 and $689,000, $112,000 and $635,000
were based on the cost of components and the time allocated to the building of the products sold, and $2,000 and $54,000 were based
on the cost of the time allocated towards the engineering and consulting service agreement. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

 General and administrative expenses are
the expenses of operating the business on a daily basis. This includes salary, benefit expenses and payroll taxes, as well as the
costs of trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, professional services, facilities, general liability insurance,
and travel. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred aggregate expense of $2.3 million and
$6.7 million, respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $5.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing
an increase of $0.4 million, or 21%, for the three months, and $1.1 million, or 20%, for the nine months ending September 30, 2016. 

The three month increase of $0.4 million
is due to the inclusion of $0.9 million of general and administrative expenses as a result of the IMT acquisition on January 29,
2016. The increase was partially offset by decreases of $0.2 million in consulting fees associated with the Company s listing
on the NASDAQ Capital Market; $0.2 million in consulting fees due to cost cutting measures; and $0.1 million in stock based compensation
associated with the expensing of stock options. 

The nine month increase of $1.1 million
is due to the inclusion of $2.4 million of general and administrative expenses as a result of the IMT acquisition on January 29,
2016. The increase was partially offset by decreases of $0.4 million in consulting fees associated with the Company s listing
on the NASDAQ Capital Market; $0.4 million in consulting fees due to cost cutting measures; $0.1 million in travel expenses, $0.1
million in stock based compensation associated with the expensing of stock options; and $0.1 million in insurance expenses. 

Research and Development Expenses  

 Research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries, benefit expenses and payroll taxes, as well as costs for prototypes, facilities and travel. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred aggregate expenses of $1.4 million and $4.6 million, compared to
$1.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of
$0.4 million, or 40%, for the three months and $0.9 million, or 24%, for the nine months ending September 30, 2016. 

The three month increase of $0.4 million
is due to the Company not capitalizing any salaries associated with software development costs for the three months ending September
30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million of salaries associated with software development costs that were capitalized in the three months
ending September 30, 2015. Included in the three months ending September 30, 2016, is $0.2 million of research and development
expenses as a result of the IMT acquisition on January 29, 2016. After taking into account the non-capitalization of salaries associated
with software development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, total research and development costs decreased over
the period by $0.3 million with regard to payroll, due to a reduction in personnel. 

The nine month increase of $0.9 million
is due to the Company not capitalizing any salaries associated with software development costs for the three months ending September
30, 2016 compared to $1.7 million of salaries associated with software development costs that were capitalized in the nine months
ending September 30, 2016. Included in the nine months ending September 30, 2016, is $0.5 million of research and development expenses
as a result of the IMT acquisition on January 29, 2016. After taking into account the non-capitalization of salaries associated
with software development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, total research and development costs decreased over
the period by $1.0 million with regard to payroll and $0.1 million in insurances due to a reduction in personnel, $0.1 million
in stock based compensation associated with the expensing of stock options; and $0.1 million with regard to materials not used
for research and development purposes. 

We expect our research and development
costs to continue to decrease going forward as we implement additional cost saving measures in our current full-time, part-time
and contracted workforce. 

Amortization and Depreciation  

 Amortization and depreciation expenses
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, compared to $1.0 million
and $2.9 million, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization and depreciation expenses increased
$0.3 million, or 53%, from $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.3 million in the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Amortization and depreciation increased $1.2 million, or 41% from $2.9 million in the nine months ended September
30, 2015 to $4.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increases are due to the depreciation on the step-up
in valuation of certain assets of IMT in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other  

Other income for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, compared to $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The other expense of $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, represents the shortfall in proceeds on the Series D Preferred Stock that was associated with the acquisition of IMT. 

The changes in fair value of derivative
liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively. This is due
to the changes in our stock price subsequent to these warrant issuances resulting in an unrealized gain in the fair value of the
derivative liabilities. 

The gain on bargain purchase for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The lack of a gain for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was a result of the IMT acquisition in January 2016. The increase in the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is due to the Company finalizing the IMT purchase price allocation in the second quarter of 2016. 

Interest expense for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, compared to $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fluctuations were primarily due to the 35% prepayment penalty recorded
as interest on the conversion of the 8% Convertible Notes issued in June 2015 and July 2015 (the  8% Convertible Notes )
into the February 2016 financing; interest on the 5% Convertible Notes issued in January 2016 and the 8% Convertible Notes; and
interest on promissory notes issued to IMT and our CEO, George Schmitt. 

Net Loss  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $3.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million and
$10.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, or a decrease of $0 and an increase
of $1.2 million. 

The increase in net loss is due mainly
to an increase in amortization and depreciation, general and administrative and research and development expenses discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
a working capital of approximately $0.2 million including $1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. We have incurred net losses
of $11.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, we have incurred
negative operating cash flows including cash used in operations of $6.7 million and $5.1 million, for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Our future capital requirements may vary
materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent
of spending to support development efforts, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall
economic conditions. The Company does not currently have sufficient capital in order to fund operations for the next twelve months
from the balance sheet date or to achieve cash flow breakeven. Therefore, the Company is actively evaluating various alternatives
of financing in order to obtain additional capital to allow the Company to deliver its products. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Cash Flows   

The following table sets forth the major
components of our statements of cash flows data for the periods presented. 

For the Nine Month Period Ended  

  (In Thousands)  

Operating Activities  

Net cash used in operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $6.5 million as compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 representing an increase of $1.4 million. Of the $1.4 million increase, approximately $0.3 million was due to the acquisition
of IMT. 

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.04 million as compared to $1.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The net cash proceeds from the IMT acquisition were $(0.023) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No capitalization of intangible assets occurred
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Financing Activities  

Our net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8.0 million as compared to cash provided by financing activities
of $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were net
proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock in February and the issuance of common stock in May and July totaling $8.0
million; $1.0 million from short-term convertible notes; and $0.5 million from the exercise of warrants. In the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 there were net proceeds from the August 2015 financing totaling $4.7 million; net proceeds from the
conversion of the August 2015 financing Series B warrants totaling $0.1 million, net proceeds from the Series B and C
Preferred Stock totaling $1.5 million; and net proceeds from a short term convertible note totaling $1.5 million. 

Cost Reduction Initiatives   

In 2015, we implemented cost reduction
initiatives that included a decrease in our current full, part-time and contracted workforce. These initiatives resulted in a reduction
in monthly operating expenses to approximately $800,000   an improvement of over 30%. This saved the Company approximately
$3.5 million in 2015. 

On April 6, 2016, we announced the implementation
of further additional cost reduction initiatives that will include a decrease in our current, full, part-time and contracted workforce,
transitioning other employees to non-cash compensation agreements, and other reductions in operating expenses. These initiatives
are expected to result in a monthly decrease of $300,000 in our cash requirements or $2.7 million in 2016.     

Financing Events   

$500,000 Securities Purchase Agreement   

On January 29, 2016, we entered into a
securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 5% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the   5% Convertible
Notes  ) to accredited investors for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 for net proceeds of $500,000. In connection
with the February 2016 financing, all of our obligations under the 5% Convertible Notes have been extinguished. 

February 2016 Financing   

On February 29, 2016, we closed a public
offering of 296,389 Units, at a price of $12.00 per Unit, each of which consists of one share of our Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock and 0.5 of a Warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.52 per Warrant. We received approximately
$3,556,660 in gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company.
Roth Capital Partners acted as sole placement agent for the offering. The Company used $1,456,660 of the gross proceeds and repaid
the outstanding principal balance and interest on the 8% Convertible Notes and 5% Convertible Notes. 

April 2016 Financing   

On April 15, 2016, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the   Securities Purchase Agreement  ) with certain accredited investors
pursuant to which we sold a principal amount of $550,000 of 5% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes for an aggregate purchase
price of $500,000 (the   April 5% Convertible Notes  ). In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement,
we also entered into a security agreement, dated April 15, 2016, pursuant to which we granted the investors a security interest
in all of our assets. As of September 30, 2016, $215,000 principal was converted into 242,420 shares of common stock. 

May 2016 Financing   

On May 16, 2016,
we closed an offering of units in which the Company offered 1,166,667 Units, at a price of $0.84 per Unit, each of which consists
of one share of our common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an
exercise price of $1.3788 per share. We received approximately $980,000 in gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting placement
agent fees and offering expenses payable by us. Roth Capital Partners acted as sole placement agent for the offering. 

The Warrants will
be exercisable beginning on November 16, 2016 at an exercise price of $1.3788 per share. The Warrants will expire on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the initial date of issuance. 

July 2016 Financing   

On July 20, 2016, we completed an underwritten
public offering of 7,300,000 Units, each of which consists of one share of our common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and
1.25 of a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.685 per share. On July 15, 2016, the underwriters
exercised their over-allotment option to purchase warrants to purchase 1,368,750 shares of common stock. We received approximately
$4.3 million in net proceeds from the offering, including exercise of the over-allotment option, after deducting the underwriting
discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Roth Capital Partners acted as sole book-running manager for the offering.
Aegis Capital Corp. acted as co-lead manager for the offering. 

Our future capital requirements may vary
materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent
of spending to support development efforts, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products and overall
economic conditions. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital, obtain
other means of financing, and to fulfill purchase orders. Our ability to recognize revenue and ultimately cash receipts, on purchase
orders is contingent upon, but not limited to, acceptable performance of the delivered equipment and services. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not currently have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to our stockholders. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

In our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as a result of the lack of corporate accounting personnel
necessary to maintain adequate segregation of duties, insufficient resources to hire additional accounting personnel with the requisite
knowledge of U.S. GAAP, and not properly performing an effective risk assessment or monitoring of our internal controls over financial
reporting. As of September 30, 2016, we concluded that such weaknesses continued to exist. 

During 2016, the Company has made
progress to remedy these weaknesses through the recent hiring of an SEC reporting consultant to support the Director of
Finance and the acquisition of accounting personnel in the IMT acquisition in January 2016 who are able to assist in
supporting the Company s accounting department. The Company is continuing to further remediate these weaknesses
as its resources  permit it to. 

Changes in Internal Controls  

During the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting, except as discussed above. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.  

From time to time, we are a party to litigation
and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our
customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary
rights. 

As of September 30, 2016, we do not have
any litigation matters pending. 

Item 1A.     Risk Factors.  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.  

None 

Item 3.  Defaults Upon Senior
Securities.  

None. 

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.  

Not applicable. 

Item 5.  Other Information.  

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which
security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.
