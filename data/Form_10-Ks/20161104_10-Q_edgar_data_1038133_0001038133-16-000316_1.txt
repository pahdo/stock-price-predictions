1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Heska Corporation and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries ("Heska", the "Company", "we" or "our") sell advanced veterinary diagnostic and specialty products. Our state-of-the-art offerings include blood testing instruments and supplies, digital imaging products, software and services, vaccines, local and cloud-based data services, allergy testing and immunotherapy, and single-use offerings such as in-clinic diagnostic tests and heartworm preventive products. Our core focus is on supporting veterinarians in the canine and feline healthcare space. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company at   September 30, 2016  , the results of our operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and other financial information filed with the SEC. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are required when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for excess or obsolete inventory, in determining the period over which our obligations are fulfilled under agreements to license product rights and/or technology rights, evaluating long-lived and intangible assets for impairment, determining the allocation of purchase price under purchase accounting, estimating the expense associated with the granting of stock options, determining the value of our non-controlling interest and in determining the need for, and the amount of, a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    Our accounting policies are described in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards ASU, ("ASU") Topic 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". The update simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We

early adopted the standard during the second quarter of 2016 and are therefore required to report the impacts as though the standard had been adopted on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to earnings of   $0.2 million   (  $0.03   per diluted share) and   $0.8 million   (  $0.10   per diluted share) in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The update did not impact any periods prior to January 1, 2016, as we applied the changes to the standard on a prospective basis. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)", which supersedes ASC 840, Leases, and creates a new topic, ASC 842, Leases. This update requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This update will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". Upon the effective date, the ASU replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry specific guidance, in generally accepted accounting principles. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date".  The amendments in this update deferred the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year and are now effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim reporting periods within that period.  We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon implementation. 
   
  2.    ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED PARTY ITEMS 
  On May 31, 2016, the Company closed a transaction (the "Merger") to acquire Cuattro Veterinary, LLC ("Cuattro International") from Kevin S. Wilson, and all of the members of Cuattro International (the "Members").  Pursuant to the Merger, the Company issued   175,000   shares of the Company s common stock,   $.01   par value per share (the "Common Stock"), to the Members on the Closing Date, at an aggregate value equal to approximately   $6.3 million   based on the adjusted closing price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the Merger closing date. These shares were issued to the Members in a private placement in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and the safe harbor provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Effective on the Merger closing date, each of the Members executed lock-up agreements with the Company that restrict their ability to sell any of the shares of Common Stock received in the Merger until   180   days after the Merger closing date.  In addition, the Company assumed approximately   $1.5 million   in debt as part of the transaction. 
  Mr. Wilson is a founder of Cuattro International, Cuattro, LLC, Cuattro Software, LLC and Cuattro Medical, LLC. Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson and trusts for the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson s children and family own a   100%   interest in Cuattro, LLC and a majority interest in Cuattro Medical, LLC. Cuattro, LLC owns a   100%   interest in Cuattro Software, LLC and, prior to the Merger, owned a majority interest in Cuattro International. 
  The Company recorded assets acquired and assets assumed at their estimated fair values.  Intangible assets were valued based on a report from an independent third party.

Cuattro International is a provider to international markets of digital radiography technologies for veterinarians.  As a leading provider of advanced veterinary diagnostic and specialty products, we made the acquisition in an effort to combine Cuattro International's international reach with our domestic success in the imaging and blood testing markets in the United States.  International markets represent a significant portion of worldwide veterinary revenues for which we intend to compete.  
  As of the closing date of the Merger, Cuattro International was renamed Heska Imaging International, LLC, and the Company's interest in both Heska Imaging International, LLC ("International Imaging") and Heska Imaging US, LLC ("US Imaging") was transferred to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Heska Imaging Global, LLC ("Global Imaging").  
  On February 24, 2013, the Company acquired a   54.6%   interest in Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC (the "Acquisition"), which was subsequently renamed Heska Imaging US, LLC.  The remaining minority position   (45.4%)   in US Imaging is subject to purchase by Heska under performance-based puts and calls following calendar year 2016 and 2017. Should Heska undergo a change in control, as defined in the agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its minority position, prior to the end of 2017, US Imaging minority unit holders will be entitled to sell their US Imaging units to Heska. 
  US Imaging markets, sells and supports digital radiography and ultrasound products along with embedded software and support, data hosting and other services.

Shawna M. Wilson, Clint Roth, DVM, Steven M. Asakowicz, Rodney A. Lippincott, Kevin S. Wilson and Cuattro, LLC own approximately   29.75%  ,   8.39%  ,   4.09%  ,   3.07%  ,   0.05%   and   0.05%   of US Imaging, respectively. Kevin S. Wilson is the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and the spouse of Shawna M. Wilson. Steven M. Asakowicz serves as Executive Vice President, Companion Animal Health Sales for the Company. Rodney A. Lippincott serves as Executive Vice President, Companion Animal Health Sales for the Company.  
  Cuattro, LLC charged US Imaging   $3.6 million   from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016 and has charged Global Imaging   $3.6 million   since June 1, 2016, primarily related to digital imaging products, for which there is an underlying supply contract with minimum purchase obligations, software and services as well as other operating expenses; Heska Corporation has charged US Imaging   $3.7 million   during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to sales expenses; and Heska Corporation has charged Cuattro, LLC   $168 thousand   during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to facility usage and other services. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , US Imaging had a   $1.6 million   note receivable, including accrued interest, from International Imaging, which is due on June 15, 2019 and which eliminates in consolidation of the Company's financial statements.  This note was previously listed as "Note receivable   related party" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and, as discussed above, the note receivable was assumed as part of the Company's acquisition of Cuattro International.  At   September 30, 2016  , Heska Corporation had net accounts receivable from Cuattro, LLC of   $20 thousand   which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; International Imaging had a net receivable due from Cuattro, LLC of   $280 thousand  , which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; Global Imaging had net prepaid receivables from Cuattro, LLC of   $1.0 million   which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; Heska Corporation had accounts receivable from US Imaging of   $4.9 million  , including accrued interest, which eliminates in consolidation of the Company's financial statements; all monies owed accrue interest at the same interest rate Heska Corporation pays under its credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo") once past due with the exception of the note receivable, which accrues at this rate to its maturity date. 
  The aggregate position in US Imaging of the unit holders who hold the   45.4%   of US Imaging that Heska Corporation does not own (the "Put Value") is being accreted to its estimated redemption value in accordance with US Imaging's Operating Agreement (the "Operating Agreement"). Since the Operating Agreement contains certain put rights that are out of the control of the Company, authoritative guidance requires the non-controlling interest, which includes the estimated value of such put rights, to be displayed outside of the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The adjustment to increase or decrease the Put Value to its expected redemption value and to estimate any distributions required under the Operating Agreement to the unit holders who hold the   45.4%   of US Imaging that Heska Corporation does not own (the "Imaging Minority") each reporting period is recorded to stockholders' equity in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the non-controlling interest balance (in thousands):

3.    INCOME TAXES 
    
  Our total income tax expense and the effective tax rate for our income before income taxes are as follows (in thousands): 

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. The rates in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   benefited from additional tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards which are now recorded as income tax benefit or expense in earnings effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-09. We early adopted the ASU during the second quarter of 2016 and are therefore required to report the impacts as though the accounting standard update had been adopted on January 1, 2016. Accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to earnings of   $0.2 million   and   $0.8 million   in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Cash paid for income taxes for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and 2016 was   $8 thousand   and   $225 thousand  , respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and 2016 was   $28 thousand   and   $288 thousand  , respectively. 
   
  4.    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income attributable to Heska Corporation by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the numerator is increased to exclude charges that would not have been incurred, and the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the if-converted and treasury stock methods), if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (stock options and restricted stock units but excluding options to purchase fractional shares resulting from the Company's December 2010 1-for-  10   reverse stock split) had been converted to common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016   (in thousands, except per share data):

5.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 
    
  The following summarizes the changes in goodwill during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

6.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
    Detail of property and equipment is as follows (in thousands):   

  The Company has utilized marketing programs whereby its instruments in inventory may be placed in a customer's location on a rental basis. The cost of these instruments is transferred to machinery and equipment and depreciated, typically over a   five   to   seven   year period depending on the circumstance under which the instrument is placed with the customer. Total costs transferred from inventory were approximately   $3.4 million   and   $2.0 million   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively. 
  The Company has sold certain customer rental contracts and underlying assets to third parties under agreements that once the customer has met its obligations under the contract, ownership of the assets underlying the contract would be returned to the Company. The Company enters a debit to cash and a corresponding credit to deferred revenue at the time of these sales. These sales, all related to the Company's   54.6%  -owned subsidiary, US Imaging, provided   $59 thousand   of cash which was reported in the "deferred revenue and other" line item of the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . There were no such sales during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As the Company anticipates it will regain ownership of the assets underlying these sales, it reports these assets as part of property and equipment and depreciates these assets in accordance with its depreciation policies. The Company had   $2.2 million   and   $1.1 million   of net property and equipment related to these transactions as of December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, all related to the Company's   54.6%  -owned subsidiary, US Imaging. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was   $1.2 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   $1.2 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  .

HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     - (Continued) 

Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was   $3.2 million   and   $3.4 million   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively. 
  The Company capitalizes third-party software costs, where appropriate, and reports such costs, net of accumulated amortization, on the "property and equipment, net" line of its consolidated balance sheets. We had   $0.4 million   of such capitalized costs, net of accumulated amortization, on the "property and equipment, net" line in each of our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2016  . Capitalized software costs in a given year are reported on the "purchases of property and equipment" line item of the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. We had   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   of capitalized software costs reported on the "purchases of property and equipment" line item of our consolidated statements of cash flows for   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively.  
   
  7.    INVENTORIES    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory we manufacture includes the cost of material, labor and overhead. If the cost of inventories exceeds estimated net realizable value, provisions are made to reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value. 
  Inventories, net consist of the following (in thousands): 

8.    ACCRUED LIABILITIES 
  Accrued liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Other accrued liabilities consists of items that are individually less than 5% of total current liabilities.

  The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option- pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for options granted in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30,     2015   and   2016  . 

A summary of our stock option plans, excluding options to purchase fractional shares resulting from our December 2010 1-for-  10   reverse stock split, is as follows: 

The total estimated fair value of stock options granted during   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   were computed to be approximately   $51 thousand   and   $9 thousand  , respectively.  The total estimated fair value of stock options granted during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and 2016 were computed to be approximately   $309 thousand   and   $277 thousand  , respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options. The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016   was computed to be approximately   $9.00   and   $13.96  , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016   was   $3.1 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively. The cash proceeds from options exercised during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016   was   $1.4 million   and   $740 thousand  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at   September 30, 2016  , excluding outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of   3.5   fractional shares resulting from our December 2010 1-for-  10   reverse stock split with a weighted average remaining contractual life of   0.2   years, a weighted average exercise price of   $17.93   and exercise prices ranging from   $17.17   -   $22.50  . We intend to issue whole shares only from option exercises.

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $1.8 million   in total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.40   years, with approximately   $242 thousand   to be recognized in the three months ending   December 31, 2016   and all cost to be recognized as of September 2020, assuming all options vest according to the vesting schedules in place at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options was approximately   $33.7 million   and the aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options was approximately   $27.1 million  . 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30,     2015   and   2016  , we issued   11,475   and   13,965   shares under the ESPP, respectively. 
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , we estimated the fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used for the periods presented were as follows: 

For   the nine months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , the weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted was   $5.77   and   $7.64   per share, respectively. For   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , the weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted was   $5.89   and   $9.87   per share, respectively.

  Restrictions on the transfer of Company stock 
  The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), places restrictions (the "Transfer Restrictions") on the transfer of the Company's stock that could adversely affect the Company's ability to utilize its domestic Federal Net Operating Loss Position. In particular, the Transfer Restrictions prevent the transfer of shares without the approval of the Company's Board of Directors if, as a consequence of such transfer, an individual, entity or groups of individuals or entities would become a 5-percent holder under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the related Treasury regulations, and also prevents any existing   5  -percent holder from increasing his or her ownership position in the Company without the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. Any transfer of shares in violation of the Transfer Restrictions (a "Transfer Violation") shall be void   ab initio   under the Certificate of Incorporation, and the Company's Board of Directors has procedures under the Certificate of Incorporation to remedy a Transfer Violation including requiring the shares causing such Transfer Violation to be sold and any profit resulting from such sale to be transferred to a charitable entity chosen by the Company's Board of Directors in specified circumstances.

11.        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company holds certain rights to market and manufacture all products developed or created under certain research, development and licensing agreements with various entities. In connection with such agreements, the Company has agreed to pay the entities royalties on net product sales. In each of   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   2016  , royalties of   $0.1 million   became payable under these agreements. In each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, royalties of   $0.3 million   became payable under these agreements.  
  The Company has contracts with suppliers for unconditional annual minimum inventory purchases and milestone obligations to third parties the Company believes are likely to be triggered currently totaling approximately   $0.2 million   for each of the fiscal years   2016   and   2017  . 
  From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations. On March 12, 2015, a complaint was filed against us by Shaun Fauley in the United States District Court Northern District of Illinois alleging our transmittal of unauthorized faxes in violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, as a class action seeking stated damages of the greater of actual monetary loss or five hundred dollars per violation. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. As of   September 30,   2016, the Company was not a party to any other legal proceedings that were expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
  The Company's current terms and conditions of sale include a limited warranty that its products and services will conform to published specifications at the time of shipment and a more extensive warranty related to certain of its products. The Company also sells a renewal warranty for certain of its products. The typical remedy for breach of warranty is to correct or replace any defective product, and if not possible or practical, the Company will accept the return of the defective product and refund the amount paid. Historically, the Company has incurred minimal warranty costs. The Company's warranty reserve was   $0.4 million   at both   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  12.    INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME)

13.    CREDIT FACILITY 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $15.0 million   asset-based revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo which has a maturity date of   December 31, 2017   as part of our credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.6 million   borrowings outstanding on this line of credit. Our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash, eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. Any interest on borrowings due is to be charged at a stated rate of three month LIBOR plus   2.25%   and payable monthly.  There is an annual minimum interest charge of   $75 thousand   under the agreement. We are required to comply with various financial and non-financial covenants, and we have made various representations and warranties under our agreement with Wells Fargo. A key financial covenant is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in our agreement with Wells Fargo. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and our available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately   $11.1 million  . 
   
  14.    SEGMENT REPORTING 
  The Company consists of   two   reportable segments, Core Companion Animal Health ("CCA") and Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals and Products ("OVP"). The CCA segment includes diagnostic instruments and supplies, as well as single use diagnostic and other tests, pharmaceuticals and vaccines, primarily for canine and feline use. The CCA segment also includes digital radiography and ultrasound products along with embedded software and support, data hosting and other services from Heska Imaging. These products are sold directly by the Company as well as through independent third-party distributors and through other distribution relationships. CCA segment products manufactured at the Des Moines, Iowa production facility included in the OVP segment's assets are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for the OVP segment. The OPV segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production, primarily for cattle, but also for other animals including small mammals. All OVP products are sold by third parties under third-party labels.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Part I Item I of this Form 10-Q.  
  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements, which include statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration, gross profit margins, selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, capital resources, additional financings or borrowings and additional losses, are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors," that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The forward-looking statements set forth in this Form 10-Q are as of the close of business on November 3, 2016 and we undertake no duty and do not intend to update this information, except as required by applicable laws. 
   
  Overview 
  We sell advanced veterinary diagnostic and specialty products.  Our state-of-the-art offerings include blood testing instruments and supplies, digital imaging products, software and services, vaccines, local and cloud-based data services, allergy testing and immunotherapy, and single-use offerings such as in-clinic diagnostic tests and heartworm preventive products. Our core focus is on supporting veterinarians in the canine and feline healthcare space. 
   Our business consists of two reportable segments, Core Companion Animal Health ("CCA"), which represented 81% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 (which we define as "LTM") and Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals and Products ("OVP"), which represented 19% of LTM revenue.  
  The CCA segment includes, primarily for canine and feline use, blood testing instruments and supplies, digital imaging products, software and services, local and cloud-based data services, allergy testing and immunotherapy, and single use offerings such as in-clinic diagnostic tests and heartworm preventive products. 
  Blood testing and other non-imaging instruments and supplies represented approximately 38% of our LTM revenue. Many products in this area involve placing an instrument in the field and generating future revenue from consumables, including items such as supplies and service, as that instrument is used. Approximately 29% of our LTM revenue resulted from the sale of such consumables to an installed base of instruments and approximately 9% of our LTM revenue was from hardware revenue. A loss of, or disruption in, the supply of consumables we are selling to an installed base of instruments could substantially harm our business. All of our blood testing and other non-imaging instruments and supplies are supplied by third parties, who typically own the product rights and supply the product to us under marketing and/or distribution

agreements. In many cases, we have collaborated with a third party to adapt a human instrument for veterinary use. Major products in this area include our instruments for chemistry, hematology, blood gas, and immunodiagnostic testing and their affiliated operating consumables. Revenue from products in these three areas, including revenues from consumables, represented approximately 34% of our LTM revenue. 
  Imaging hardware, software and services represented approximately 20% of LTM revenue. Digital radiography is the largest product offering in this area, which also includes ultrasound instruments. Digital radiography solutions typically consist of a combination of hardware and software placed with a customer, often combined with an ongoing service and support contract. With our acquisition of Cuattro Veterinary, LLC, subsequently renamed Heska Imaging International, LLC, we now sell our imaging solutions both in the United States and internationally. Our experience has been that most of the revenue is generated at the time of sale in this area, in contrast to the blood testing category discussed above where ongoing consumable revenue is often a larger component of economic value as a given blood testing instrument is used. 
  Other CCA revenue, including single use diagnostic and other tests, pharmaceuticals and biologicals as well as research and development, licensing and royalty revenue, represented approximately 24% of our LTM revenue. Since items in this area are often single use by their nature, our typical aim is to build customer satisfaction and loyalty for each product, generate repeat annual sales from existing customers and expand our customer base in the future. Products in this area are both supplied by third parties and provided by us. Major products and services in this area include heartworm diagnostic tests and preventives, and allergy test kits, allergy immunotherapy and testing. Combined revenue from heartworm-related products and allergy-related products represented 22% of our LTM revenue. 
  We consider the CCA segment to be our core business and devote most of our management time and other resources to improving the prospects for this segment. Maintaining a continuing, reliable and economic supply of products we currently obtain from third parties is critical to our success in this area. Virtually all of our sales and marketing expenses occur in the CCA segment. The majority of our research and development spending is dedicated to this segment as well. 
  All of our CCA products are ultimately sold primarily to or through veterinarians. In many cases, veterinarians will mark up their costs to their customer. The acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success. CCA products are sold directly to end users by us as well as through distribution relationships, such as our agreement with Intervet Inc., d/b/a Merck Animal Health ("Merck Animal Health"), the sale of kits to conduct blood testing to third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third-party distributors. Revenue from direct sales and distribution relationships represented approximately 61% and 39%, respectively, of CCA LTM revenue. 
  The OVP segment includes our 168,000 square foot USDA- and FDA-licensed production facility in Des Moines, Iowa. We view this facility as an asset which could allow us to control our cost of goods on any pharmaceuticals and vaccines that we may commercialize in the future. We have increased integration of this facility with our operations elsewhere. For example, virtually all our U.S. inventory, excluding our imaging products, is now stored at this facility and related fulfillment logistics are managed there. CCA segment products manufactured at this facility are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for our OVP segment. We view OVP reported revenue as revenue primarily to cover the overhead costs of the facility and to generate incremental cash flow to fund our CCA segment. 
  Our OVP segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production, primarily for cattle but also for other animals such as small mammals. All OVP products are sold by third parties under third-party labels. 
  
   -21 

Historically, a significant portion of our OVP segment's revenue has been generated from the sale of certain bovine vaccines, which have been sold primarily under the Titanium  and MasterGuard  brands. We have an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company ("Eli Lilly") and its affiliates operating through Elanco for the production of these vaccines. Our OVP segment also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of sales represented by certain items reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

-22 

Revenue 
  Total revenue increased   19%   to   $33.4 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $28.0 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   increased     21%   to   $90.5 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $74.8 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  CCA segment revenue   increased     26%   to   $26.4 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $21.0 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  CCA segment revenue   increased     21%   to   74.3 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $61.3 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Greater revenue from digital radiography products, instruments and consumables and heartworm preventive products were key factors in the increase in both periods presented. 
  OVP segment revenue   decreased   slightly to   $7.0 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.1 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   increased     20%   to   $16.3 million     the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $13.5 million     in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Revenue from sales under our agreement with Elanco was a key factor in both periods presented.  
  Gross Profit 
  Gross profit   increased     18%   to   $13.7 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $11.6 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Gross Margin, which is gross profit divided by total revenue,   decreased   to   41.0%   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   41.4%   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Unfavorable product mix related to the sale of digital radiography products was the key factor in the Gross Margin decrease. Gross profit   increased     18%   to   $37.8 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $32.0 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Gross Margin   decreased   to   41.8%   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   42.7%   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Unfavorable product mix in our OVP segment was the key factor in the Gross Margin decline in the year to date period.  
  Operating Expenses 
  Selling and marketing expenses   increased     6%   to   $5.5 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.2 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and   increased     4%   to   $16.5 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $15.9 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Increased commissions due to higher revenue from our instruments and consumables and digital imaging products were key factors in the change in both periods presented.  
  Research and development expenses   increased   slightly by   3%   to $  507 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $493 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Research and development expenses   increased     23%   to   $1.6 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.3 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Increased development project spending related to single use diagnostic products was a factor in the change.  
  General and administrative expenses   decreased     15%   to   $3.2 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.8 million   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The key factor for the decrease was a $0.9 million charge that was incurred in the third quarter of 2015 for certain accelerated payments and stock vesting related to the early-termination of our Executive Chair's employment agreement. 
  
   -  -23  - 

General and administrative expenses   decreased     1%   to   $9.7 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.8 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Key factors in the decrease included the early-termination charges noted above, offset by an increase in intangible amortization related to our acquisition of Cuattro International. 
  Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net 
  Interest and other expense (income), net, was expense of   $14 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to income of   $69 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Interest and other expense (income), net, was income of   $85 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to an expense of   $105 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This line item can be broken into the following components: net interest income or expense, net foreign currency gains and losses and other income. Net interest was income of   $24 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to an expense of   $15 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest was an expense of   $37 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to an expense of   $19 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net foreign currency loss was   $10 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net foreign currency gain of   $84 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015  . A key factor in the difference was the impact of exchange rates between the Euro and the Swiss Franc, which is the functional currency of our Swiss subsidiary. Net foreign currency gain was   $30 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net foreign currency loss of   $86 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Other income was   $92 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily related to the sale of an equity investment during the first quarter of 2016.  
  Income Tax Expense 
   In   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , we had total income tax expense of   $1.1 million  , including   $1.0 million   in domestic deferred income tax expense, a non-cash item primarily related to our domestic federal net operating loss carryforward ("NOL") position, and   $123 thousand   in current income tax expense.  In   the three months ended September 30, 2015  , we had total income tax expense of   0.8 million  , including   $0.7 million   in domestic deferred income tax expense, a non-cash item primarily related to our domestic NOL position, and   $0.1 million   in current income tax expense. Greater income before income taxes was the key factor. In   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had total income tax expense of   $2.6 million  , including   $2.3 million   in domestic deferred income tax expense, a non-cash item primarily related to our domestic NOL position, and   $0.3 million   in current income tax expense. In   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we had total income tax expense of   $1.7 million  , including   $1.5 million   in domestic deferred income tax expense, a non-cash item primarily related to our domestic NOL position, and   $0.2 million   in current income tax expense. Greater income before income taxes was a key factor in our higher income tax expense in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  The impact of greater income before income taxes was somewhat offset by additional tax benefits of $0.2 million and $0.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, related to employee share-based payment awards which are now recorded as income tax benefit or expense in earnings effective with ASU 2016-09, which we adopted in the second quarter of 2016.

Net Income attributable to Heska Corporation 
  Net income attributable to Heska Corporation was   $3.3 million   for   the three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net income attributable to Heska Corporation of   $1.4 million   in the prior year period. Net income attributable to Heska Corporation was   $7.1 million   for   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to a net income attributable to Heska Corporation of   $3.2 million   in the prior year period. The difference between this line item and "Net Income" is the net income or loss attributable to our minority interest in US Imaging, which was a net loss of   $4 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a loss of   $32 thousand   in   the three months ended September 30, 2015   and net income of   $477 thousand   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a loss of   $66 thousand     in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Impact of Inflation 
    In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. 
   
  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition 
  We believe that adequate liquidity and cash generation is important to the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.  Our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash, cash generated from current operations and availability under our credit facilities noted below. 
    
  For   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had net income of   $7.5 million   and net cash provided by operations of   $1.9 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $9.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of   $30.6 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a $  15.0 million   asset-based revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo which has a maturity date of   December 31, 2017   as part of our credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.6 million   borrowings outstanding on this line of credit. Our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash, eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. Any interest on borrowings due is to be charged at a stated rate of three month LIBOR plus 2.25% and payable monthly.  There is an annual minimum interest charge of $75 thousand under the agreement. We are required to comply with various financial and non-financial covenants, and we have made various representations and warranties under our agreement with Wells Fargo. A key financial covenant is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in our agreement with Wells Fargo. Failure to comply with any of the covenants, representations or warranties could result in our being in default on the loan and could cause all outstanding amounts payable to Wells Fargo to become immediately due and payable or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and our available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately $  11.1 million  .

A summary of our cash from operating, investing and financing activities is as follows (in thousands): 

Net cash provided by operating activities was   $1.9 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to net cash used by operating activities of   $0.9 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a favorable   increase   of approximately   $2.8 million  . Key factors in the change were a $5.2 million increase in net income and deferred tax expense, a $2.8 million decrease in cash used for inventory, and a $2.8 million increase in cash provided by accounts receivable and other current assets, partially offset by a $4.9 million increase in cash used for accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other short term liabilities and a $3.3 million increase in cash used in deferred revenue and other non-current assets. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $1.3 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $2.0 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a favorable   decrease   of approximately   $0.7 million  . Proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and the sale of an equity investment were factors in the change.  
  Net cash flows from financing activities provided cash of   $1.7 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $3.0 million   in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which represented a   $1.3 million     decrease   in cash provided by financing activities.  The largest factor in the change was a decrease in cash provided from the issuance of common stock, net of distributions. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , US Imaging had a   $1.6 million   note receivable, including accrued interest, from International Imaging, which is due on June 15, 2019 and which eliminates in consolidation of the Company's financial statements.  This note was previously listed as "Note receivable   related party" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and the note receivable was assumed as part of the Company's acquisition of Cuattro International.  At   September 30, 2016  , Heska Corporation had net accounts receivable from Cuattro, LLC of   $20 thousand   which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; International Imaging had a net receivable due from Cuattro, LLC of   $280 thousand  , which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; Global Imaging had net prepaid receivables from Cuattro, LLC of   $1.0 million   which is included in "Due from   related parties" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets; Heska Corporation had accounts receivable from US Imaging of   $4.9 million  , including accrued interest, which eliminates in consolidation of the Company's financial statements; all monies owed accrue interest at the same interest rate Heska Corporation pays under its credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo Bank once past due with the exception of the note receivable, which accrues at this rate to its maturity date.

At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.4 million   of borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet related to the borrowings of International Imaging. This debt bears an interest rate of 5.75% per annum and is due in equal monthly payments, including principal and interest, through June 27, 2018. At   September 30, 2016  , we had other borrowings outstanding totaling   $116 thousand  , all of which were obligations of a US Imaging loan from De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. ("DLL"). The note bears an interest rate of 6% per annum and is due in equal monthly payments, including principal and interest, of $13 thousand through June 2017. The note may be prepaid prior to maturity, but is subject to a surcharge in such a circumstance. Principal associated with these borrowings of approximately   $375 thousand   is listed as "Other short term borrowings" on our consolidated balance sheets as it is due within a year. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated balance sheets included   $15.6 million   in non-controlling interest. This represents the value of the aggregate position in US Imaging of the Imaging Minority. At the time of the Acquisition, we estimated a weighted average valuation for this position and began accreting to this value over a three year period from the date of the Acquisition using a weighted average cost of capital of 18.65%. The cost of capital assumption was provided to us by a third party with expertise in estimating such items. We evaluate the value of this position every reporting period and in 2014 decided to adjust our accretion to a weighted average accretion based on various potential outcomes and our estimate of the likelihood of such outcomes, which had the effect of lowering the accretion from what it otherwise would have been. The accretion is to be recorded as a credit where this line item has increased compared to the prior reporting period, with the corresponding debit to directly reduce additional paid-in-capital as we have an accumulated deficit. If the value of non-controlling interest were to decrease compared to the prior reporting period, we anticipate non-controlling interest would be adjusted with a debit to non-controlling interest and a corresponding credit to additional paid-in-capital. 
  Our financial plan for 2016 indicates that our available cash and cash equivalents, together with cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our operations through 2016 and into 2017. However, our actual results may differ from this plan, and we may be required to consider alternative strategies. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future. If necessary, we expect to raise these additional funds through the issuance of new term debt secured by the same assets as the term loans which were fully repaid in 2010, the sale of equity securities or the increased sale of customer leases. There is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on acceptable terms, if at all, and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of some of the factors that affect our capital raising alternatives. 
  Under the Operating Agreement, should US Imaging meet certain performance criteria, the Imaging Minority, which has been granted put options, may sell us some or all of the Imaging Minority's remaining 45.4% position in US Imaging following the audit of our 2016 and 2017 financial statements. US Imaging generated   $15.5 million   in revenue,   $6.3 million   in gross profit and   $1.1 million   in operating income in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $12.9 million   in revenue,   $4.8 million   in gross profit and   $16 thousand   in operating loss in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . If US Imaging generates at least $20 million in revenue in either 2016 or 2017 and the Imaging Minority exercises its put right in full, we would be required to purchase the Imaging Minority's position for consideration valued at 9 times US Imaging's operating income, subject to a maximum valuation of $13.6 million   as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash.  If US Imaging generates at least $30 million in revenue and $3.0 million in operating income in either 2016 or 2017 and the Imaging Minority exercises its put right in full, we would be required to purchase the Imaging Minority's position for consideration valued at $17.0 million   as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash.  Furthermore, should US Imaging meet certain performance criteria, and the Imaging Minority fail to exercise an applicable put to sell us all of the Imaging Minority's position in US Imaging following the audit of our 2016 or 2017 financial statements, we would have a call option to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Imaging Minority's position in US Imaging.  If US Imaging generates at least $30 million in revenue and $3.0  
  
   -27 

million in operating income in either 2016 or 2017 and the Imaging Minority does not exercise its put rights at all, we would have the option to purchase the Imaging Minority's position for consideration valued at $19.6 million   as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash. We believe it is likely that we will have the contractual right to deliver up to 55% of the consideration for these puts and calls in shares of our Public Common Stock. While we intend to meet any related cash payment obligations with funds provided by our ongoing operations and assets, likely supplemented by debt financing and potentially with equity financing, there can be no assurance our results will unfold according to our expectations. These potential cash payment obligations are an important consideration for us in our cash management decisions. 
  We believe it is likely that US Imaging will meet the required performance criteria for the 2016 lowest strike put, but not the 2016 highest strike put, following the audit of our 2016 financial statements and that we will be able to deliver 55% of the consideration required by the put in our Public Common Stock. In this case, the Imaging Minority would be granted a put following our 2016 audit which could require us to deliver up to $13.6 million as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash, to purchase the 45.4% of US Imaging we do not own. In such a case, while we have the right to deliver up to 55% of the consideration in our Public Common Stock under certain conditions, such stock is to be valued based on 90% of market value (the "Delivery Stock Value") and is limited to approximately 650 thousand shares in any case. If the Delivery Stock Value per share is less than the market value per share of our Public Common Stock at the time of the Acquisition, we will not have the right to deliver any Public Common Stock as consideration. Assuming we deliver the full 55% of the consideration in our Public Common Stock, we could still have an obligation to pay as much as approximately $6.1 million in cash as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash to the Imaging Minority in this circumstance. We believe it is also possible that US Imaging will meet the required performance criteria for the 2016 highest strike put, in which case our cash obligation would be increased as compared to the 2016 lowest strike put as outlined above. 
  We would consider acquisitions if we felt they were consistent with our strategic direction. We paid $1.6 million in dividends in 2012, and while we may consider paying dividends again in the long term, we do not anticipate the payment of any further dividends for the foreseeable future. We conducted an odd lot tender offer in 2012 which could have led to the repurchase of approximately $400 thousand of our stock if all eligible holders had chosen to participate, and while we may consider stock repurchase alternatives in an opportunistic manner or in the long term, we do not anticipate any stock repurchase programs in the foreseeable future. 
    
  Effect of currency translation on cash 
  Net effect of foreign currency translations on cash changed   $42 thousand   to a $  39 thousand   positive impact in   the nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a $  3 thousand   negative impact in   the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  These effects are related to changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and the Swiss Franc, which is the functional currency of our Swiss subsidiary. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of these unaudited Condensed  
  
   -28 

Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates, discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, include estimates for revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, accounting for income taxes, the value of our non-controlling interest and assessing excess and obsolete inventories. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
  Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in United States and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the United States dollar. These exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $1.6 million   outstanding borrowings on our line of credit with Wells Fargo. We had approximately   $9.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  , the majority of which was invested in liquid interest bearing accounts. We had no interest rate hedge transactions in place on   September 30, 2016  . We completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis based on the above and an assumed one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would have an approximate $77 thousand negative impact on our pre-tax earnings based on our outstanding balances as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  Our investment in foreign assets consists primarily of our investment in our Swiss subsidiary. Foreign currency risk may impact our results of operations. In cases where we purchase inventory in one currency and sell corresponding products in another, our gross margin percentage is typically at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, in cases where we may be generating operating income in foreign currencies, the magnitude of such operating income when translated into U.S. dollars will be at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates. Our agreements with suppliers and customers vary significantly in regard to the existence and extent of currency adjustment and other currency risk sharing provisions. We had no foreign currency hedge transactions in place on   September 30, 2016  . 
  We have a wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland which uses the Swiss Franc as its functional currency. We purchase inventory in foreign currencies, primarily Euros, and sell corresponding products in U.S. dollars. We also sell products in foreign currencies, primarily Euros and Japanese Yen, where our inventory costs are largely in U.S. dollars. Based on our results of operations for the twelve months ending   September 30, 2016  , currency holdings and currency-related prepaid accounts, accounts receivable and accounts payable (all of which, including currency holdings, we will refer to as "Currency Accounts") as of   September 30, 2016   and the functional currency of the accounting entity where such Currency Accounts are held, the expected impact on our consolidated statements of operations, if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen/weaken by 25% against the U.S. dollar, would be a resulting gain/loss in operating income of approximately   $52 thousand   and a currency loss/gain of   $344 thousand  , if all other currencies were to strengthen/weaken by 25% against the Swiss Franc, would be a resulting loss/gain in operating income of approximately   $147 thousand   and a currency gain/loss of   $424 thousand  , and if all other currencies were to strengthen/weaken by 25% against the Euro, would be a resulting loss/gain in operating income of approximately   $293 thousand   and a currency loss/gain of   $760 thousand  .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
  From time to time, we may be involved in litigation related to claims arising out of our operations. On March 12, 2015, a complaint was filed against us by Shaun Fauley in the United States District Court Northern District of Illinois alleging our transmittal of unauthorized faxes in violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, as a class action seeking stated damages of the greater of actual monetary loss or five hundred dollars per violation. We intend to defend the Company vigorously in this matter. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not a party to any other legal proceedings that are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Information regarding reportable legal proceedings is contained in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
           Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem to be currently immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the price of our Public Common Stock could decline and investors in our Public Common Stock could experience losses on their investment. 
    
  Our February 2013 acquisition of a 54.6% majority interest in Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC, which has been renamed Heska Imaging US, LLC, could be detrimental to the interests of our shareholders due to related puts, calls or other provisions, or for other reasons including related to conflicts of interest, as could our May 2016 acquisition of Cuattro Veterinary, LLC, which has been renamed Heska Imaging International, LLC, or other acquisitions. 
    
  Under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Heska Imaging (the "Operating Agreement"), should Heska Imaging ("US Imaging") meet certain performance criteria, the Imaging Minority  
  
   -  -30  - 

has been granted a put option to sell us some or all of the Imaging Minority's position in US Imaging following the audit of our financial statements for 2016 and 2017.  Based on US Imaging's current ownership position, this put option could require us to deliver up to $17.0 million following calendar year 2016 or calendar year 2017 - as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash (any applicable payment in aggregate to be defined as the "Put Payment") to acquire the outstanding minority interest in US Imaging.  While we have the right to deliver up to 55% of the consideration in our Public Common Stock under certain circumstances, such stock is to be valued based on 90% of market value (the "Delivery Stock Value") and is limited to approximately 650 thousand shares in any case.  If the Delivery Stock Value per share is less than the market value per share of our Public Common Stock at the time of the Acquisition, we do not have the right to deliver any Public Common Stock as consideration.  Cash required under any Put Payment could put a significant strain on our financial position or require us to raise additional capital.  There is no guarantee that additional capital will be available in such a circumstance on reasonable terms, if at all.  We may be unable to obtain debt financing, the public markets may be unreceptive to equity financing and we may not be able to obtain financing from other alternative sources, such as private equity.  Any debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and high interest rates and any equity financing would likely be dilutive to stockholders in this scenario.  If additional funds are required and are not available, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our ability to continue as a going concern. 
    
  Under the Operating Agreement, should US Imaging meet certain performance criteria, and the Imaging Minority fail to exercise an applicable put to sell us all of the Imaging Minority's position in US Imaging following the audit of our financial statements for 2016 and 2017, we would have a call option to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Imaging Minority's position in US Imaging.  Based on US Imaging's current ownership position, exercising this call option could require us to deliver up to $19.6 million following calendar year 2016 or calendar year 2017 - as well as 25% of US Imaging's cash (any applicable payment in aggregate to be defined as the "Call Payment") to acquire the outstanding minority interest in US Imaging.  While we have the right to deliver up to 55% of the consideration in our Public Common Stock under certain circumstances, such stock is to be valued based on 90% of market value (the "Delivery Stock Value") and is limited to approximately 650 thousand shares in any case.  If the Delivery Stock Value per share is less than the market value per share of our Public Common Stock at the time of the Acquisition, we do not have the right to deliver any Public Common Stock as consideration.  If we believe it is desirable to exercise any one of these calls, cash required under the Call Payment could put a significant strain on our financial position or require us to raise additional capital.  There is no guarantee that additional capital will be available in such a circumstance on reasonable terms, if at all.  If we believe it is desirable to exercise any such call, determine we are unable to economically finance the Call Payment and do not exercise the call as a result, we could be subject to a more expensive Put Payment less than a year in the future.  In this circumstance, unless there is a significant change in our financial position or market conditions, such a Put Payment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our ability to continue as a going concern. 
    
  Under and as defined in and subject to the terms of the Operating Agreement, should we undergo a change in control, the Imaging Minority will be entitled to sell their US Imaging units to us for cash of up to $13.6 million based on US Imaging's prior year Operating Income (the "Change in Control Payment").  The Change in Control Payment may decrease the interest of third parties in acquiring the Company or a majority of the Company's shares, which could otherwise have occurred at a premium to the Company's then current market price for the benefit of some or all of our shareholders.  This could make some investors less likely to buy and hold our stock. 
    
  Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, US Imaging is to be managed by a three-person board of managers, two of which are to be appointed by Heska Corporation and one of which is to be appointed by Kevin     S. Wilson, a founder of Heska Imaging who has also been Heska Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and President since March 31, 2014.  The current board of managers consists of Mr. Wilson, Jason A.  
  
   -31 

Napolitano, Heska Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, Chief Strategist and Secretary and Nancy Wisnewski, Ph.D., Heska Corporation's Executive Vice President, Diagnostic Operations   Product Development.  Until the earlier of (1) our acquiring 100% of the units of US Imaging pursuant to the puts and/or calls discussed above or (2) the sixth anniversary of the Acquisition, US Imaging may only take the following actions, among others, by unanimous consent of the board of managers: (i) issue securities, (ii) incur, guarantee, prepay, refinance, renew, modify or extend debt, (iii) enter into material contracts, (iv) hire or terminate an officer or amend the terms of their employment, (v) make a distribution other than a tax or liquidation distribution, (vi) enter into a material acquisition or disposition arrangement or a merger, (vii) lease or acquire an interest in real property, (viii) convert or reorganize US Imaging, or (ix) amend its certificate of formation or the Heska Imaging Agreement.  This unanimous consent provision may hinder our ability to optimize the value of our investment in US Imaging in certain circumstances. 
    
  While the terms of both the Amended and Restated Master License Agreement and the Supply Agreement between US Imaging and Cuattro, LLC were negotiated at arm's length as part of the Acquisition, Mr. Wilson has an interest in these agreements and any time and resources devoted to monitoring and overseeing this relationship may prevent us from deploying such time and resources on more productive matters. 
    
  Mr. Wilson's employment agreement with us acknowledges that Mr. Wilson has business interests in Cuattro, LLC, Cuattro Software, LLC and Cuattro Medical, LLC which may require a portion of his time, resources and attention in his working hours.  If Mr. Wilson is distracted by these or other business interests, he may not contribute as much as he otherwise would have to enhancing our business, to the detriment of our shareholder value.  Mr. Wilson is the spouse of Shawna M. Wilson ("Mrs. Wilson").  Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson and trusts for their children and family own a majority interest in Cuattro Medical, LLC.  In addition, including shares held by Mrs. Wilson and by trusts for the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson's children and family, Mr. Wilson also owns a 100% interest in Cuattro, LLC, the largest supplier to Global Imaging.  Cuattro, LLC owns a 100% interest in Cuattro Software, LLC.  
    
  Cuattro, LLC has charged US Imaging $3.6 million from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016 and has charged Global Imaging $3.6 million from June 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, primarily related to digital imaging products, for which there is an underlying supply contract with minimum purchase obligations, software and services as well as other operating expenses; Heska Corporation has charged US Imaging $3.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to sales and other administrative expenses; and Heska Corporation has charged Cuattro, LLC $168 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily related to facility usage and other services. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , US Imaging had a   $1.6 million   note receivable, including accrued interest, from International Imaging, which is due on June 15, 2019 and which eliminates in consolidation of the Company's financial statements.  This note was previously listed as "Note receivable   related party" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and the note receivable was assumed as part of the Company's acquisition of Cuattro International. At September 30, 2016 Heska Corporation had accounts receivable from US Imaging of   $4.9 million  , including accrued interest; Heska Corporation had net accounts receivable from Cuattro, LLC of   $20 thousand  ; Global Imaging had net prepaid receivables from Cuattro, LLC of $  1.0 million  ; and International Imaging had a net receivable due from Cuattro, LLC of   $280 thousand  .  All monies owed accrue interest at the same interest rate Heska Corporation pays under its credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo once past due with the exception of the note receivable, which accrues at this rate to its maturity date. 
    
  Mrs. Wilson, Clint Roth, DVM, Mr. Asakowicz, Mr. Lippincott, Mr. Wilson and Cuattro, LLC own approximately 29.75%, 8.39%, 4.09%, 3.07%, 0.05% and 0.05% of US Imaging, respectively, each are a member of US Imaging, and each have an interest in the puts and calls discussed above.  If Mr. Wilson,  
  
   -32 

Mr. Asakowicz or Mr. Lippincott is distracted by these holdings or interests, they may not contribute as much as they otherwise would have to enhancing our business, to the detriment of our shareholder value.  While the Operating Agreement was negotiated at arm's length as part of the Acquisition, and requires that none of the members shall cause US Imaging to operate its business in any manner other than the ordinary course of business, any time and resources devoted to monitoring and overseeing this relationship may prevent us from deploying such time and resources on more productive matters. 
    
  In addition, like any acquisition, if US Imaging significantly underperforms relative to our financial expectations, it may serve to diminish rather than enhance shareholder value.  Heska US generated operating income of $0.8 million in 2015 and an operating loss of approximately $2.1 million in 2014.  
    
  On May 31, 2016, we acquired Cuattro Veterinary, LLC, which we subsequently renamed Heska Imaging International, LLC, and we may acquire other businesses in the future.  The success of such transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls process to these acquired businesses.  The integration of acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.  Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first entered into the acquisition transaction.  If actual integration costs are higher than amounts originally anticipated, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely effected. 
    
  We may face costly legal disputes, including related to our intellectual property or technology or that of our suppliers or collaborators. 
    
  We may face legal disputes related to our business.  For example, on March 12, 2015, a complaint was filed against us by Shaun Fauley in the United States District Court Northern District of Illinois alleging our transmittal of unauthorized faxes in violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, as a class action seeking stated damages of the greater of actual monetary loss or five hundred dollars per violation.  Even if meritless, these disputes may require significant expenditures on our part and could entail a significant distraction to members of our management team or other key employees.  Insurance coverage may not cover any costs required to litigate a legal dispute or an unfavorable ruling or settlement.  A legal dispute leading to an unfavorable ruling or settlement, whether or not insurance coverage may be available for any portion thereof, could have significant material adverse consequences on our business. We may have to use legal means and incur affiliated costs to secure the benefits to which we are entitled, such as to collect payment for goods shipped to third parties, which would reduce our income as compared to what it otherwise would have been. 
    
  We may become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation in the United States or other countries or interference proceedings conducted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine the priority of inventions.  The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are likely to be costly, time-consuming and distracting.  As is typical in our industry, from time to time we and our collaborators and suppliers have received, and may in the future receive, notices from third parties claiming infringement and invitations to take licenses under third-party patents.  Any legal action against us or our collaborators or suppliers may require us or our collaborators or suppliers to obtain one or more licenses in order to market or manufacture effected products or services.  However, we or our collaborators or suppliers may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may not be able to develop alternative approaches if unable to obtain licenses or current and future licenses may not be adequate, any of which could substantially harm our business. 
  
   -33 

We may also need to pursue litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or our collaborative partners, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us or our collaborative partners, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.  Any litigation or interference proceedings will likely result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel.  Any adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties.  Further, as a result of litigation or other proceedings, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
    
  Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals in order to market our products may be costly and delay the marketing and sales of our products.  Failure to meet all regulatory requirements could cause significant losses from affected inventory and the loss of market share. 
    
  Many of the products we develop, market or manufacture may subject us to extensive regulation by one or more of the USDA, the FDA, the EPA and foreign and other regulatory authorities.  These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, advertising, promotion and sale of some of our products.  Satisfaction of these requirements can take several years and time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product.  The decision by a regulatory authority to regulate a currently non-regulated product or product area could significantly impact our revenue and have a corresponding adverse impact on our financial performance and position while we attempt to comply with the new regulation, if such compliance is possible at all. 
    
  The effect of government regulation may be to delay or to prevent marketing of our products for a considerable period of time and to impose costly procedures upon our activities.  We may not be able to estimate the time to obtain required regulatory approvals accurately and such approvals may require significantly more time than we anticipate.  We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, difficulties that could delay or prevent us from obtaining the regulatory approval or license necessary to introduce or market our products.  Such delays in approval may cause us to forego a significant portion of a new product's sales in its first year due to seasonality and advanced booking periods associated with certain products.  Regulatory approval of our products may also impose limitations on the indicated or intended uses for which our products may be marketed. 
    
  Difficulties in making established products to all regulatory specifications may lead to significant losses related to affected inventory as well as market share.  Among the conditions for certain regulatory approvals is the requirement that our facilities and/or the facilities of our third-party manufacturers conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices and other requirements.  If any regulatory authority determines that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers do not conform to appropriate manufacturing requirements, we or the manufacturers of our products may be subject to sanctions, including, but not limited to, warning letters, manufacturing suspensions, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the United States, refusals of regulatory authorities to grant approval or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications, civil fines and criminal prosecutions.  Furthermore, third parties may perceive procedures required to obtain regulatory approval objectionable and may attempt to disrupt or otherwise damage our business as a result.  In addition, certain of our agreements may require us to pay penalties if we are unable to supply products, including for failure to maintain regulatory approvals. 
    
  Any of these events, alone or in unison, could damage our business. 

-34 

If the third parties who have substantial marketing rights for certain of our historical products, existing products or future products under development are not successful in marketing those products, then our sales and financial position may suffer. 
    
  We are party to an agreement with Merck Animal Health, which grants Merck Animal Health exclusive distribution and marketing rights for our canine heartworm preventive product, TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets, ultimately sold to or through veterinarians in the United States and Canada.  Historically, a significant portion of our OVP segment's revenue has been generated from the sale of certain bovine vaccines, which have been sold primarily under the Titanium  and MasterGuard  brands. We have a supply agreement with Eli Lilly and its Affiliates operating through Elanco for the production of these vaccines. Either of these marketing partners may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our products and our sales and financial position could suffer significantly as a result. Revenue from Merck   Co., Inc. ("Merck") entities, including Merck Animal Health, represented 11% of our LTM revenue. Revenue from Eli Lilly entities, including Elanco, represented 14% of our LTM revenue. If Merck Animal Health personnel fail to market, sell and support our heartworm preventive sufficiently or if Elanco personnel fail to market, sell and support the bovine vaccines we produce and sell to Elanco sufficiently, our sales could decline significantly. Furthermore, there may be nothing to prevent these partners from pursuing alternative technologies, products or supply arrangements, including as part of mergers, acquisitions or divestitures. For example, we believe a unit of Merck has obtained FDA approval for a canine heartworm preventive product with additional claims compared with our TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets,  but which we believe is not currently being marketed actively. Should Merck decide to emphasize sales and marketing efforts of this product rather than our TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets or cancel our agreement regarding canine heartworm preventive distribution and marketing, our sales could decline significantly. In another example, if Elanco were to emphasize sales and marketing efforts for bovine vaccines other than those we produce or cancel our supply agreement and produce the vaccines we supply to them by themselves, our sales could decline significantly. Third-party marketing assistance may not be available in the future on reasonable terms, if at all. If the third parties with marketing rights for our products were to merge or go out of business, the sale and promotion of our products could be diminished. 
    
  We rely substantially on third-party suppliers.  The loss of products or delays in product availability from one or more third-party suppliers could substantially harm our business.  
    
  To be successful, we must contract for the supply of, or manufacture ourselves, current and future products of appropriate quantity, quality and cost.  Such products must be available on a timely basis and be in compliance with any regulatory requirements.  Similarly, we must provide ourselves, or contract for the supply of certain services.  Such services must be provided in a timely and appropriate manner.  Failure to do any of the above could substantially harm our business. 
    
  We rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture those products we do not manufacture ourselves and to provide services we do not provide ourselves.  Proprietary products provided by these suppliers represent a majority of our revenue.  We currently rely on these suppliers for our blood testing instruments and consumable supplies for these instruments, for our imaging products and related software and services, for key components of our point-of-care diagnostic tests as well as for the manufacture of other products. 
    
  The loss of access to products from one or more suppliers could have a significant, negative impact on our business. Major suppliers who sell us proprietary products who are responsible for more than 5% of our LTM revenue are FUJIFILM Corporation and Cuattro, LLC. None of these suppliers sold us products which were responsible for more than 25% of our LTM revenue, although products purchased from one of these suppliers was responsible for more than 20% of our LTM revenue and products purchased from another was responsible for more than 15% of our LTM revenue. We often purchase products from our suppliers under agreements that are of limited duration or potentially can be terminated on an annual basis.  In the case  
  
   -35 

of our blood testing instruments and our digital radiography solutions, post-termination, we are typically entitled to non-exclusive access to consumable supplies, or ongoing non-exclusive access to products and services to meet the needs of an existing customer base, respectively, for a defined period upon expiration of exclusive rights, which could subject us to competitive pressures in the period of non-exclusive access. Although we believe we will be able to maintain a supply of our major product and service offerings in the near future, there can be no assurance that our suppliers will meet their obligations under any agreements we may have in place with them or that we will be able to compel them to do so.  Risks of relying on suppliers include: 

Inability to meet minimum obligations.    Current agreements, or agreements we may negotiate in the future, may commit us to certain minimum purchase or other spending obligations. It is possible we will not be able to create the market demand to meet such obligations, which could create a drain on our financial resources and liquidity. Some such agreements may require minimum purchases and/or sales to maintain product rights and we may be significantly harmed if we are unable to meet such requirements and lose product rights.   
                
    Loss of exclusivity.    In the case of our blood testing instruments, if we are entitled to non-exclusive access to consumable supplies for a defined period upon expiration of exclusive rights, we may face increased competition from a third party with similar non-exclusive access or our former supplier, which could cause us to lose customers and/or significantly decrease our margins and could significantly affect our financial results.  In addition, current agreements, or agreements we may negotiate in the future, with suppliers may require us to meet minimum annual sales levels to maintain our position as the exclusive distributor of these products.  We may not meet these minimum sales levels and maintain exclusivity over the distribution and sale of these products.  If we are not the exclusive distributor of these products, competition may increase significantly, reducing our revenues and/or decreasing our margins. 
                
    Changes in economics.    An underlying change in the economics with a supplier, such as a large price increase or new requirement of large minimum purchase amounts, could have a significant, adverse effect on our business, particularly if we are unable to identify and implement an alternative source of supply in a timely manner. 
                
    The loss of product rights upon expiration or termination of an existing agreement.    Unless we are able to find an alternate supply of a similar product, we would not be able to continue to offer our customers the same breadth of products and our sales and operating results would likely suffer.  In the case of an instrument supplier, we could also potentially suffer the loss of sales of consumable supplies, which would be significant in cases where we have built a significant installed base, further harming our sales prospects and opportunities.  Even if we were able to find an alternate supply for a product to which we lost rights, we would likely face increased competition from the product whose rights we lost being marketed by a third party or the former supplier and it may take us additional time and expense to gain the necessary approvals and launch an alternative product. 
                
    High switching costs.    In our blood testing instrument products we could face significant competition and lose all or some of the consumable revenues from the installed base of those instruments if we were to switch to a competitive instrument.  If we need to change to other commercial manufacturing contractors for certain of our regulated products, additional regulatory licenses or approvals generally must be obtained for these contractors prior to our use.  This would require new testing and compliance inspections prior to sale, thus resulting in potential delays.  Any new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop, substantially equivalent processes necessary for the production of our products.  We likely would have to train our sales  
     
   -36 

force, distribution network employees and customer support organization on the new product and spend significant funds marketing the new product to our customer base. 
             
    The involuntary or voluntary discontinuation of a product line.    Unless we are able to find an alternate supply of a similar product in this or similar circumstances with any product, we would not be able to continue to offer our customers the same breadth of products and our sales would likely suffer.  Even if we are able to identify an alternate supply, it may take us additional time and expense to gain the necessary approvals and launch an alternative product, especially if the product is discontinued unexpectedly. 
                
    Inconsistent or inadequate quality control.    We may not be able to control or adequately monitor the quality of products we receive from our suppliers.  Poor quality items could damage our reputation with our customers. 
                
    Limited capacity or ability to scale capacity.    If market demand for our products increases suddenly, our current suppliers might not be able to fulfill our commercial needs, which would require us to seek new manufacturing arrangements and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand.  If we consistently generate more demand for a product than a given supplier is capable of handling, it could lead to large backorders and potentially lost sales to competitive products that are readily available.  This could require us to seek or fund new sources of supply, which may be difficult to find or may require terms that are less advantageous if available at all. 
                
    Regulatory risk.    Our manufacturing facility and those of some of our third-party suppliers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by regulatory authorities, including the FDA, USDA and other federal, state and foreign agencies for compliance with strictly enforced Good Manufacturing Practices, regulations and similar foreign standards.  We do not have control over our suppliers' compliance with these regulations and standards.  Regulatory violations could potentially lead to interruptions in supply that could cause us to lose sales to readily available competitive products. If one of our suppliers is unable to provide a raw material or finished product due to regulatory issues, it could have a material adverse financial impact on our business and could expose us to legal action if we are unable to perform on contracts to our customers involving related products. 
                
    Developmental delays.    We may experience delays in the scale-up quantities needed for product development that could delay regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products in development, causing us to miss key opportunities. 
                
    Limited geographic rights.    We typically do not have global geographic rights to products supplied by third parties.  If we were to determine a market opportunity in a geography where we did not have distribution rights and were unable to obtain such rights from the supplier, it might hamper our ability to succeed in such geography and our sales and profits would be lower than they otherwise would have been. 
                
    Limited intellectual property rights.    We typically do not have intellectual property rights, or may have to share intellectual property rights, to the products supplied by third parties and any improvements to the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for these products. 
       
  Potential problems with suppliers such as those discussed above could substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs and/or damage our reputation with our customers due to factors such as poor quality goods or delays in order fulfillment, resulting in our being unable to sell our products effectively and substantially harming our business. 

-37 

The loss of significant customers who, for example, are historically large purchasers or who are considered leaders in their field could damage our business and financial results. 
    
  Revenue from Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC d/b/a Henry Schein Animal Health ("Henry Schein") represented approximately 13% and 12% of our consolidated revenue for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 as well as 9% and 10% of our consolidated revenue for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015.  Revenue from Merck entities, including Merck Animal Health, represented approximately 11% and 12% of our consolidated revenue for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as well as 11% and 10% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Revenue from Eli Lilly entities, including Elanco, represented approximately 13% and 15% of our consolidated revenue for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as well as 10% and 13% for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 
    
  Merck entities accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated accounts receivable, Eli Lilly entities accounted for approximately 23% of our consolidated accounts receivable and Henry Schein  accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. 
    
  The loss of significant customers who, for example, are historically large purchasers or who are considered leaders in their field could damage our business, including via reputational damage, and financial results. 

-38 

We operate in a highly competitive industry, which could render our products obsolete or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell.  This would limit our ability to compete and maintain sustained profitability. 
    
  The market in which we compete is intensely competitive.  Our competitors include independent animal health companies and major pharmaceutical companies that have animal health divisions. We also compete with independent, third-party distributors, including distributors who sell products under their own private labels. In the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, our major competitors include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX"), Abaxis Inc. ("Abaxis"), and Zoetis Inc. ("Zoetis"). The products manufactured by our OVP segment for sale by third parties compete with similar products offered by a number of other companies, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources than us and may have more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than those of our OVP segment's customers. Competitors may have facilities with similar capabilities to our OVP segment, which they may operate and sell at a lower unit price to customers than our OVP segment does, which could cause us to lose customers. Companies with a significant presence in the companion animal health market, such as Bayer AG, CEVA Sant  Animale, Eli Lilly, Merck, Sanofi, V toquinol S.A. and Virbac S.A. may be marketing or developing products that compete with our products or would compete with them if developed. These and other competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and service organizations than we do. For example, if Zoetis devotes its significant commercial and financial resources to growing its market share in the veterinary allergy market, our allergy-related sales could suffer significantly. Our competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may also develop or market technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete. Further, additional competition could come from new entrants to the animal health care market. Moreover, we may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing, sales or support capabilities to compete successfully.  One of our competitors, Abaxis, recently announced agreements with units of VCA Inc. ("VCA") for the long-term supply of blood chemistry testing products to VCA-owned veterinary clinics and for the co-marketing of Abaxis' blood chemistry testing products with VCA's veterinary diagnostic laboratory offering, which may serve to intensify competition and lower our margins as well as limit our prospects to sell blood chemistry testing products to VCA-owned veterinary clinics. 
    
  If we fail to compete successfully, our ability to achieve sustained profitability will be limited and sustained profitability, or profitability at all, may not be possible  . 
    
  We depend on key personnel for our future success.  If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals. 
    
  Our future success is substantially dependent on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Kevin Wilson.  The loss of the services of members of our senior management or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.  Although we have employment agreements with many of these individuals, all are at-will employees, which means that either the employee or Heska may terminate employment at any time without prior notice.  If we lose the services of, or fail to recruit, key personnel, the growth of our business could be substantially impaired.  We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our senior management or key personnel. 
    
  We may be unable to market and sell our products successfully. 
    
  We may not develop and maintain marketing and/or sales capabilities successfully, and we may not be able to make arrangements with third parties to perform these activities on satisfactory terms.  If our  
  
   -39 

marketing and sales strategy is unsuccessful, our ability to sell our products will be negatively impacted and our revenues will decrease.  This could result in the loss of distribution rights for products or failure to gain access to new products and could cause damage to our reputation and adversely affect our business and future prospects. 
    
  The market for companion animal healthcare products is highly fragmented.  Because our CCA proprietary products are generally available only to veterinarians or by prescription and our medical instruments require technical training to operate, we ultimately sell all our CCA products primarily to or through veterinarians.  The acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success.  Changes in our ability to obtain or maintain such acceptance or changes in veterinary medical practice could significantly decrease our anticipated sales.  As the vast majority of cash flow to veterinarians ultimately is funded by pet owners without private insurance or government support, our business may be more susceptible to severe economic downturns than other health care businesses which rely less on individual consumers. 
    
  We recently have entered into agreements with independent third party distributors, including Henry Schein, which we expect to market and sell our products to a greater degree than in the recent past.  Our agreement with Henry Schein prohibits us from selling our chemistry blood testing products and our hematology blood testing products to an independent third party distributor other than Henry Schein.  Independent third-party distributors may be effective in increasing sales of our products to veterinarians, although we would expect a corresponding lower gross margin as such distributors typically buy products from us at a discount to end user prices.  It is possible new or existing independent third-party distributors could cannibalize our direct sales efforts and lower our total gross margin.  For us to be effective when working with an independent third-party distributor, the distributor must agree to market and/or sell our products and we must provide proper economic incentives to the distributor as well as contend effectively for the time, energy and focus of the employees of such distributor given other products the distributor may be carrying, potentially including those of our competitors.  If we fail to be effective with new or existing independent third-party distributors, our financial performance may suffer. 
    
  Our future revenues depend on successful product development, commercialization and/or market acceptance, any of which can be slower than we expect or may not occur.  
    
  The product development and regulatory approval process for many of our potential products is extensive and may take substantially longer than we anticipate.  Research projects may fail.  New products that we may be developing for the veterinary marketplace may not perform consistently within our expectations.  Because we have limited resources to devote to product development and commercialization, any delay in the development of one product or reallocation of resources to product development efforts that prove unsuccessful may delay or jeopardize the development of other product candidates.  If we fail to successfully develop new products and bring them to market in a timely manner, our ability to generate additional revenue will decrease. 
    
  Even if we are successful in the development of a product or obtain rights to a product from a third-party supplier, we may experience delays or shortfalls in commercialization and/or market acceptance of the product.  For example, veterinarians may be slow to adopt a product, a product may not achieve the anticipated technical performance in field use or there may be delays in producing large volumes of a product.  The former is particularly likely where there is no comparable product available or historical precedent for such a product.  The ultimate adoption of a new product by veterinarians, the rate of such adoption and the extent veterinarians choose to integrate such a product into their practice are all important factors in the economic success of one of our new products and are factors that we do not control to a large extent.  If our products do not achieve a significant level of market acceptance, demand for our products will not develop as expected and our revenues will be lower than we anticipate.  For example, our VitalPath Blood Gas and  
  
   -40 

Electrolyte Analyzer, supplied under an agreement, the ("Roche Agreement"), with   R  oche Diagnostics Corporation ("Roche"), generated significantly less revenue than we anticipated following its launch in May 2010 as placements of this product with customers did not occur as we expected. 
    
  We have historically not consistently generated positive cash flow from operations, may need additional capital and any required capital may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. 
    
  We may be required to raise additional capital in the future.  If necessary, we expect to raise these additional funds by borrowing under our revolving line of credit, the increased sale of customer leases, the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new term debt secured by the same category of assets as the term loans which we fully repaid in 2010.  There is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on reasonable terms, if at all, and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders.  Funds we expect to be available under our existing revolving line of credit may not be available and other lenders could refuse to provide us with additional debt financing.  Financial institutions and other potentially interested parties may not be interested in purchasing our customer leases on economic terms, or at all.  The public markets may be unreceptive to equity financings and we may not be able to obtain additional private equity or debt financing.  Any equity financing would likely be dilutive to stockholders and additional debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and increased interest rates that would limit our currently planned operations and strategies.  Furthermore, even if additional capital is available, it may not be of the magnitude required to meet our needs under these or other scenarios.  If additional funds are required and are not available, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our ability to continue as a going concern. 
    
  Our stock price has historically experienced high volatility, and could do so in the future, including experiencing a material price decline resulting from a large sale in a short period of time.  In addition, our Public Common Stock has certain transfer restrictions which could reduce trading liquidity from what it otherwise would have been and have other undesired effects. 
  Should a relatively large shareholder decide to sell a large number of shares in a short period of time, it could lead to an excess supply of our shares available for sale and correspondingly result in a significant decline in our stock price. 
    
  The securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of many microcap and small cap companies have in the past been, and can in the future be expected to be, especially volatile.  During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the closing stock price of our Public Common Stock has ranged from a low of $27.05 to a high of $56.16. Fluctuations in the trading price or liquidity of our Public Common Stock may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings.  Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price and marketability of our Public Common Stock include: 
             
    stock sales by large stockholders or by insiders; 
                
    changes in the outlook for our business; 
                
    our quarterly operating results, including as compared to expected revenue or earnings and in comparison to historical results; 
                
    termination, cancellation or expiration of our third-party supplier relationships; 
                
    announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors or by us; 
                
    litigation; 
                
    regulatory developments, including delays in product introductions; 
                
    developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights; 
                
    availability of our revolving line of credit and compliance with debt covenants; 
                
    releases of reports by securities analysts; 
     
   -41 

economic and other external factors; and 
                
    general market conditions. 
       
  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted.  If a securities class action suit is filed against us, it is likely we would incur substantial legal fees and our management's attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation. 
    
  On May 4, 2010, our shareholders approved an amendment (the "Amendment") to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  The Amendment places restrictions on the transfer of our stock that could adversely affect our ability to use our domestic Federal Net Operating Loss carryforward ("NOL").  In particular, the Amendment prevents the transfer of shares without the approval of our Board of Directors if, as a consequence, an individual, entity or groups of individuals or entities would become a 5-percent holder under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the related Treasury regulations, and also prevents any existing 5-percent holder from increasing his or her ownership position in the Company without the approval of our Board of Directors.  Any transfer of shares in violation of the Amendment (a "Transfer Violation") shall be void   ab initio   under the our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our "Certificate of Incorporation") and our Board of Directors has procedures under our Certificate of Incorporation to remedy a Transfer Violation including requiring the shares causing such Transfer Violation to be sold and any profit resulting from such sale to be transferred to a charitable entity chosen by the Company's Board of Directors in specified circumstances.  The Amendment could have an adverse impact on the value and trading liquidity of our stock if certain buyers who would otherwise have bid on or purchased our stock, including buyers who may not be comfortable owning stock with transfer restrictions, do not bid on or purchase our stock as a result of the Amendment.  In addition, because some corporate takeovers occur through the acquirer's purchase, in the public market or otherwise, of sufficient shares to give it control of a company, any provision that restricts the transfer of shares can have the effect of preventing a takeover.  The Amendment could discourage or otherwise prevent accumulations of substantial blocks of shares in which our stockholders might receive a substantial premium above market value and might tend to insulate management and the Board of Directors against the possibility of removal to a greater degree than had the Amendment not passed. 
    
  Interpretation of existing legislation, regulations and rules, including financial accounting standards, or implementation of future legislation, regulations and rules could cause our costs to increase or could harm us in other ways. 
    
  We prepare our financial statements in conformance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.  These accounting principles are established by and are subject to interpretation by the SEC, the FASB and others who interpret and create accounting policies.  A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is made effective.  Such changes may adversely affect our reported financial results, the way we conduct our business or have a negative impact on us if we fail to track such changes.  
    
  If our regulators and/or auditors adopt or interpret more stringent standards than we anticipate, we could experience unanticipated changes in our reported financial statements, including but not limited to restatements, which could adversely affect our business due to litigation and investor confidence in our financial statements.  In addition, changes in the underlying circumstances to which we apply given accounting standards and principles may affect our results of operations and have a negative impact on us.  For example, we review goodwill recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at least annually and if we were to conclude there was an impairment of goodwill, we would reduce the corresponding goodwill to its estimated fair value and recognize a corresponding expense in our statement of operations.  This impairment and corresponding expense could be as large as the total amount of goodwill recognized on our consolidated  
  
   -42 

balance sheets, which was $26.8 million at September 30, 2016.  There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur if projected financial results are not met, or otherwise. 
    
  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") has increased our required administrative actions and expenses as a public company since its enactment.  The general and administrative costs of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley will depend on how it is interpreted over time.  Of particular concern are the level of standards for internal control evaluation and reporting adopted under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley.  If our regulators and/or auditors adopt or interpret more stringent standards than we anticipate, we and/or our auditors may be unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our financial statements and cause our stock price to decline.  Even if we and our auditors are able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is designed and operating effectively in such a circumstance, our general and administrative costs are likely to increase. For example, in 2015, we were required to have our independent registered public accountant conduct an audit of our internal control over financial reporting because as of June 30, 2015 our stock market value was above a certain level prescribed by regulation.  This increased our general and administrative costs from what they otherwise would have been. 
    
  Similarly, we are required to comply with the SEC's mandate to provide interactive data using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language as an exhibit to certain SEC filings.  Compliance with this mandate has required a significant time investment, which has and may in the future preclude some of our employees from spending time on more productive matters.  In addition, actions by other entities, such as enhanced rules to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, could also increase our general and administrative costs or have other adverse effects on us, as could further legislative, regulatory or rule-making action or more stringent interpretations of existing legislation, regulations and rules. 
    
  Our Public Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and we may not be able to maintain that listing, which may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.  In addition, we have less than 300 holders of record, which would allow us to terminate voluntarily the registration of our common stock with the SEC and after which we would no longer be eligible to maintain the listing of our Public Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.   
    
  Our Public Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.  The Nasdaq has several quantitative and qualitative requirements companies must comply with to maintain this listing. While we believe we are currently in compliance with all Nasdaq requirements, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet Nasdaq listing requirements, that Nasdaq will interpret these requirements in the same manner we do if we believe we meet the requirements, or that Nasdaq will not change such requirements or add new requirements to include requirements we do not meet in the future.  If we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Public Common Stock may be considered a penny stock under the regulations of the SEC and would therefore be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities.  The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Public Common Stock, which could severely limit market liquidity of the Public Common Stock and any stockholder's ability to sell our securities in the secondary market.  This lack of liquidity would also likely make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future. 
    
  We have less than 300 holders of record as of our latest information, a fact which would make us eligible to terminate voluntarily the registration of our common stock with the SEC and therefore suspend our reporting obligations with the SEC under the Exchange Act and become a non-reporting company.  If we were to cease reporting with the SEC, we would no longer be eligible to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which we would expect to materially adversely affect the liquidity and market price for our common stock.

We often depend on third parties for products we intend to introduce in the future.  If our current relationships and collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to introduce the products we intend to introduce in the future. 
    
  We are often dependent on third parties and collaborative partners to successfully and timely perform research and development activities to successfully develop new products.  For example, we jointly developed point-of-care diagnostic products with Quidel Corporation.  In other cases, we have discussed Heska marketing in the veterinary market an instrument being developed by a third party for use in the human health care market.  In the future, one or more of these third parties or collaborative partners may not complete research and development activities in a timely fashion, or at all.  Even if these third parties are successful in their research and development activities, we may not be able to come to an economic agreement with them.  If these third parties or collaborative partners fail to complete research and development activities, fail to complete them in a timely fashion, or if we are unable to negotiate economic agreements with such third parties or collaborative partners, our ability to introduce new products will be impacted negatively and our revenues may decline.  For example, we have experienced significant delays compared to our expectations in our development of products in collaboration with Rapid Diagnostek, Inc. 
    
  We may not be able to continue to achieve sustained profitability or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 
    
  Prior to 2005, we incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception in 1988 and, as of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of   $156.5 million  .  Relatively small differences in our performance metrics may cause us to generate an operating or net loss in future periods.  Our ability to continue to be profitable in future periods will depend, in part, on our ability to increase sales in our CCA segment, including maintaining and growing our installed base of instruments and related consumables, to maintain or increase gross margins and to limit the increase in our operating expenses to a reasonable level as well as avoid or effectively manage any unanticipated issues.  We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.  If we cannot achieve or sustain profitability for an extended period, we may not be able to fund our expected cash needs, including the repayment of debt as it comes due, or continue our operations. 
    
  Many of our expenses are fixed and if factors beyond our control cause our revenue to fluctuate, this fluctuation could cause greater than expected losses, cash flow and liquidity shortfalls. 
  We believe that our future operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors which are generally beyond our control, including: 
             
    supply of products from third-party suppliers or termination, cancellation or expiration of such relationships; 
                
    competition and pricing pressures from competitive products; 
                
    the introduction of new products or services by our competitors or by us; 
                
    large customers failing to purchase at historical levels; 
                
    fundamental shifts in market demand; 
                
    manufacturing delays; 
                
    shipment problems; 
                
    information technology problems, which may prevent us from conducting our business effectively, or at all, and may also raise our costs; 
                
    regulatory and other delays in product development; 
                
    product recalls or other issues which may raise our costs; 
                
    changes in our reputation and/or market acceptance of our current or new products; and 
                
    changes in the mix of products sold. 

-44 

We have high operating expenses, including those related to personnel.  Many of these expenses are fixed in the short term and may increase over time.  If any of the factors listed above cause our revenues to decline, our operating results could be substantially harmed. 
    
  If we are unable to maintain various financial and other covenants required by our credit facility agreement we will be unable to borrow any funds under the agreement and fund our operations.  
    
  Under our credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo, we are required to comply with various covenants, both financial and non-financial, in order to borrow under the agreement.  The availability of borrowings under this agreement is expected to be important to continue to fund our operations.  A key financial covenant is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo.  Although we believe we will be able to maintain compliance with all these covenants and any covenants we may negotiate in the future, there can be no assurance thereof.  We have not always been able to maintain compliance with all covenants under our credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo.  Although Wells Fargo has granted us a waiver of non-compliance in each case, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain similar waivers or other modifications if needed in the future on economic terms, if at all.  Failure to comply with any of the covenants, representations or warranties, or failure to modify them to allow future compliance, could result in our being in default and could cause all outstanding borrowings under our credit and security agreement to become immediately due and payable, or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement.  In addition, Wells Fargo has discretion in setting the advance rates which we may borrow against eligible assets.  We may need to rely on available borrowings under the credit and security agreement to fund our operations in the future.  If we are unable to borrow funds under this agreement, we will need to raise additional capital from other sources to continue our operations, which capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 
    
  We may face product returns and product liability litigation in excess of, or not covered by, our insurance coverage or indemnities and/or warranties from our suppliers.  If we become subject to product liability claims resulting from defects in our products, we may fail to achieve market acceptance of our products and our sales could substantially decline.  
    
  The testing, manufacturing and marketing of our current products as well as those currently under development entail an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity.  Following the introduction of a product, adverse side effects may be discovered.  Adverse publicity regarding such effects could affect sales of our other products for an indeterminate time period.  To date, we have not experienced any material product liability claims, but any claim arising in the future could substantially harm our business.  Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy.  We may not be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all.  In the event that we are held liable for a claim against which we are not indemnified or for damages exceeding the $10 million limit of our insurance coverage or which results in significant adverse publicity against us, we may lose revenue, be required to make substantial payments which could exceed our financial capacity and/or lose or fail to achieve market acceptance. 
    
  We may be held liable for the release of hazardous materials, which could result in extensive remediation costs or otherwise harm our business. 
    
  Certain of our products and development programs produced at our Des Moines, Iowa facility involve the controlled use of hazardous and bio hazardous materials, including chemicals and infectious disease agents.  Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable local, state and federal regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.  In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any fines, penalties, remediation costs or other damages that result.  Our liability for the release of  
  
   -45 

hazardous materials could exceed our resources, which could lead to a shutdown of our operations, significant remediation costs and potential legal liability.  In addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations if we choose to expand our manufacturing capacity.

Exhibit 3.1 

Amended and Restated Bylaws as approved on May 16, 2002, as further amended 
   on May 4, 2010, February 19, 2014 and September 22, 2016. 
  B Y L A W S 
  OF 
  HESKA CORPORATION 
  (a Delaware corporation) 

ARTICLE 1 
    
  Offices 
    
  1.1      Principal Office  .  The registered office of the corporation shall be 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware. 
    
  1.2      Additional Offices.    The corporation may also have offices at such other places, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors (the "Board") may from time to time designate or the business of the corporation may require. 
    
  ARTICLE 2 
    
  Meeting of Stockholders 
    
  2.1      Place of Meeting.    Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by or in the manner provided in these Bylaws, or, if not so designated, as determined by the Board. 
    
  2.2      Annual Meeting  .  Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held each year at such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting.  At such annual meetings, the stockholders shall elect by a plurality vote the number of directors equal to the number of directors of the class whose term expires at such meetings (or, if fewer, the number of directors properly nominated and qualified for election) to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election.  The stockholders shall also transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meetings. 
  To be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record.  In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered personally or deposited in the United States mail, or delivered to a common carrier for transmission to the recipient or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means to the recipient or sent by other means of written communication, postage or delivery charges prepaid in all such cases, and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation, not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which notice of the prior year's annual meeting was mailed to stockholders.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class,  

series and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially by the stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.  Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting. 
  The Chair of the Board of the corporation (or such other person presiding at the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws) shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. 
  2.3      Special Meetings.    Special meetings of the stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, only at the request of the Chair of the Board, by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board.  Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.  Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting. 
  2.4      Action Without a Meeting.    Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of this corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing or electronic transmission, setting forth the action or actions so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  Written consent or consents and, unless the Board otherwise provides, reproduction in paper form of electronic consent or consents, shall be delivered to the corporation by hand or certified mail, return receipt requested, to its principal executive office, or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.   
  2.5      Notice of Meetings.    Except as otherwise required by law, written notice of stockholders' meetings, stating the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such special meeting is called, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting. 
  When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, if any, date and time thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the  
  
   -   2   - 

adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, if any, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith.  At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. 
  Whenever, under the provisions of Delaware law or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice (a) may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such stockholder, at his or her address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail or (b) may be given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. 
  Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of Delaware law or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. 
  2.6      Business Matter of a Special Meeting  .  Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice, except to the extent such notice is waived or is not required. 
  2.7      List of Stockholders  .  The officer in charge of the stock ledger of the corporation or the transfer agent shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present in person thereat.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 
  2.8      Organization and Conduct of Business  .  The Chair of the Board or, in his or her absence, the Lead Director, or in their absence, the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or, in their absence, such person as the Board may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as Chair of the meeting.  In the absence of the Secretary of the corporation, the Secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the Chair appoints. 
  
   -   3   - 

The Chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her in order.

  Loveland, CO 80538 
    
  RE: Change to Concentration Limits  
    
  Dear Dan: 
    
  You requested Wells Fargo make a change to the customer concentration limits as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 30, 2005.  This provision is detailed in Section 1.1, definition of Eligible Accounts, item (xii).  Currently that section allows for [***] to be eligible up to 25% of all Accounts and [***] to be eligible up to 20% of all Accounts.  You requested the concentration limit for those accounts, as well as that for [***] to be increased to 35%.    
    
  Effective with this letter, Section 1.1, Eligible Accounts (xii) is replaced in its entirety as follows: 
    
   That portion of the aggregate Accounts of a single customer owed to all Borrowers in the aggregate that exceeds 15% of all Accounts of all Borrowers in the aggregate; provided, however, that for the customers listed below, such limit shall instead be the greater of the foregoing or the amount set forth opposite such customer in the  following table: 
    
  Customer                 Concentration Limit 
  [***]                    35% 
  [***]                    35% 
  [***]                    35%  
    
  Please sign below indicating your acknowledgement and agreement with this change and return a signed copy of this letter to my attention. 
    
  As always, please let me know if you have any questions. 

Sincerely, 

[***]                 
  [***] 
  [***]

              a.

              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
