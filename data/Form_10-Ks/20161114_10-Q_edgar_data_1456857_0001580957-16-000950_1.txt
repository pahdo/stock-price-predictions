    Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

  September 30, 2016  

Note 1   Interim Financial Statements  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
all of the information and footnotes required for audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to make the condensed consolidated financial statements not misleading
have been included. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015, has been derived from the Company s audited consolidated
financial statements as of that date.  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that are included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, that was filed with the SEC on March 30,
2016. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full year. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 5353 Joliet, LLC, MJ Havana, LLC, and MJ Sheridan, LLC. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

The significant accounting policies followed by the Company
for interim reporting are consistent with those included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. The Company adopted the following accounting policy during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Real Estate Loans Receivable   

The Company s real estate loans receivable are recorded
at amortized cost, net of loan loss reserves, and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date. The amortized cost of a
real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and
unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan, if applicable. 

Interest income on the Company s real estate loans receivable
is recognized as revenue on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. Direct loan origination
fees and origination or acquisition costs, if applicable, are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest
income. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB )
issued guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a comprehensive framework
for revenue recognition that supersedes current general revenue guidance and most industry-specific guidance. In addition, the
guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. An entity should apply the guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative adjustment at the date of the initial application. In July 2015, the FASB delayed
the effective date of the new guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within that reporting period. Early adoption is now permitted after the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The
Company is still evaluating the impact of 

6   

adopting the new accounting guidance, but does not expect the
adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, FASB issued guidance that requires management
to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as
a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations
as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company adopted this guidance for
the annual period ending December 31, 2016, beginning with the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance
primarily addressed certain disclosures to the financial statements and had no impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation
of debt issuance costs. This guidance provides that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company adopted
this guidance with the annual and the interim period beginning January 1, 2016, and applied the standard on a retrospective basis
as of December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had $3,416 and $11,357, respectively, of debt
issuance costs associated with $2.7 million of notes payable that were reclassified from other assets to a reduction in the carrying
amount of the notes payable. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position and did not
impact our results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 3   Going Concern  

The Company s financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated net income of $65,920. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1,383,571 and a working capital deficit of $2,413,041, consisting
of cash and prepaid expenses of $428,709 less promissory notes for $2,725,000 due within the next twelve months and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities of $116,750. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The Company s future success is dependent upon its ability
to achieve and maintain profitable operations, generate cash from operating activities, refinance existing debt obligations and/or
obtain additional financing. Although we can provide no assurances, we believe our cash on hand, coupled with revenues generated
by rental income and our ability to refinance our equity in the real estate we own, will provide sufficient liquidity and capital
resources to fund our business for the next twelve months. 

In the event the Company experiences liquidity and capital resource
constraints because of unanticipated operating losses, we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity and/or debt
financing. If such additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, then we may need to curtail our operations
and/or take additional measures to conserve and manage our liquidity and capital resources, any of which would have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and our ability to continue in existence. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Note 4   Real Estate Loans Receivable  

In May 2016, the Company invested $150,000 in a $1,750,000 promissory
note secured by the assignment of a mortgage on real estate property located in Miami, Florida. The mortgage was held by Chemtov
Mortgage Group ( CMG ), an entity wholly-owned by the Company s co-CEO, Shawn Chemtov. The Company did not incur any
loan origination fees or any other costs associated with the mortgage investment. 

The promissory note paid interest at 12% per annum and provided
for cash interest payments on a monthly basis, commencing on July 1, 2016. The outstanding principal amount and any unpaid interest
were due on May 19, 2017. The promissory note contained a prepayment charge equal to six months of interest on the prepaid amount
less interest paid to the date of such prepayment. 

7   

In September 2016, the promissory note was repaid in full, including
$3,600 of additional interest as a result of the prepayment. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded $6,900 and $9,039, respectively, of revenue generated by interest income from the $150,000 real estate loan receivable. 

Note 5   Real Estate Property Acquisitions  

5353 Joliet Street   

In June 2014, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 5353 Joliet
LLC, the Company acquired an owner-occupied 22,144 square feet industrial building situated on 1.4 acres of land in Denver, Colorado
for $2,214,000. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from the issuance of a secured promissory note in the amount of $1,800,000
and $414,000 of cash on-hand. The promissory note is held by CMG, an entity wholly-owned by the Company s co-CEO, Shawn Chemtov.
CMG has assigned all ownership and security interest granted to it pursuant to the promissory note to 5353 Mortgage Loan, LLC,
a single purpose entity created solely for the purpose of this transaction. CMG invested $100,000 of the $1,800,000 of funds used
to finance the purchase of the promissory note. CMG acts as the loan servicing entity for the promissory note, administering the
note, processing payments from the Company, and transferring all payments to 5353 Mortgage Loan, LLC. CMG charges no administration
fees for servicing the promissory note. 

The promissory note bears interest at 10% per annum, provides
for cash interest payments on a monthly basis, matured on June 1, 2016. The Company is currently in the process of refinancing
or extending the due date of the promissory note. In the interim, the Company continues paying the monthly interest payments. The
Company has guaranteed the promissory note and has pledged its ownership interest in 5353 Joliet LLC, and as such its fee-simple
ownership interest in the property as security for the promissory note. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recorded $135,000 and $135,000, respectively, of interest expense related to the promissory note. 

In September 2014, the Company entered into a lease agreement
contingent upon the lessee obtaining city and state licenses and permits for its intended operations at the premises. The contingencies
were met by the lessee, and the lease agreement became effective December 1, 2014. The lease agreement is for a term of seven years.
Insurance and real property taxes shall be paid by the Company and, subsequently, charged to the lessee as additional rent based
on the actual expenses incurred - see Note 6 below for additional lease details. 

503 Havana Street   

In September 2014, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, MJ Havana
LLC, the Company acquired an owner-occupied 1,250 square foot building situated on 23,625 square feet of land in Aurora, Colorado
for $756,000, exclusive of closing costs. The acquisition was funded with cash on-hand. The property is zoned B-2 and has been
approved by the city of Aurora as a retail dispensary for recreational marijuana. 

Prior to closing on the property acquisition, the Company had
pre-negotiated a 10-year lease agreement with a third-party, a licensed marijuana dispensary company serving both medical and adult
(21+) customers in Colorado. Once the closing of the property was completed with the seller, the pre-negotiated lease was executed
in September 2014 with the third-party. Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, the Company agreed to contribute $150,000
to improvements to the property - see Note 6 below for additional lease details. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had paid
$150,000 towards the tenant s building improvements. 

1126 South Sheridan Boulevard   

In May 2015, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, MJ Sheridan
LLC, the Company acquired real estate property located at 1126 South Sheridan Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, for $771,750, exclusive
of closing costs. The Company funded the acquisition through the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $925,000 to a related
party of which $771,750 was used to purchase the property. The balance of the funds will be used by the Company as working capital.
The acquired property is 17,729 square feet with a 3,828 square foot one story free-standing 

8   

building. The property is zoned B-2 and has been approved by
the city of Denver as a retail dispensary for recreational marijuana. 

The promissory note is held by CMG, an entity wholly-owned by
the Company s co-CEO, Shawn Chemtov. CMG has assigned all ownership and security interest granted to it pursuant to the promissory
note to a single purpose entity created solely for the purpose of this transaction. CMG acts as the loan servicing entity for the
promissory note, administering the note and processing payments from the Company. CMG charges no administration fees for servicing
the promissory note. 

The promissory note bears interest at 10% per annum, provides
for cash interest payments on a monthly basis, matures on June 1, 2017. The promissory note is collateralized with the Company s
ownership interest in the newly acquired property and its previously acquired property located at 503 Havana Street in Aurora,
Colorado. The promissory note does not restrict the Company s ability to incur future indebtedness. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $69,375 and $37,929, respectively, of interest expense related to the promissory note. 

Prior to closing on the property acquisition, the Company had
pre-negotiated a 10-year lease agreement with a third-party, a licensed marijuana dispensary company serving both medical and adult
(21+) customers in Colorado. Once the closing of the property was completed with the seller, the pre-negotiated lease was executed
in May 2015 with the third-party - see Note 6 below for additional lease details. 

A summary of real estate property at September 30, 2016, is
as follows: 

Note 6   Operating Leases  

The Company generates revenues by leasing its acquired real
estate properties through operating leasing arrangements. A summary of revenues generated from our rental properties for the three

to the property. 

Upon the expiration of the term of ten years, the Lessee has

Note 8   Stock Based Compensation  

Warrants   

A summary of warrants issued, exercised and expired during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, is as follows: 

Common Stock   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
issued 149,417 shares of common stock for consulting services and recorded $139,134 of stock-based compensation expense for these
consulting services, which has been classified as General and administrative expenses. The stock-based compensation expense was
calculated based on the grant date fair value of the common stock shares issued in exchange for the consulting services. 

Note 9   Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. 

The Company did not incur any federal or state income tax expense
or benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating losses
of approximately $684,000 for federal and state income tax purposes that can be carried forward for up to twenty years and deducted
against future federal taxable income. The taxable income generated as a result of the Company s net income of $65,920 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, was completely offset by the available net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
income tax purposes. Based on the expected taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2016, the Company does not expect to
incur alternative minimum tax on its net alternative minimum taxable income for the year. The net operating loss carryforwards
expire in various years through 2035. All of the federal and state net operating losses incurred prior to 2014 are subject to 100
percent limitation under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 382 due to an ownership change and the continuity of business
requirement.  

Note 10   Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common
Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the
net income or net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated using the treasury stock method and reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if warrants were exercised and were not anti-dilutive. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share were the same since
there were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the respective periods. The outstanding warrants as of September 30,
2016 and 2015, to purchase 166,665 shares of common stock that were not included in the calculations of diluted income per share
because the impact would have been anti-dilutive for each of the periods presented.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Our Management s
Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related
notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.  

Forward-Looking Statements   

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements
and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information
currently available to, our management. When used in this report, the words  believe,   anticipate,   expect, 
 will,   estimate,   intend ,  plan  and similar expressions, as they relate to
us or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the plans, objectives, expectations
and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that our plans,
objectives, expectations and prospects will be achieved. Important factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially
from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in the  Risk Factors  section of and
elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and in our subsequent filings with
the SEC, and include, among others, the following: marijuana is illegal under federal law, competition, our business is dependent
on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry, government regulation, our business model depends on the availability of private
funding, we will be subject to general real estate risks and the availability, if debt payments to note holder are not made we
could lose our investment in our real estate properties, terms and deployment of capital. The terms  MJ Holdings, Inc., 
 MJ Holdings,   MJ,   we,   us,   our,  and the  Company 
refer to MJ Holdings, Inc.   

Business Overview  

MJ Holdings owns and leases real estate zoned for legalized
marijuana operations to licensed marijuana operators. We also invest in real estate-related investments, not necessarily related
to the marijuana industry. In addition to our portfolio of income producing real estate and real estate-related investments, MJ
Holdings owns, operates and is developing a portfolio of business units related to the regulated marijuana industry, including
internet websites and mobile apps. 

The Company does not and will not, until such time as Federal
law allows, grow, harvest, distribute or sell marijuana or any substances that violate the laws of the United States of America. 

We have devised our current business strategy based on certain
limitations related to the legal status of marijuana under federal law and the fact that we are a public company and make certain
representations and warranties in connection with our public filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
We recognize the significant opportunities in the legalized marijuana space and believe that using our current business model,
we can position ourselves to not only develop a significant business along our current path, but be able to leverage our position,
relationships and assets to capitalize on additional opportunities in the future, if and when federal law reconciles with state
law; resulting in the federal legalization of marijuana. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

12   

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires
an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made,
and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely
to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies
reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 

Deferred Leasing Costs   

Commissions and other direct costs associated with the acquisition
of tenants, or lessees, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs associated
with unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed. 

Deferred leasing costs charged to property expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $20,841 and $20,624, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, $136,622 of deferred
leasing costs are included on the Balance Sheet as a deferred asset. 

Debt Issuance Costs    

Costs associated with obtaining, closing, and modifying loans
and/or debt instruments such as, but not limited to placement agent fees, attorney fees and state documentary fees are capitalized
and charged to interest expense over the term of the loan. 

Debt issuance costs charged to interest expense for the nine
months ended September, 2016 and 2015, were $7,941 and $9,470, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, $3,416 of debt issuance
costs are included on the Balance Sheet as a reduction in the carrying amount of notes payable to a related party. 

Real Estate Property    

Real estate property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Real estate property, excluding land, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the related
lease term or useful life. Maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are charged to expense as incurred; major renewals and
betterments that extend the useful life of the associated asset are capitalized. When real estate property is sold or retired,
the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in results of operations
for the period. 

Real Estate Loans Receivable   

The Company s real estate loans receivable are recorded
at amortized cost, net of loan loss reserves, and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date. The amortized cost of a
real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and
unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan, if applicable. 

Revenue Recognition    

Before revenue can be recognized, four basic criteria must be
met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or
determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. 

The Company s revenues include rental income generated by leasing
acquired real estate properties to licensed marijuana operators. All leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Straight-line rent is recognized for all tenants with contractual
fixed increases in rent. Deferred rent receivable represents rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed
rents. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as rental income
in the period the applicable costs are incurred.  

13   

The Company generates revenues through interest income earned
on investments in real estate loans receivable, such as mortgages. Interest income is recognized as revenue on an accrual basis
over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. Direct loan origination fees and origination or acquisition
costs, if applicable, are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income. 

Income Taxes   

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. 

Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized
if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized
any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. 

Results of Operations For the Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue   

Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
was $188,398 and $528,531, respectively, compared with revenue of $169,879 and $458,566,respectively, for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were generated as a result
of rental income from operating leases for three real estate properties and interest income from an investment in a real estate
loan receivable. Revenue increased by $18,519 and $69,965, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared with revenue for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of rental income generated by the
third real estate property acquired in May 2015 and increases in certain property expenses reimbursed to the Company.  

Certain property expenses are reimbursable to the Company through
our existing leasing arrangements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $26,587 and
$57,881, respectively, of revenue pursuant to operating lease agreements to offset a portion of the property expenses incurred
during the respective periods compared with $15,646 and $41,576, respectively, of revenue recorded during the three and nine month
ended September 30, 2015, to offset a portion of the property expenses incurred during the respective periods. 

Operating Expenses   

Property expenses  consist of those costs associated with
acquiring and leasing real estate properties. These expenses include costs for commissions, appraisals, real property taxes, insurance,
repairs and maintenance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred property expenses of $31,278 and $94,977,
respectively, compared with $23,032 and $100,981, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The increase of $8,246 in property expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily attributed to increases in real
property taxes and repairs and maintenance charges during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

14   

The decrease of $6,004 in property expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily attributed to a decrease in costs
for repairs and maintenance, partially offset by increases in costs for real property taxes during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

General and administrative expenses  for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $9,348 and $67,726, respectively, compared with general and administrative expenses
of $69,526 and $231,504, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The decreases of $60,178 and $163,778, respectively, in general
and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were primarily attributed to decreases in consulting
fees and legal fees, of which $57,884 and $139,134, respectively, was for non-cash stock-based compensation for consulting services
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which were partially offset by an increase in travel related expenses
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation expense  for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, was $29,605 and $87,681, respectively, compared with depreciation expense of $28,871 and $73,544, respectively,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, were primarily associated with depreciation of the third real estate property acquired in May 2015. 

Other Expenses   

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
decreased by $2,464 to $69,379 compared with interest expense of $71,843 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was due to a decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs
charged to interest expense for the interim period. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
increased by $29,850 to $212,227 compared with interest expense of $182,377 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to interest expense incurred on a $925,000
promissory note used to fund a real estate property acquisition in May 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization
of debt issuance costs. 

We had net income of $48,788, or a basic and diluted income
per share of $0.003, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $23,393, or a basic and diluted
loss per share of $0.002, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had net income of $65,920, or a basic and diluted earnings
per share of $0.005, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $129,840, or a basic and diluted
loss per share of $0.009, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The increase in earnings of $72,181 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, and the increase in earnings of $195,760 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were due to the increases
in revenues and the decreases in operating expenses described above, partially offset by the increases in interest expense associated
with the additional debt to acquire our third real estate property acquisition in May 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The following table summarizes the cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The Company had cash of $421,760 at September 30, 2016, compared
with cash of $303,368 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $118,392. The increase in cash during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, was attributed to cash generated by operating activities of $122,366, partially offset by cash used for building improvements. 

15   

Operating Activities  

We had net cash provided by operating activities of $122,366
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted of net income of $65,920 and non-cash charges of $84,570; partially
offset by a decrease of $25,035 in security deposits, which was used for rental income during the period, a decrease of $2,233
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and an increase of $856 in prepaid and other assets. 

We had net cash provided by operating activities of $18,279
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which consisted of non-cash charges of $206,502, a decrease in prepaid and other
assets of $50,222, and a decrease in deferred leasing costs of $17,511; partially offset by a decrease of $119,274 in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, a net loss of $129,840, and a decrease in security deposits of $6,842. 

Investing Activities  

Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement for the real estate
property located in Aurora, Colorado, the Company agreed to contribute $150,000 to improvements to the property. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $3,974 for building improvements to the property in Aurora, Colorado. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had paid $150,000 towards the improvements to the property in Aurora, Colorado. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased
a 3,828 square feet retail building in Denver, Colorado for $771,750. In addition, we paid $123,393 for building improvements to
property in Aurora, Colorado. 

Financing Activities  

There were no financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

We had $914,366 in net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which consisted of proceeds of $925,000 from the issuance of a promissory note, partially
offset by debt issuance costs of $10,634. 

Although we can provide no assurances, we believe our cash on
hand, coupled with revenues generated by rental and interest income from our real estate investments and our ability to refinance
our equity in the real estate we own, will provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our business for the next
twelve months. In the event we experience liquidity and capital resources constraints because of unanticipated operating losses,
we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity and/or debt financing. If such additional capital is not available
on terms acceptable to us or at all then we may need to curtail our operations and/or take additional measures to conserve and
manage our liquidity and capital resources, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

16   

Seasonality  

We do not consider our business to be seasonal. 

Inflation and Changing Prices  

Neither inflation or changing prices for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, had a material impact on our operations.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER CERTIFICATION   

I, Adam Laufer, certify that:  

1.    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report
                                         on Form 10-Q of MJ Holdings, Inc.;    

2.    Based on my knowledge, this report
                                         does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
