1. Intralinks Holdings, Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Intralinks Holdings, Inc. ("Intralinks Holdings") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") is a leading global provider of Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") solutions for secure enterprise content collaboration within and among organizations. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in June 1996. The Company's cloud-based solutions enable organizations to manage, control, track, search, exchange and collaborate on sensitive information, inside and outside of the firewall, all within a secure and easy-to-use environment. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intralinks Holdings and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The financial statements contained herein are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related to (a) allowances for doubtful accounts and reserves for customer credits, (b) the fair values of the Company's single operating segment and reporting unit, goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and long-term investments, (c) the recoverability of its definite-lived intangible assets, capitalized software and fixed assets (and their related useful lives), (d) certain components of the income tax provision (including the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and liabilities for uncertain tax positions), (e) accruals for certain compensation and benefit expenses and (f) the fair value of stock-based awards including estimated forfeitures of such awards. The Company bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue. ASU 2014-09 supersedes current revenue recognition guidance and requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  . The amendment in this update deferred the effective date of implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is now effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , amending the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09. The amendment clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which amends certain aspects of the guidance set forth in the FASB's new revenue standard related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical

Expedients  , which clarifies implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09 on assessing collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  , which clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. As a result of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, at   December 31, 2015  , the Company reclassified capitalized deferred debt issuance costs of   $0.5 million   from "Other current assets" to "Current portion of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs" and   $1.0 million   from "Other non-current assets" to "Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs." 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in "Leases (Topic 840)" and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies the accounting for employee stock-based payment. This update provides clarification on guidance for employee share-based payments, in particular areas including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  2. Investments and Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company has classified its investments in corporate securities as held-to-maturity and, as such, has recorded them at amortized cost. Interest earned on these corporate securities is included in  Other expense (income), net  within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gross unrealized holding gains and losses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not material. 
  The Company held no investments at   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes these investments at   December 31, 2015  :  

The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
             
    Level 1:  Fair value measurement of the asset or liability using observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
                
    Level 2:  Fair value measurement of the asset or liability using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and 
                
    Level 3:  Fair value measurement of the asset or liability using unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

The following tables present the Company's financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   

The Company's non-financial assets, which include goodwill, intangible assets, fixed assets, capitalized software and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. These fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company's investments accounted for under the cost method totaled   $3.0 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, and are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an impairment charge of   $1.5 million   related to the write-down of a cost method investment to its estimated fair value of   zero  . The decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary due to the investee company s inability to continue operations without new outside financing. The impairment charge is included in  Other (income) expense, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   
  3. Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $229.8 million   and   $224.4 million   of goodwill, respectively. The additions to goodwill and other intangibles relate to the Company s acquisition of Verilume, Inc., a cloud infrastructure company. The Company completed the purchase price allocation related to this transaction and recorded the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their estimated fair values.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , other intangibles consisted of the following:   

  At   December 31, 2015  , other intangibles consisted of the following:

5. Capitalized Software 
  Capitalized software consisted of the following: 

Amortization expense is classified in each of the operating expense categories as follows: 

6. Income Tax 
  The Company recorded an income tax expense of   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million   despite a pre-tax loss of   $0.5 million   and   $12.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and recorded an income tax expense of   $0.4 million   and   $1.2 million   despite a pre-tax loss of   $6.1 million   and   $23.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily because the income tax benefit related to the U.S. pre-tax loss generated was subject to a valuation allowance. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions generated pre-tax income that resulted in tax expense. 
  The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities in the area of income tax. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service recently completed an audit of the Company s federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. Various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years. Management believes it has adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions and any potential audit adjustments would not have a material impact on the Company s liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. 
  Unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $6.8 million   and   $5.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Management does not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months. If unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016   are subsequently recognized, the Company's income tax expense would be reduced by   $5.7 million   (  $0.7 million   net of the impact of the Company s valuation allowance).

7. Debt 
  Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Based on available market information, the estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt was   $79.2 million   and   $81.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These fair value measurements were determined using Level 2 observable inputs, as defined in Note 2. The estimated fair value of our facility related to the purchase of equipment ("Equipment Loan Facility") approximates its carrying value at each reporting period. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.9 million   in outstanding letters of credit issued under its Revolving Credit Facility. 
  The Term Loan Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the "Credit Facilities") include covenants that restrict certain activities by the Company, as well as require the Company to comply with certain financial ratios such as a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and a springing Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as these terms are defined in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities. The agreements governing the Credit Facilities also contain other affirmative and negative covenants with which the Company is required to comply. The Term Loan Credit Facility requires partial prepayment of a portion of the principal outstanding in the event that the Company generates Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined under the Term Loan Credit Facility) in excess of a certain threshold. This determination is to be made   90   days following the end of the preceding fiscal year, with any payment, if required, due within   105   days following the end of the preceding fiscal year. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants set forth in the Credit Facilities as of   September 30, 2016   and there was no required prepayment for the   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
   
  8. Employee Stock Plans  
  Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. The Company maintains several stock-based compensation plans, which are more fully described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended December 31, 2015  .  
  Stock-based compensation expense related to all of the Company s stock awards is included in operating expense categories, as follows:

9. Net Loss per Share 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net loss per common share: 

The following outstanding options to purchase common stock, unvested shares of restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive: 

10. Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims, charges, disputes, litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations. The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where it believes an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against the Company, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the Company's liquidity, results of operations or financial condition, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. These matters, if resolved adversely against the Company, may result in monetary

damages, fines and penalties or require changes in business practices. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the Company's liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.  
  The Company is not currently aware of any pending or threatened material claims, charges, disputes, litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations. 
   
  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.  Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to our operations and are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections. Words such as  may,   will,   could,   would,   should,   anticipate,   predict,   potential,   continue,   expects,   intends,   plans,   projects,   believes,   estimates,   goals,   in our view  and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report include, but are not limited to, statements about our internal control over financial reporting, our results of operations and financial condition and our plans, strategies and developments. Forward-looking statements are only predictions and, as such, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events or our future financial performance that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. Many of the reasons for these differences include changes that occur in our continually changing business environment and other important factors. These risks, uncertainties and other factors are more fully described in this section and under the heading "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 4, 2016. You are strongly encouraged to read those sections carefully as the occurrence of the events described therein and elsewhere in this report could materially harm our business. Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth Consolidated Statements of Operations data as a percentage of revenue. 

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
   
  Revenue 

Total revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   8.4%   and   6.9%  , or   9.1%   and   8.3%   excluding the effects of foreign exchange, from   2015   to   2016  , respectively. 
  M A revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   10.3%   and   7.7%  , or   11.1%   and   9.3%   excluding the effects of foreign exchange, from   2015   to   2016  , respectively. The growth in M A revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was largely driven by a higher volume of strategic business transactions.  
  Enterprise revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   8.0%   and   8.5%  , or   8.9%   and   9.8%   excluding the effects of foreign exchange, from   2015   to   2016  , respectively. The growth in Enterprise revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in the number of enterprise customers year-over-year and revenue expansion within the existing customer base.  
  DCM revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   remained comparable to   2015   with a decrease of   0.3%   and   2.4%   as reported and excluding the effects of foreign exchange from   2015   to   2016  , respectively.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 

Cost of revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was comparable to   2015  .  
  Cost of revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $1.8 million  , or   3.2%  , from   2015   to   2016  , primarily due increases in employee compensation and related expenses and higher software license and maintenance and hosting fees to support continued customer growth and investments in our platform. 
   
  Operating Expenses 

Sales and marketing expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $3.4 million   and   $4.6 million  , or   11.5%   and   5.0%  , from   2015   to   2016  , respectively, largely due to an increase in headcount as we continue to expand our sales capacity, partially offset by decreases in marketing expense and commissions to third-party partners primarily due to an initiative to expand our internal renewals department, which was previously primarily outsourced.  
  General and administrative expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $3.0 million   and   $4.6 million  , or   16.3%   and   8.3%  , from   2015   to   2016  , respectively, primarily due to management's focus on reducing our overall general and administrative expenses. In addition, stock-based compensation expense decreased   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to awards granted to key employees in prior years that became fully vested during the   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
  Product development expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was comparable to   2015  . The increase in product development expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $1.7 million  , or   9.0%  , from   2015   to   2016  , consisted of an increase in employee compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of employee compensation and related expenses that were capitalized during the period, as well as a decrease in third-party labor expenses.  
  Total product development costs comprise product development expense and capitalized software, including capitalized interest. 

The decrease in total product development costs for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   of   $0.6 million  , or   4.6%  , was driven primarily by a decrease in third-party labor costs, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and related expenses due to an increase in headcount. The increase in total product development costs for the   nine months ended September

     Table of Contents  

30, 2016   of   $1.0 million  , or   2.7%  , from   2015   to   2016   was driven primarily by an increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease in third-party labor costs.  
   
  Non-Operating Expenses 

Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were comparable to   2015  . 
  Other (income) expense, net comprises impairment charges, foreign currency transaction (gains) losses and interest income. Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses largely relate to the remeasurement of Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated accounts receivable held by entities where the Euro or British Pound Sterling is not the functional currency. Net foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were   $(0.1)   and   $(0.5)   and   $0.2   and   $1.1   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of   $1.5 million   related to the write-down of a cost method investment to its estimated fair value of zero due to the investee company's inability to continue operations without new outside financing. 
   
  Income Tax Expense  

We recorded an income tax expense of   $0.7 million   and   $1.5 million   despite a pre-tax loss of   $0.5 million   and   $12.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and recorded an income tax expense of   $0.4 million   and   $1.2 million   despite a pre-tax loss of   $6.1 million   and   $23.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively,   primarily because the income tax benefit related to the U.S. pre-tax loss generated was subject to a valuation allowance. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions generated pre-tax income that resulted in tax expense.  
  We have a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets as we currently believe the assets will not be recoverable. Given expected improvements in business performance and other potential actions it is possible we could conclude in the near future that a valuation allowance will no longer be required. If we were to release the valuation allowance in the future, the current estimate of the GAAP income tax benefit that would be recognized could be as much as $26 million. 
   
  Business Measurements 
  We believe annualized recurring revenue ("ARR") and non-GAAP adjusted operating income are key business measurements as we use them internally to help us evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, establish budgets, assess operational efficiencies, make strategic decisions and compensate our management. 
  ARR growth represents the percentage increase in the value attributable to all of our renewable subscription contracts for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis as compared to the same date in the prior year. ARR is calculated as the annualized value of all renewable subscription contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. ARR growth at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   6%   year-over-year, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. 
  Non-GAAP adjusted operating income represents the corresponding GAAP measure adjusted to exclude, if applicable: (1) amortization of intangible assets, (2) stock-based compensation expense and (3) impairment charges or asset write-offs. The table below provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP income (loss) from operations to non-GAAP adjusted operating income: 
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

We report non-GAAP adjusted operating income as a supplemental measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP or U.S. GAAP. Our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the definition used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to our U.S. GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of this non-GAAP financial measure by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence.   
  Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides useful information about our period-over-period growth and provides additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance. Management also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides a more meaningful comparison of our operating results against those of other companies in our industry, as well as on a period-over-period basis, because this measure excludes items that are not representative of our operating performance, such as amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense.  
   
  Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flows 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $27.1 million   as a result of   $35.3 million   in cash generated from results of operations after adjusting for non-cash items, partially offset by a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of   $8.3 million  . The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase of   $4.6 million   in accounts receivable, primarily related to timing of cash collections, a decrease of   $4.4 million   in accounts payable related to timing of payments and a decrease of   $3.1 million   in accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily related to payment of bonus and commissions related to 2015, partially offset by an increase of   $3.5 million   in deferred revenue. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of a net loss of   $14.1 million   plus adjustments for non-cash items of   $49.4 million   including (a) depreciation and amortization of   $19.5 million  , (b) amortization of intangible assets of   $18.1 million  , (c) stock-based compensation expense of   $8.3 million   and (d) an impairment charge of   $1.5 million   related to the write-down of a cost method investment to its fair value of zero.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $22.2 million   as a result of   $25.9 million   in cash generated from results of operations after adjusting for non-cash items, partially offset by a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of   $3.7 million  . The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase of   $7.4 million   in accounts receivable, primarily related to the timing of cash collections, partially offset by an increase of   $3.6 million   in deferred revenue. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of a net loss of   $24.4 million  , plus adjustments for non-cash items of   $50.3 million   including (a) depreciation and amortization of   $20.2 million  , (b) amortization of intangible assets of   $18.0 million   and (c) stock-based compensation expense of   $8.9 million  . 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $14.5 million   and   $23.4 million  , respectively. Investments in capitalized software development costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $19.1 million   and   $18.6 million  , respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million   compared to   $10.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was primarily related to infrastructure projects. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , maturities of investments, comprising corporate securities, were   $12.4 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we used   $6.3 million   in cash for the acquisition of Verilume, Inc. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we purchased a minority interest in a privately held company for   $1.0 million  , which is accounted for under the cost method.  
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $13.0 million   includes   $11.5 million   for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of $8.13 per share and   $1.7 million   of debt repayments.  
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $1.3 million   includes   $2.7 million   related to the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock, a   $0.5 million   payment of a holdback related to the acquisition of docTrackr, Inc. and   $0.2 million   of repayments of outstanding financing arrangements recorded in "Other, net" financing activities, partially offset by   $0.6 million   of debt repayments. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as the cash flows we generate from operations. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $47.9 million   in cash and cash equivalents and   $53.1 million   in accounts receivable, net of allowances. We have a   $15.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility, which expires on February 24, 2019, and is available as an additional source of financing. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.9 million   in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  On February 19, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $20 million   of shares of our common stock. We may purchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors management deems relevant at any particular time, including without limitation, market conditions, share price, future outlook and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. For detailed information on our share repurchase activity, see Part II, Item 2 - "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and principal payments on long-term debt, for at least the next twelve months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our services. In addition, we may make acquisitions and strategic investments or increase our capital expenditures that could reduce our cash and cash equivalents balances and as a result, we may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility to fund these activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. 
  The Term Loan Credit Facility requires us to comply with a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Facility) that must be less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00. The calculation of our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio permits us to net from our outstanding total indebtedness up to $20.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents. The Term Loan Credit Facility also requires partial prepayment of a portion of the principal outstanding in the event that we generate Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined under the Term Loan Credit Facility) in excess of a certain threshold. If required, the prepayment is equal to 50% of our excess cash flow as measured on an annual basis, with step-downs to 25% and to 0% of our excess cash flow if our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Facility), is less than 2.00 to 1.00 and 1.00 to 1.00, respectively. Excess cash flow is generally defined as our adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Facility) less debt service costs, unfinanced capital expenditures, unfinanced acquisition expenditures, and current income taxes paid, as adjusted for changes in our working capital. This determination is to be made 90 days following the end of the preceding fiscal year, with any payment, if required, due within 105 days following the end of the preceding fiscal year. Additionally, the Term Loan Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayment of the term loans from the net proceeds of certain asset sales outside the ordinary course of business and  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

from proceeds of property insurance and condemnation events, in each case subject to our right to reinvest those proceeds in assets used in our business. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a springing Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), which we must comply with any time our cash and cash equivalents held in deposit or securities accounts subject to a lien in favor of our revolving loan lenders falls below $10.0 million or if an Event of Default (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) occurs, in either case, a "Fixed Charge Coverage Trigger Event." In the event a Fixed Charge Coverage Trigger Event occurs, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio must be greater than or equal to 1.10 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants at   September 30, 2016   and there was no required prepayment for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The agreements governing our Credit Facilities include the following customary restrictions on certain activities, which are subject to lender approval, with certain exceptions: (i) incurring additional indebtedness other than in the normal course of business; (ii) creating liens or other encumbrances on our assets; (iii) engaging in merger or acquisition transactions; (iv) making investments; and (v) entering into asset sale agreements or paying dividends, making distributions on or repurchasing our stock. 
  The agreements governing our Credit Facilities also contain customary events of default, including, but not limited to, uncured cross-defaults among these agreements. In addition, an uncured default under our facility related to the purchase of equipment ("Equipment Loan Facility") would result in a cross-default under our Term Loan Credit Facility and our Revolving Credit Facility. Although we currently expect to remain in compliance with these existing covenants, any breach of these covenants or a change in control could result in a default and subsequent cross-defaults, under our credit agreements, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments from our lenders to extend further credit. 
  Each of our Credit Facilities is secured by liens on substantially all our assets, including a pledge of 100% of the equity interests in our domestic subsidiaries and an obligation to pledge 65% of the equity interests in our direct foreign subsidiaries. Our Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on our cash, accounts receivable and certain other liquid collateral and a second lien on our other assets. Our Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by a second lien on our cash, accounts receivable and certain other liquid collateral and a first lien on our other assets. Our Equipment Loan Facility is secured by liens on the equipment financed under that facility. 
  All obligations under each of our Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. These guarantees are secured by substantially all the present and future property of the guarantors. 
  Our corporate credit ratings and rating agency outlooks as of   September 30, 2016   are summarized in the table below.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements since the disclosure included in Part II, Item 7.  "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" included in Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (a) allowances for doubtful accounts and reserves for customer credits, (b) the fair values of our single operating segment and reporting unit, goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets and long-term investments, (c) the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets, capitalized software and fixed assets (and their related useful lives), (d) certain components of the income tax provision (including the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and liabilities for uncertain tax positions), (e) accruals for certain compensation and benefit expenses and (f) the fair value of stock-based awards including estimated forfeitures of such awards. We base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, forecasts and budgets and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risk since the disclosure included in Part II, Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended December 31, 2015  . 
   
  ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management believes that the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with GAAP, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have certified that they fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented in this report.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

INTRALINKS HOLDINGS, INC. 
     SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 2010 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
  The purpose of the Second Amended and Restated Intralinks Holdings, Inc. 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the    Plan   ) is to provide eligible employees of Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (the    Company   ) and each Designated Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11) with opportunities to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share (the    Common Stock   ).  Two million (2,000,000) shares of Common Stock in the aggregate have been approved and reserved for this purpose.  The Plan is intended to constitute an  employee stock purchase plan  within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and shall be interpreted in accordance with that intent. 
  1.      Administration  .  The Plan will be administered by the person or persons (the    Administrator   ) appointed by the Company s Board of Directors (the    Board   ) for such purpose.  The Administrator has authority at any time to: (i) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and practices for the administration of the Plan and for its own acts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable; (ii) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan; (iii) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan; (iv) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan; and (v) otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.  All interpretations and decisions of the Administrator shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the Participants.  No member of the Board or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any option granted hereunder. 
  2.      Offerings  .  The Company will make one or more offerings to eligible employees to purchase Common Stock under the Plan (   Offerings   ).  Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, the initial Offering will begin on the date of the Company s Initial Public Offering and will end on the later of: (a) December 31, 2010, or (b) the last day of the calendar quarter occurring at least 30 days after the date of the Initial Public Offering (the    Initial Offering   ).  Thereafter, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, an Offering will begin on the first business day occurring on or after each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 and will end on the last business day occurring on or before the following March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, respectively.  The Administrator may, in its discretion, designate a different period for any Offering,   provided   that no Offering shall exceed six months     in duration or overlap any other Offering. 
         3.      Eligibility  .  Each individual classified as an employee on the payroll records of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary and whose customary employment is more than 20 hours a week is eligible to participate in any one or more of the Offerings under the Plan, such eligibility commencing with the individual s first day of employment with the Company or a Designated Subsidiary,   provided   that such employment commencement date is prior to the first day of the calendar month in which an enrollment window occurs.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of the Company s or applicable Designated Subsidiary s payroll system are not considered to be eligible employees of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary and shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan.  In the event any such individuals are reclassified as employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for any purpose, including, without limitation, common law or statutory employees, by any action of any third party, including, without limitation, any government agency, or as a result of any private lawsuit, action or administrative proceeding, such individuals shall, notwithstanding such reclassification, remain ineligible for participation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive means for individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on the Company s or Designated Subsidiary s payroll system to become eligible to participate in this Plan is through an amendment to this Plan, duly executed by the Company, which specifically renders such individuals eligible to participate herein. 
         4.      Participation  . 
  (a)             Participants on Effective Date  .  Each eligible employee at the time of the Initial Public Offering shall be deemed to be a Participant at such time.  If an eligible employee is deemed to be a Participant pursuant to this Section 4(a), such individual shall be deemed not to have authorized payroll deductions and shall not purchase any Common Stock hereunder unless he or she thereafter authorizes payroll deductions by submitting an enrollment form (in the manner described in Section 4(c)) by November 30, 2010, or such other deadline as the Administrator may set with respect to the Initial Offering.  If such a Participant does not authorize payroll deductions by submitting an enrollment form prior to the deadline for the Initial Offering, that Participant will be deemed to have waived the right to participate. 
  (b)             Participants in Subsequent Offerings  .  An eligible employee who has not participated in the Initial Offering or subsequent Offerings may elect to be a Participant in any new Offering by completing the enrollment form made available through the Company s equity plan administrator within the period beginning 30 days prior to the relevant Offering Date and ending 15 days before the relevant Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering) (such periods referred to as    Enrollment Windows   ). 
  (c)             Enrollment  .  The enrollment form will (a) state the amount to be deducted from an eligible employee s Compensation (as defined in Section 11) per pay period, (b) authorize the purchase of Common Stock in each Offering in accordance with the terms of the Plan and (c) specify the exact name or names in which shares of Common Stock purchased for such individual are to be issued pursuant to Section 10.  An employee who does not enroll in accordance with these procedures will be deemed to have waived the right to participate.  Unless a Participant files a new enrollment form or withdraws from the Plan, such Participant s deductions and purchases will continue at the same percentage of Compensation for future Offerings,   provided   he or she remains eligible. 
             (d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, participation in the Plan will neither be permitted nor be denied contrary to the requirements of the Code. 
  5.      Employee Contributions  .  Each eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at a minimum of 10 dollars ($10) per pay period up to a maximum of 10% of such employee s Compensation for each pay period.  The Company will maintain book accounts showing the amount of payroll deductions made by each Participant for each Offering.  No interest will accrue or be paid on payroll deductions. 
  6.      Deduction Changes  .  Except in the event of a Participant increasing his or her payroll deduction from 0 percent during the Initial Offering as specified in Section 4(a) or as may be determined by the Administrator in advance of an Offering, a Participant may not increase or decrease his or her payroll deduction during any Offering, but may increase or decrease his or her payroll deduction with respect to the next Offering (subject to the limitations of Section 5) by filing a new enrollment form during the Enrollment Window prior to the relevant Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering).  The Administrator may, in advance of any Offering, establish rules permitting a Participant to increase, decrease or terminate his or her payroll deduction during an Offering. 
         7.      Withdrawal  .  A Participant may withdraw from participation in any Offering under the Plan by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to his or her appropriate payroll location no later than the 20   th    day prior to the Exercise Date.  The Participant s withdrawal will be effective as of the next business day.  Following a Participant s withdrawal, the Company will promptly refund such individual s entire account balance under the Plan to him or her.  Partial withdrawals are not permitted.  Such an employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Offering, but may enroll in a subsequent Offering in accordance with Section 4. 
  8.      Grant of Options  .  On the first trading day of each Offering, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a Participant in the Plan an option (   Option   ) to purchase on the Exercise Date, at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, (a) a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant s accumulated payroll deductions on such Exercise Date by the Option Price (as defined herein); (b) 5,000 shares; or such other maximum number of shares as shall have been established by the Administrator in advance of the Offering, whichever is lowest;   provided  ,   however  , that such Option shall be subject to the limitations set forth below.  Each Participant's Option shall be exercisable only to the extent of such Participant s accumulated payroll deductions on the Exercise Date.  The purchase price for each share purchased under each Option (the    Option Price   ) will be 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the first trading day of the Offering or Exercise Date, whichever is less. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant may be granted an option hereunder if such Participant, immediately after the option was granted, would be treated as owning stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership of a Participant, and all stock which the Participant has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the Participant.  In addition, no Participant may be granted an Option that permits his or her rights to purchase stock under the Plan, and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company and its Parents and Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of such stock (determined on the option grant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time.  The purpose of the limitation in the preceding sentence is to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and shall be applied taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. 
  9.      Exercise of Option and Purchase of Shares  .  Each employee who continues to be a Participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option on such date and shall acquire from the Company such number of whole shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan as his or her accumulated payroll deductions on such date will purchase at the Option Price, subject to any other limitations contained in the Plan.  Any amount remaining in a Participant's account at the end of an Offering solely by reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share will be carried forward to the next Offering; any other balance remaining in a Participant s account at the end of an Offering will be refunded to the Participant promptly. 
  10.      Issuance of Certificates  .  Certificates representing shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be issued only in the name of the employee, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, or in the name of a broker authorized by the employee to be his, her or their, nominee for such purpose. 
  11.      Definitions  . 
  The term    Compensation    means the amount of base pay, prior to salary reduction pursuant to Sections 125, 132(f) or 401(k) of the Code.  All other forms of compensation shall be excluded. 
  The term    Designated Subsidiary    means any present or future Subsidiary (as defined below) that has been designated by the Board to participate in the Plan.  The Board may so designate any Subsidiary, or revoke any such designation, at any time and from time to time, either before or after the Plan is approved by the stockholders. The current list of Designated Subsidiaries is attached hereto as   Appendix A  . 
  The term    Exercise Date    means the last business day of an Offering. 
  The term    Fair Market Value of the Common Stock    on any given date means the fair market value of the Common Stock determined in good faith by the Administrator;   provided  ,   however  , that if the Common Stock is admitted to quotation on the New York Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange, the determination shall be made by reference to the closing price on such securities exchange.  If there is no closing price for such date, the determination shall be made by reference to the last date preceding such date for which there is a closing price.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date for which Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is determined is the first day when trading prices for the Common Stock are reported on the New York Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange, the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock shall be the    Price to the Public    (or equivalent) set forth on the cover page for the final prospectus relating to the Company s Initial Public Offering. 
  The term    Initial Public Offering    means the consummation of the first fully underwritten, firm commitment public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale by the Company of its Common Stock. 
  The term    Offering Date    means the first day of a quarterly period during which an Offering occurs (e.g., January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1). 
  The term    Parent    means a    parent corporation    with respect to the Company, as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code. 
  The term    Participant    means an individual who is eligible as determined in Section 3 and who has complied with the provisions of Section 4. 
  The term    Subsidiary    means a    subsidiary corporation    with respect to the Company, as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code. 
  12.      Rights on Termination of Employment  .  If a Participant s employment terminates for any reason before the Exercise Date for any Offering, no payroll deduction will be taken from any pay due and owing to the Participant and the balance in the Participant s account will be paid to such Participant or, in the case of such Participant s death, to his or her estate as if such Participant had withdrawn from the Plan under Section 7.  An employee will be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose if the corporation or other entity that employs him or her, having been a Designated Subsidiary, ceases to be a Subsidiary, or if the employee is transferred to any corporation or other entity other than the Company or a Designated Subsidiary.  An employee will not be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose if the employee is on an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee s right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator otherwise provides in writing. 
  13.      Special Rules  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrator may adopt special rules applicable to the employees of a particular Designated Subsidiary whenever the Administrator determines that such rules are necessary or appropriate for the implementation of the Plan in a foreign jurisdiction where such Designated Subsidiary has employees;   provided   that such rules are consistent with the requirements of Section 423(b) of the Code.  Such special rules may include (by way of example, but not by way of limitation) the establishment of a method for employees of a given Designated Subsidiary to fund the purchase of shares other than by payroll deduction, if the payroll deduction method is prohibited by local law or is otherwise impracticable.  Any special rules established pursuant to this Section 13 shall, to the extent possible, result in the employees subject to such rules having substantially the same rights as other Participants in the Plan.  Any grant of Options to employees of a Designated Subsidiary under this Section 13 shall be viewed as a separate offering under Section 423 of the Code. 
  14.      Optionees Not Stockholders  .  Neither the granting of an Option to a Participant nor the deductions from his or her pay shall constitute such Participant a holder of the shares of Common Stock covered by an Option under the Plan until such shares have been purchased by and issued to him or her. 
  15.      Rights Not Transferable  .  Rights under the Plan are not transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and are exercisable during the Participant s lifetime only by the Participant. 
  16.      Application of Funds  .  All funds received or held by the Company under the Plan may be combined with other corporate funds and may be used for any corporate purpose. 
  17.      Adjustment in Case of Changes Affecting Common Stock  .  In the event of a subdivision of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the payment of a dividend in Common Stock or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the number of shares approved for the Plan and the share limitation set forth in Section 8 shall be equitably or proportionately adjusted to give proper effect to such event. 
  18.      Amendment of the Plan  .  The Board may at any time and from time to time amend the Plan in any respect, except that without the approval within 12 months of such Board action by the stockholders, no amendment shall be made increasing the number of shares approved for the Plan or making any other change that would require stockholder approval in order for the Plan, as amended, to qualify as an  employee stock purchase plan  under Section 423(b) of the Code. 
  19.      Insufficient Shares  .  If the total number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be purchased on any Exercise Date plus the number of shares purchased under previous Offerings under the Plan exceeds the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan, the shares then available shall be apportioned among Participants in proportion to the amount of payroll deductions accumulated on behalf of each Participant that would otherwise be used to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date. 
  20.      Termination of the Plan  .  The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board.  Upon termination of the Plan, all amounts in the accounts of Participants shall be promptly refunded. 
  21.      Governmental Regulations  .  The Company s obligation to sell and deliver Common Stock under the Plan is subject to obtaining all governmental approvals required in connection with the authorization, issuance, or sale of such stock. 
  22.      Governing Law  .  This Plan and all Options and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applied without regard to conflict of law principles. 
  23.      Issuance of Shares  .  Shares may be issued upon exercise of an Option from authorized but unissued Common Stock, from shares held in the treasury of the Company, or from any other proper source. 
  24.      Tax Withholding  .  Participation in the Plan is subject to any minimum required tax withholding on income of the Participant in connection with the Plan.  Each Participant agrees, by entering the Plan, that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant, including shares issuable under the Plan. 
  25.      Notification upon Sale of Shares  .  Each Participant agrees, by entering the Plan, to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares purchased under the Plan where such disposition occurs within two years after the date of grant of the Option pursuant to which such shares were purchased. 
  26.      Effective Date and Approval of Shareholders  .  This Plan originally took effect on August 6, 2010.   The Board approved the second amended and restated Plan on April 26, 2016.  The second amended and restated Plan shall, in accordance with applicable law, the Company s by-laws and certificate of incorporation, become effective upon approval by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present.
