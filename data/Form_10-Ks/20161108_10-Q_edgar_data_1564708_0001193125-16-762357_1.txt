     NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION       News Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  News Corporation,   News Corp,  the  Company,   we,  or  us ) is a global diversified media and
information services company comprised of businesses across a range of media, including: news and information services, book publishing, digital real estate services, cable network programming in Australia and pay-TV distribution in Australia.
     During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management approved a plan to dispose of the Company s digital education business. As a
result of the plan and the discontinuation of further significant business activities in the Digital Education segment, the assets and liabilities of this segment were classified as held for sale and the results of operations have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to the Company s continuing operations. (See Note 3 Discontinued Operations).
       Basis of Presentation     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company, which are referred to herein as the  Consolidated Financial
Statements,  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating results for the interim period presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not exercise control and is not the primary beneficiary are
accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are designated as available-for-sale if readily determinable fair values are available. If an
investment s fair value is not readily determinable, the Company accounts for its investment under the cost method.      The consolidated
statements of operations are referred to herein as the  Statements of Operations.  The consolidated balance sheets are referred to herein as the  Balance Sheets.  The consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein
as the  Statements of Cash Flows.       The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
on August 12, 2016 (the  2016 Form 10-K ).      Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reclassified its listing revenues generated primarily from agents, brokers and developers from advertising revenue to real estate
revenue to better reflect the Company s revenue mix and how management reviews the performance of the Digital Real Estate Services segment.      The Company s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to June 30. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 include 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. All references to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 relate to the three months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. For convenience purposes, the Company continues to date its consolidated financial statements as of September 30.

NEWS CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   
     Recently issued accounting pronouncements     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 removes inconsistencies and differences in existing revenue requirements between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) and requires a
company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Once effective, ASU 2014-09 can
be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify aspects
relating to the identification of performance obligations and improve the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Update 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-12 address certain issues identified on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash
consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The effective date for all ASUs noted above is annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact these ASUs
will have on its consolidated financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ( ASU 2015-05 ). ASU 2015-05 clarifies guidance about whether a customer s cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud
computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU was adopted on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into, or materially modified beginning July 1,
2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-01 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.      In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ).
The amendments in ASU 2016-02 address certain aspects in lease accounting, with the most significant impact for lessees. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 require lessees to recognize all leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and
a lease liability, and lessor accounting has been updated to align with the new requirements for lessees. The new standard also provides changes to the existing sale-leaseback guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning July 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.      In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The amendments
in ASU   
         6   

Table of Contents  

NEWS CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

2016-09 address several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated
financial statements.      In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be
collected. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.   
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a
consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.       NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS
AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS         Fiscal 2017         Wireless Group plc       In September 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Wireless
Group plc ( Wireless Group ) for a purchase price of 315 pence per share in cash, or approximately  220 million (approximately $285 million) in the aggregate, plus $23 million of assumed debt which was repaid subsequent to
closing. Wireless Group operates talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K., and a portfolio of radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland. The acquisition broadens the Company s range of services in the U.K., Ireland and
internationally, and the Company expects to closely align Wireless Group s operations with those of  The Sun  and  The Times . The Company utilized the restricted cash which was specifically set aside at June 30, 2016 for purposes of
funding the acquisition and therefore the Company has no restricted cash as of September 30, 2016.     The total transaction value for the
Wireless Group acquisition is set forth below (in millions):       
    Under the purchase method of accounting, the total consideration is allocated to net tangible and intangible assets based
upon the fair value as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the total consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The acquired intangible assets of
approximately $193 million primarily relate to broadcast licenses which have an indefinite life. The Company recorded approximately $149 million of goodwill on the transaction. The values assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities are based on
preliminary estimates of fair value available as of the date of this filing and may be adjusted upon completion of final valuations of certain assets and liabilities. Any changes in   
         7

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  The Company s investments were comprised of the following:       

(a)   
        The change in the
Foxtel investment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.      

(b)   
        In May 2012,
Foxtel purchased Austar United Communications Ltd. The transaction was funded by Foxtel bank debt and pro rata capital contributions made by Foxtel shareholders in the form of subordinated shareholder notes based on their respective ownership
interests. The Company s share of the subordinated shareholder notes was approximately A$451 million ($346 million and $338 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively). The subordinated shareholder notes can be repaid
beginning in July 2022 provided that Foxtel s senior debt has been repaid. The subordinated shareholder notes have a maturity

date of July 15, 2027, with interest payable on June 30 each year and at maturity. On June 22, 2016, Foxtel and Foxtel s shareholders agreed to modify the terms of the loan
receivable to reduce the interest rate from 12% to 10.5%, to more closely align with current market rates. Upon maturity, the principal advanced will be repayable.      

(c)   
        Available-for-sale
securities primarily include the Company s investments in APN and The Rubicon Project, Inc. During fiscal 2016, the Company participated in an entitlement offer to maintain its 14.99% interest in APN for $20 million. APN operates a portfolio of
Australian radio and outdoor media assets.      

(d)   
        Cost method
investments primarily include the Company s investment in SEEKAsia Limited and certain investments in China.        The
Company measures the fair market values of available-for-sale investments as Level 1 financial instruments under ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement,  as such investments have quoted prices in active markets. The cost basis, unrealized gains,
unrealized losses and fair market value of available-for-sale investments are set forth below:       
     Equity (Losses) Earnings of Affiliates       The Company s share of the (losses) earnings of its equity affiliates was as follows:       

(a)   
        In accordance with
ASC 350, the Company amortized $19 million and $12 million, respectively, related to excess cost over the Company s proportionate share of its investment s underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Such amortization is reflected in Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the Statements of Operations. The increase in amortization expense recognized by the Company in the current year period was offset
by a corresponding decrease in amortization expense recognized by Foxtel as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2016.

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   
   Summarized financial information for Foxtel, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, was as follows:

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Foxtel s revenues increased
$31 million, or 5%, primarily as a result of the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations as revenues increased modestly in local currency. Operating income increased primarily due to higher revenues as noted above, lower depreciation and
amortization expense and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher programming spend. Net income decreased mainly due to the $21 million loss resulting from Foxtel management s decision to cease Presto
operations in January 2017.       NOTE 6. BORROWINGS       The Company s total borrowings consist of the following:       
      REA Group Unsecured Revolving Loan Facility        REA Group entered into a A$480 million unsecured syndicated revolving loan facility agreement in connection with the acquisition of iProperty. The REA Facility consists of three sub facilities of A$120
million, A$120 million and A$240 million which become due in December 2017, December 2018 and December 2019, respectively. In February 2016, REA Group drew down the full A$480 million (approximately $340 million as of such date) available under the
REA Facility, and the proceeds, less lenders  fees of $1 million, were used to fund the iProperty acquisition. Borrowings under the REA Facility bear interest at a floating rate of the Australian BBSY plus a margin in the range of 0.85% and
1.45% depending on REA Group s net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, REA Group was paying a margin of between 0.90% and 1.10%. REA Group paid approximately $3 million in interest for the three months ended September 30, 2016 at a
weighted average interest rate of 2.9%. The REA Facility requires REA Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of not more than   
         13   

Table of Contents  

NEWS CORPORATION    
   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2016, REA Group was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.   
    Revolving Credit Facility        The
Company s Credit Agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) provides for an unsecured $650 million revolving credit facility (the  Facility ) that can be used for general corporate purposes. The Facility has a sublimit
of $100 million available for issuances of letters of credit. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request increases in the amount of the Facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million.  
  In October 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Amendment ) which, among other things, extended the
original term of the Facility by two years and lowered the commitment fee payable by the Company. As a result of the Amendment, the lenders  commitments now terminate on October 23, 2020, and any borrowings will be due at that time.
The Company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the Credit Agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.      The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, with customary exceptions, including limitations on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to
engage in transactions with affiliates, incur liens, merge into or consolidate with any other entity, incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries. In
addition, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. If any of the events of default occur and are not
cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
     Interest on borrowings under the Facility is based on either (a) a Eurodollar Rate formula or (b) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in
the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the Credit Agreement, which varies based on the Company s adjusted operating income leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was
paying a commitment fee of 0.225% on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 0.50% for a Base Rate borrowing and 1.50% for a Eurodollar Rate borrowing.      As of the date of this filing, the Company has not borrowed any funds under the Facility.

approximately $429 million. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committee s decisions regarding future stock
repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Company s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements,
regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and
the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.       Dividends    
  In August 2016, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. This
dividend was paid on October 19, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 14, 2016. The following table summarizes the dividends declared per share on both the Company s Class A Common Stock and the Class B
Common Stock:

Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed below. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often
cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with
the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.

   The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both
probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for
which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. Except as otherwise provided below, for the contingencies
disclosed for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or
realizable.       News America Marketing        In-Store Marketing and FSI Purchasers       On February 29, 2016, the parties agreed to settle
the litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in which The Dial Corporation, Henkel Consumer Goods, Inc., H.J. Heinz Company, H.J. Heinz Company, L.P., Foster Poultry Farms, Smithfield Foods, Inc., HP Hood LLC and
BEF Foods, Inc. alleged various claims under federal and state antitrust law against News Corporation, News America Incorporated ( NAI ), News America Marketing FSI L.L.C. ( NAM FSI ) and News America Marketing In-Store
Services L.L.C. ( NAM In-Store Services  and, together with News Corporation, NAI and NAM FSI, the  NAM Group ). Under the terms of the settlement, the NAM Group agreed, among other things, to pay the plaintiffs and their
attorneys approximately $250 million, and the parties agreed to dismiss the litigation with prejudice. As required under the settlement agreement, the NAM Group delivered the proposed settlement amount into escrow during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, to be held pending District Court approval. On October 31, 2016, the District Court approved the settlement, and the settlement payment will be released to the plaintiffs and their attorneys. The NAM Group also settled related
claims for approximately $30 million in February 2016.       Valassis Communications, Inc.    
  On November 8, 2013, Valassis Communications, Inc. ( Valassis ) initiated legal proceedings against certain of the Company s
subsidiaries alleging violations of various antitrust laws. These proceedings are described in further detail below.       

Valassis previously initiated an action against NAI, NAM FSI and NAM In-Store Services (collectively, the  NAM Parties ), captioned Valassis
Communications, Inc. v. News America Incorporated, et al., No. 2:06-cv-10240 (E.D. Mich.) ( Valassis I ), alleging violations of federal antitrust laws, which was settled in February 2010. On November 8, 2013, Valassis filed a
motion for expedited discovery in the previously settled case based on its belief that defendants had engaged in activities prohibited under an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in connection with the
parties  settlement, which motion was granted by the magistrate judge.         Valassis subsequently filed a
Notice of Violation of the order issued by the District Court in Valassis I. The Notice contained allegations that were substantially similar to the allegations Valassis made in Valassis II, described below, and sought treble damages, injunctive
relief and attorneys  fees. The Notice also re-asserted claims of unlawful bundling and tying which the magistrate judge had previously recommended be dismissed from Valassis II on the grounds that such claims could only be brought before a
panel of antitrust experts previously appointed in Valassis I (the  Antitrust Expert Panel ). On March 2, 2015, the NAM Parties filed a motion to refer the Notice to the Antitrust Expert Panel or, in the alternative, strike the
Notice. The District Court granted the NAM Parties  motion in part on March

proceedings before the Antitrust Expert Panel.       

On November 8, 2013, Valassis also filed a new complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the NAM Group
alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and common law business torts ( Valassis II ). The complaint sought treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys  fees and costs. On December 19, 2013, the NAM Group
filed a motion to dismiss the newly filed complaint.         The District Court referred the NAM Group s motion
to dismiss to the magistrate judge for determination, and on July 16, 2014, the magistrate judge recommended that the District Court grant the NAM Group s motion in part with respect to certain claims regarding alleged bundling and tying
conduct and stay the remainder of the action. On March 30, 2016, the District Court adopted in part the magistrate judge s recommendation. The District Court ordered that Valassis s bundling and tying claims be dismissed without prejudice
to Valassis s rights to pursue relief for those claims in Valassis I. The District Court sustained Valassis s objection to the stay of Valassis II, but further ordered that all remaining claims in the NAM Group s motion to dismiss be
referred to the Antitrust Expert Panel. The District Court further ordered that the case be administratively closed and that it may be re-opened following proceedings before the Antitrust Expert Panel.   
  The Antitrust Expert Panel was convened and, on September 24, 2016, issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the NAM Group s motion to
dismiss the Valassis II complaint be denied. The Antitrust Expert Panel also scheduled a preliminary hearing in Valassis I for December 19, 2016 and ordered discovery to be completed by November 2017. While it is not possible at this time to predict
with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of these actions, the NAM Group believes it has been compliant with applicable laws and intends to defend itself vigorously in both actions.       U.K. Newspaper Matters and Related Investigations and Litigation       A purported class action
lawsuit captioned Wilder v. News Corp., et al. was previously filed against 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Rebekah Brooks, Les Hinton and the Company s subsidiary, NI Group Limited (now known as News Corp UK   Ireland
Limited) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all purchasers of 21st Century Fox s common stock between July 8, 2009 and July 18, 2011 for claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, alleging that false and misleading statements were issued regarding alleged acts of voicemail interception at  The News of the World  and seeking compensatory damages, rescission for damages
sustained and costs. On September 30, 2015, the District Court dismissed all of plaintiffs  claims and on September 21, 2016, the District Court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. On October 21, 2016, plaintiffs  time to
appeal the District Court s decision expired, and the case was closed.      In addition, civil claims have been brought against the Company
with respect to, among other things, voicemail interception and inappropriate payments to public officials at the Company s former publication,  The News of the World , and at  The Sun , and related matters (the  U.K. Newspaper
Matters ). The Company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases. The Company also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme which was closed to new claims after April 8, 2013.
     In connection with the Company s separation of its businesses (the  Separation ) from 21st Century Fox on June 28, 2013 (the
 Distribution Date ), the Company and 21st Century Fox agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that 21st Century Fox would indemnify the Company for payments made after the Distribution Date

arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the previously concluded criminal
matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (i) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the Company or 21st Century Fox.
21st Century Fox s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an after-tax basis.      The net expense
related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters in Selling, general and administrative expenses was $2 million and $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has provided for its best
estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred, including liabilities associated with employment taxes, and has accrued approximately $101 million, of which approximately $58 million will be indemnified by 21st
Century Fox, and a corresponding receivable was recorded in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. It is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed
given the information that is currently available to the Company. If more claims are filed and additional information becomes available, the Company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters.   
  The Company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims. It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution
thereof could damage its reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.       Other       The Company s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and
international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, it is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not
currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. As subsidiaries of 21st Century Fox prior to the Separation, the
Company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st Century Fox for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the 21st Century Fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the Company
or any of the Company s domestic subsidiaries were a member of the 21st Century Fox consolidated group. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21st
Century Fox consolidated group. In conjunction with the Separation, the Company entered into the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement with 21st Century Fox, which requires 21st Century Fox to indemnify the Company for any such liability.
Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the IRS or other taxing authorities in amounts that the Company cannot quantify.

    NOTE 11. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS    
  The Company provides pension, postretirement health care, defined contribution and medical benefits primarily in the U.S., U.K. and Australia to the
Company s eligible employees and retirees. The Company funds amounts, at a minimum, in accordance with statutory requirements for all plans. Plan assets consist principally of common stocks, marketable bonds and government securities.
     The amortization of amounts related to unrecognized prior service (credits) and deferred losses were reclassified out of other comprehensive
income as a component of net periodic benefit costs. The components of net periodic benefits costs were as follows:       
    During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company contributed approximately $12 million and $11
million, respectively, to its various pension and postretirement plans.       NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES    
  At the end of each interim period, the Company estimates the annual effective income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary quarterly earnings.
The tax expense or benefit related to significant, unusual or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect and are individually computed are recognized in the interim period in which those items
occur. In addition, the effects of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status are recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.      The Company s effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate, primarily due to non-taxable book gains, which had a greater
impact on the Company s effective tax rate for the quarter due to the Company s low pre-tax book loss.      The Company s effective
income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation
allowances related to certain U.S. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. This benefit was recognized in conjunction with management s plan to dispose of the Company s digital education business as
the Company expects to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration. In addition, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $151 million upon reclassification of the Digital
Education segment to discontinued operations in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Statement of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

   The Company s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax
authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for
the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax
examinations continue to progress.      The Company paid gross income taxes of $34 million and $19 million during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and received income tax refunds of nil and $1 million, respectively.       NOTE 13. SEGMENT

operations in 18 countries and particular strengths in general fiction, nonfiction, children s and religious publishing. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded publishing imprints, including Avon, Harper, HarperCollins Children s Books,
William Morrow, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson, and publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, Patricia Cornwell, Veronica Roth, Rick Warren, Sarah Young and Agatha Christie and popular titles such
as    The Hobbit ,    Goodnight Moon ,    To Kill a Mockingbird, Jesus Calling  and the    Divergent  series.      

Digital Real Estate Services   The Digital Real Estate Services segment consists primarily of the Company s interests in REA
Group and Move. REA Group is a publicly traded company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX: REA) that advertises property and property-related services on websites and mobile applications across Australia, Asia and Europe. REA Group
operates Australia s leading residential and commercial property websites, realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au. The Company holds a 61.6% interest in REA Group.

channels distributed via cable, satellite and IP, several interactive viewing applications and broadcast rights to live sporting events in Australia including: National Rugby League, the domestic
football league, international cricket, Australian Rugby Union and various motorsports programming.          

Other   The Other segment consists primarily of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate Strategy and Creative Group and
costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Company s corporate Strategy and Creative Group was formed to identify new products and services across its businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential
acquisitions, investments and dispositions.         Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses, and selling,
general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other, net, income tax benefit and net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA.   
  Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate
resources within the Company s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company s business segments and its enterprise value
against historical data and competitors  data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).

   NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
   
   Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute
for, net (loss) income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization
and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company s financial performance. The Company believes that information about Total Segment EBITDA allows users of its Consolidated Financial Statements
to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. The following table reconciles
Total Segment EBITDA to income from continuing operations.

doubtful accounts, which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible. In determining the allowance for returns, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of the

ITEM 2.   
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          This document, including the following discussion and analysis, contains statements that constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. The words  expect, 
 estimate,   anticipate,   predict,   believe  and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements appear in a number of places in this
discussion and analysis and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things, trends affecting the Company s financial condition or results
of operations and the outcome of contingencies such as litigation and investigations. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. More information regarding
these risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is set forth under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under the heading  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A in News Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) on August 12, 2016 (the  2016 Form 10-K ). The Company does not ordinarily make projections of its future operating results and undertakes no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review this document and the other documents filed by the Company with the SEC. This
section should be read together with the unaudited consolidated financial statements of News Corporation and related notes set forth elsewhere herein and the 2016 Form 10-K.        INTRODUCTION       News Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  News
Corporation,   News Corp,  the  Company,   we,  or  us ) is a global diversified media and information services company comprised of businesses across a range of media, including: news and information
services, book publishing, digital real estate services, cable network programming in Australia and pay-TV distribution in Australia.      During
the first quarter of fiscal 2016, management approved a plan to dispose of the Company s digital education business. As a result of the plan and the discontinuation of further significant business activities in the Digital Education
segment, the assets and liabilities of this segment were classified as held for sale and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to the Company s continuing operations. (See Note 3 Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).      During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reclassified its listing revenues generated primarily from agents, brokers and developers from advertising revenue to real estate revenue to
better reflect the Company s revenue mix and how management reviews the performance of the Digital Real Estate Services segment.      The
unaudited consolidated financial statements are referred to herein as the  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The consolidated statements of operations are referred to herein as the  Statements of Operations.  The consolidated
balance sheets are referred to herein as the  Balance Sheets.  The consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein as the  Statements of Cash Flows.  The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ).      Management s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows:

Overview of the Company s Business   This section provides a general description of the Company s businesses, as well as
developments that occurred to date during fiscal 2017 and in the three months      
         27

ended September 30, 2015 that the Company believes are important in understanding its financial condition and results of operations or to disclose known trends.      

Results of Operations   This section provides an analysis of the Company s results of operations for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated basis and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that have an impact on the comparability of the results
being analyzed.          

Liquidity and Capital Resources     This section provides an analysis of the Company s cash flows for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as a discussion of the Company s financial arrangements and outstanding commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed during fiscal 2017.      
   OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESSES    
  The Company manages and reports its businesses in the following five segments:   

News and Information     Services   The News and Information Services segment includes the Company s global print,
digital and broadcast radio media platforms. These product offerings include the global print and digital versions of  The Wall Street Journal  and the Dow Jones Media Group, which includes  Barron s  and MarketWatch, as well as the
Company s suite of professional information products, including Factiva, Dow Jones Risk   Compliance, Dow Jones Newswires, Dow Jones PEVC and DJX. The Company also owns, among other publications,    The Australian, The
Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun  and    The Courier-Mail  in Australia , The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun  and    The Sun on Sunday  in the U.K. and the    New York
Post  in the U.S. This segment also includes News America Marketing, a leading provider of home-delivered shopper media, in-store marketing products and services and digital marketing solutions, including Checkout 51 s mobile
application, as well as Unruly, a leading global video advertising distribution platform, and Wireless Group, operator of talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K.      

Book Publishing   The Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world, with
operations in 18 countries and particular strengths in general fiction, nonfiction, children s and religious publishing. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded publishing imprints, including Avon, Harper, HarperCollins Children s Books,
William Morrow, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson, and publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, Patricia Cornwell, Veronica Roth, Rick Warren, Sarah Young and Agatha Christie and popular titles such
as    The Hobbit ,    Goodnight Moon ,    To Kill a Mockingbird, Jesus Calling  and the    Divergent  series.      

Digital Real Estate     Services   The Digital Real Estate Services segment consists primarily of the Company s
interests in REA Group Limited ( REA Group ) and Move, Inc. ( Move ). REA Group is a publicly traded company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ( ASX ) (ASX: REA) that advertises property and property-related
services on websites and mobile applications across Australia, Asia and Europe. REA Group operates Australia s leading residential and commercial property websites, realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au. The Company holds a 61.6% interest
in REA Group.         Move is a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S. and
primarily operates realtor.com     , a premier real estate information and services marketplace. Move also offers a
number of professional software and services products, including Top Producer     , TigerLead      and ListHub   TM   . The Company owns an 80% interest in Move, with the remaining 20% being held by REA Group.   

Cable Network Programming   The Cable Network Programming segment consists of FOX SPORTS Australia, the leading sports programming
provider in Australia, with seven high definition television channels distributed via cable, satellite and IP, several interactive viewing applications and broadcast rights to live sporting events in Australia including: National Rugby League, the
domestic football league, international cricket, Australian Rugby Union and various motorsports programming.      
         28   

Table of Contents  

Other   The Other segment consists primarily of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate Strategy and Creative Group and
costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters (as defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company s corporate Strategy and Creative Group was formed to identify new products and services across its businesses to increase
revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions.          News and
Information Services       Revenue at the News and Information Services segment is derived from the sale of advertising, circulation and
subscriptions, as well as licensing. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues. Advertising revenues at the News and Information Services segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically
being highest in the Company s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. Circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the Company s and/or
competitors  products, as well as by promotional activities.      Operating expenses include costs related to paper, production,
distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions and radio sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.   
  The News and Information Services segment s advertising volume and rates, circulation and the price of paper are the key variables whose
fluctuations can have a material effect on the Company s operating results and cash flow. The Company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume and rates, circulation and paper prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating
profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. The Company continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. Paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. The
Company s expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper. The News and Information Services segment s products compete for readership and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete
with other media alternatives in their respective markets. Competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of these products also depends
upon advertisers  judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. Such judgments are based on factors such as
cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of readership demographics.      The Company s traditional print business
faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. The Company is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move in advertising from print to digital.
These alternative media formats could impact the Company s overall performance, positively or negatively. In addition, technologies have been and will continue to be developed that allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile
devices, which may impact advertising rates or revenues.      As a multi-platform news provider, the Company recognizes the importance of
maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital products. Technologies such as smartphones, tablets and similar devices and
their related applications provide continued opportunities for the Company to make its journalism available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes, and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or
affect the relationship between publisher and consumer. The Company continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms.       Book Publishing       The Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general
fiction, nonfiction, children s and religious books in the U.S. and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing   
         29   

Table of Contents  

segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the
end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. This marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments and other factors. Each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success
depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.      Major new title releases represent a significant portion of the Book Publishing
segment s sales throughout the fiscal year. Print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Book Publishing segment is subject to
global trends and local economic conditions. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors  royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative
expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.       Digital Real Estate Services   
  The Digital Real Estate Services segment generates revenue through the sale of real estate listing products to agents, brokers and developers and display
advertising on its residential real estate and commercial property sites and also licenses certain professional software products on a subscription basis. Significant expenses associated with these sites and software solutions include development
costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.   
  Consumers are increasingly turning to the Internet and mobile devices for real estate information. The Digital Real Estate Services segment s
success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that make its websites and mobile applications useful for consumers and real estate and mortgage professionals and attractive to its advertisers.   
   Cable Network Programming       The Cable
Network Programming segment consists of FOX SPORTS Australia, which offers the following seven channels in high definition: FOX SPORTS 1, FOX SPORTS 2, FOX SPORTS 3, FOX SPORTS 4, FOX SPORTS 5, FOX FOOTY and FOX SPORTS NEWS. Revenue is primarily
derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-tv providers (mainly Foxtel) based on the number of subscribers.      FOX SPORTS Australia
competes primarily with ESPN, beIN SPORTS, the Free-To-Air ( FTA ) channels and certain telecommunications companies in Australia.   
  The most significant operating expenses of the Cable Network Programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and
the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations. The expenses associated with licensing programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the Cable Network
Programming segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the Company s local and international sports programming. Other expenses include marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the
channels and their programming. Additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.       Other
      The Other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, the corporate Strategy and Creative Group and costs related
to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Company s corporate Strategy and Creative Group was formed to identify new products and services across the Company s businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential
acquisitions, investments and dispositions.

     Revenues   Revenues decreased $49 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The revenue decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in revenues at the News and Information Services segment of $68 million, primarily
resulting from weakness in the print advertising market and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and a decrease at the Book Publishing segment of $20 million primarily due to the absence of sales associated with  Go Set a
Watchman  by Harper Lee and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher foreign language publishing revenues. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services
segment of $35 million due to higher revenues at both REA Group and Move. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Revenue decrease of $36 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying current period results by the difference
between the average quarterly exchange rates for the current year period and the average quarterly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior year.        Operating Expenses   Operating expenses decreased $42 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The decrease in
Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in operating expenses at the News and Information Services segment of $41 million, primarily as a result of lower newsprint, production and distribution
costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives, and at the Book Publishing segment of $23 million due to the mix of titles. These decreases were partially offset by increased operating expenses at the Cable Network Programming segment resulting
from the timing of sports programming rights costs and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense decrease of $11
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.        Selling, general and
administrative expenses   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $28 million, or 4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The increase in Selling, general
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due mainly to higher marketing costs at REA Group and Move and at the News and Information
Services segment, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Unruly and Wireless Group. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative expense decrease of
$20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.        Depreciation and
amortization   Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1 million, or 1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased
due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Depreciation and amortization expense decrease of $2 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.        Restructuring charges   During the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $20 million and $17 million, respectively, of which $19 million and $12 million, respectively, related to the News and Information Services segment. The
restructuring charges recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were for employee termination benefits.      Additionally, in
connection with a reorganization at Dow Jones, the Company expects to incur approximately $50 to $60 million in restructuring charges during the remainder of fiscal 2017. The reorganization is expected to reduce the Company s costs by
approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018.

     Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates   Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates decreased
$23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of lower net income at Foxtel, mainly due to the $21 million loss resulting from Foxtel management s
decision to cease Presto operations in January 2017 and higher programming costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues and lower depreciation and amortization expense.

(a)   
        In accordance with
ASC 350, the Company amortized $19 million and $12 million, respectively, related to excess cost over the Company s proportionate share of its investment s underlying net assets allocated to finite-lived intangible assets during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Such amortization is reflected in Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the Statements of Operations. The increase in amortization expense recognized by the Company in the current year period was
offset by a corresponding decrease in amortization expense recognized by Foxtel as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in fiscal 2016.           Interest, net   Interest, net decreased $5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016, primarily due to the interest

Income tax benefit   The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016
was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate, primarily due to non-taxable book gains, which had a greater impact on the Company s effective tax rate for the quarter due to the Company s low pre-tax book loss.   
  The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax
benefit of approximately $106 million related to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to certain U.S. federal net operating losses and state deferred tax assets. This benefit was recognized in conjunction with
management s plan to dispose of the Company s digital education business as the Company expects to generate sufficient U.S. taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets prior to expiration.   
    Income from discontinued operations, net of tax   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not recognize any
income from discontinued operations as the operations of the digital education

business were discontinued during fiscal 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $46 million, primarily due to the
impact of a $151 million tax benefit recognized upon reclassification of the Digital Education segment to discontinued operations, which more than offset the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge and operating losses recorded in the first quarter of
fiscal 2016. (See Note 3 Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).        Net
income   Net income decreased $189 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016 primarily due to the $106 million tax benefit and income from discontinued operations
recognized in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017, lower Total Segment EBITDA and lower equity earnings from Foxtel.   
    Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016 due to higher results at REA Group, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations.   
    Segment Analysis        Segment EBITDA
is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, interest, net, other,
net, income tax benefit and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be
included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA.      Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company s chief operating decision
maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the Company s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the
Company s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors  data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors,
including customer tastes and preferences).   
         35

   Total Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for,
net (loss) income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and
impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company s financial performance. The Company believes that information about Total Segment EBITDA allows users of its Consolidated Financial Statements to
evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. The following table reconciles
Total Segment EBITDA to (loss) income from continuing operations:

   Revenues at the News and Information Services segment decreased $68 million, or 5%, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The revenue decrease was mainly due to lower advertising revenues of $72 million as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016, primarily resulting from
weakness in the print advertising market and a $6 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $19 million as compared to the corresponding
period of fiscal 2016 as a result of a $24 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, which more than offset modest increases in circulation revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other revenues of $23
million, primarily due to the acquisition of Unruly, which contributed $14 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016.     Segment
EBITDA at the News and Information Services segment decreased $37 million, or 45%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the lower advertising revenues
noted above, increased investment spending at Checkout 51 of $12 million and $5 million of transaction related costs associated with the acquisition of Wireless Group. The decrease was partially offset by lower newsprint, production and distribution
costs and the impact of cost savings initiatives.       News Corp Australia       Revenues at the Australian newspapers for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were relatively flat as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations
of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar resulted in a revenue increase of $13 million, or 4%. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $5 million primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as price
increases and digital subscriber growth offset print volume declines. Advertising revenues decreased $13 million due to weakness in the print advertising market in Australia, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
      News UK       For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, revenues at the U.K. newspapers decreased 18% as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. Advertising revenues decreased $30 million, primarily due to weakness in the print advertising market and the
negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $28 million due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as single-copy volume declines, primarily at  The Sun,  were offset by
the impact of cover price increases. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the British pound resulted in a revenue decrease of $49 million, or 15%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
corresponding period of fiscal 2016.       Dow Jones       Revenues at Dow Jones decreased 6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. Advertising revenues decreased $25 million due to weakness in
the print advertising market. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $4 million as a result of growth in circulation revenues at  The Wall Street Journal  due to price increases and higher subscription volume. Professional information
business revenues were relatively flat as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of $1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.       News America Marketing    
  Revenues at News America Marketing were relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal
2016, primarily due to decreased revenues for free-standing insert products, largely offset by higher in-store product and digital product revenues.

     Book Publishing   (20% of the Company s consolidated revenues in the three months ended

    Revenues at the Book Publishing segment decreased $20 million, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of $32 million in revenues associated with sales of  Go Set a Watchman  by Harper Lee in the prior year quarter and the negative impact of
foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by increased revenues from foreign language publishing and higher print sales due to the mix of titles. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted
in a revenue decrease of $7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. Digital sales, which consist of revenues generated through the sale of e-books and digital audio books,
represented 20% of Consumer revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Digital sales decreased 5% as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016 due to the mix of titles as compared to the prior year quarter.   
  Segment EBITDA at the Book Publishing segment increased $6 million, or 14%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the

listing volumes, higher revenues due to the acquisition of iProperty and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues at Move increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in
Connection for Co-brokerage   SM    product revenues and
non-listing media revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $5 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding
period of fiscal 2016.      Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased $10 million, or 18%, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the higher revenues noted above and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations at REA Group, partially offset by increased
marketing spend at REA Group and Move to drive traffic growth and brand awareness. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Segment EBITDA increase of $3 million, or 6%, for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.        Cable Network Programming   (7% and 6% of
the Company s consolidated revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively)       
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $4 million, or
3%, and Segment EBITDA decreased $14 million, or 50%, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. The revenue increase was due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and higher advertising revenues. The decrease in
Segment EBITDA was mainly the result of higher sports programming rights costs primarily related to the NRL simulcast and certain one-time cricket rights costs, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the English Premier League
rights. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar resulted in a revenue increase of $3 million, or 2%, and a Segment EBITDA decrease of $6 million, or 21%, for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2016.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    
    Current Financial Condition        The
Company s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents were $1,499 million. The Company expects these elements of
liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. As described in greater detail below, in October 2013, the Company established a revolving credit facility of $650 million, which terminates on October 23, 2020. The
Company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement and may also request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million. In addition, the Company
expects to have access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue debt if needed or desired. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the
capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs, its access to, and the availability of, financing on

acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the Company s performance, (ii) its credit rating or absence of a credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the
overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms. See Part II,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  for further
discussion.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company s consolidated assets included $670 million in cash and cash equivalents that was held
by its foreign subsidiaries. $78 million of this amount is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to
have access to its share of REA Group s cash balance. The Company earns income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings.
Should the Company require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the Company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. The transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be
cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and withholding taxes. Additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the Company.
     The principal uses of cash that affect the Company s liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including
employee costs and paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities and acquisitions. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to
continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Company s securities or the assumption of indebtedness.   
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities        In May 2013, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board of Directors ) authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its Class A Common Stock. On
May 10, 2015, the Company announced it had begun repurchasing shares of Class A Common Stock under the stock repurchase program. No stock repurchases were made during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Through October 31,
2016, the Company repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. The remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of October 31, 2016 was
approximately $429 million. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committee s decisions regarding future stock
repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Company s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements,
regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and
the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.        Dividends     
  In August 2016, the Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. This
dividend was paid on October 19, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 14, 2016. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors  decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual
restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the NAM Group s settlement payment of $250 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as well as higher working capital due to
timing and lower Total Segment EBITDA.      Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as
follows (in millions):       
    The Company had net cash used in investing activities of $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to net cash used in investing activities of $86 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $283 million of cash for acquisitions, primarily for the acquisition of
Wireless Group, and capital expenditures of $49 million. The net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by the utilization of restricted cash for the Wireless Group acquisition of $315
million.      During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had capital expenditures of $63 million and used $16 million of cash
for acquisitions, primarily for the acquisition of Checkout 51.      Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (in millions):       
    The change in net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the net
cash used in financing activities in the corresponding period of fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of the repayment of debt assumed in the acquisition of Wireless Group of $23 million.        Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow Available to News Corporation        Free cash flow
available to News Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities from continuing operations, less capital expenditures ( free cash flow ), less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash
dividends received from REA Group. Free cash flow available to News Corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from continuing operations and
other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in
the calculation of free cash flow.      The Company considers free cash flow available to News Corporation to provide useful information to
management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the Company s   
         41

balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company s business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. A limitation of
free cash flow available to News Corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying
on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporate all cash movements during the period.      The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by continuing operating activities to free cash flow available to News Corporation:   
   
    Free cash flow available to News Corporation decreased $384 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to
($317) million from $67 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower cash provided by operating activities as discussed above, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.   
    Revolving Credit Agreement        The
Company s Credit Agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) provides for an unsecured $650 million revolving credit facility (the  Facility ) that can be used for general corporate purposes. The Facility has a sublimit
of $100 million available for issuances of letters of credit. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request increases in the amount of the Facility up to a maximum amount of $900 million.   
  In October 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Amendment ) which, among other things, extended the
original term of the Facility by two years and lowered the commitment fee payable by the Company. As a result of the Amendment, the lenders  commitments now terminate on October 23, 2020, and any borrowings will be due at that time.
The Company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the Credit Agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.      The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, with customary exceptions, including limitations on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to
engage in transactions with affiliates, incur liens, merge into or consolidate with any other entity, incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries. In
addition, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. If any of the events of default occur and are not
cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.
     Interest on borrowings under the Facility is based on either (a) a Eurodollar Rate formula or (b) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in
the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the Credit Agreement, which varies based on the Company s adjusted operating income   
         42

leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was paying a commitment fee of 0.225% on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 0.50% for a Base Rate borrowing and 1.50% for a
Eurodollar Rate borrowing.      As of the date of this filing, the Company has not borrowed any funds under the Facility.   
    REA Group Unsecured Revolving Loan Facility        REA Group entered into a A$480 million unsecured syndicated revolving loan facility agreement in connection with the acquisition of iProperty (the  REA Facility ). The REA Facility consists of
three sub facilities of A$120 million, A$120 million and A$240 million which become due in December 2017, December 2018 and December 2019, respectively. In February 2016, REA Group drew down the full A$480 million (approximately $340 million as of
such date) available under the REA Facility, and the proceeds, less lenders  fees of $1 million, were used to fund the iProperty acquisition. Borrowings under the REA Facility bear interest at a floating rate of the Australian BBSY plus a
margin in the range of 0.85% and 1.45% depending on REA Group s net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, REA Group was paying a margin of between 0.90% and 1.10%. REA Group paid approximately $3 million in interest for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.9%. The REA Facility requires REA Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. As of September 30,
2016, REA Group was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants.        Commitments     
  The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ( firm commitments ) to make future payments. These firm commitments
secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The Company s commitments as of September 30, 2016 have not changed significantly from the disclosures included in the 2016 Form 10-K.
       Contingencies        The
Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed below. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often
cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with
the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.      The Company establishes an accrued
liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The
amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as
incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. For additional details see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      The Company s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, it is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The
Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
future results of operations or liquidity. As subsidiaries of 21st Century Fox prior to the Separation, the Company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st Century Fox for the consolidated U.S.
  
         43   

Table of Contents  

federal income taxes of the 21st Century Fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the Company or any of the Company s domestic subsidiaries were a member of the
21st Century Fox consolidated group. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the 21st Century Fox consolidated group. In conjunction with the Separation,
the Company entered into the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement with 21st Century Fox (the  Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement ), which requires 21st Century Fox to indemnify the Company for any such liability. Disputes or
assessments could arise during future audits by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) or other taxing authorities in amounts that the Company cannot quantify.

ITEM 3.   
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK         The Company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.
     The following sections provide quantitative information on the Company s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk.
The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.       Foreign Currency Rates       The Company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the
U.S. dollar; the Australian dollar; and the British pound sterling. These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company s U.S., Australian and U.K. operations, respectively. Cash is managed centrally within each of the
three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made
available from intercompany capital. The Company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its Australian and U.K. foreign operations.      Because of fluctuations in exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains
or losses arise from translating foreign entities  statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company s reporting currency (the U.S. dollar) for consolidation purposes. The Company does not hedge translation
risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. Exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the Australian dollar and British pound
sterling. As exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years.      The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016:   
   
    Based on the year ended June 30, 2016, a one cent change in each of the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar and the U.S.
dollar/British pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $32 million and $11 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted Total Segment EBITDA by approximately $7 million and
$0.4 million, respectively, on an annual basis.       Stock Prices       The Company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. These investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $139 million as of
September 30, 2016. A hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately $14 million before tax. Any changes in fair value of the Company s common stock
investments are not recognized unless deemed other-than-temporary.       Credit Risk    
  Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.   
         45   

Table of Contents  

   The Company s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of September
30, 2016 or June 30, 2016 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company s products and services are sold.      The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.   

ITEM 4.   
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES          (a)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures       The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and were
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.       (b) Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting       There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

    PART II    

ITEM 1.   
   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS         The following
information supplements the discussion set forth under  Legal Proceedings  in the Company s 2016 Form 10-K.       News America
Marketing        In-Store Marketing and FSI Purchasers       On February 29, 2016, the parties agreed to settle the litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in which The Dial Corporation, Henkel Consumer Goods, Inc., H.J. Heinz
Company, H.J. Heinz Company, L.P., Foster Poultry Farms, Smithfield Foods, Inc., HP Hood LLC and BEF Foods, Inc. alleged various claims under federal and state antitrust law against News Corporation, News America Incorporated ( NAI ),
News America Marketing FSI L.L.C. ( NAM FSI ) and News America Marketing In-Store Services L.L.C. ( NAM In-Store Services  and, together with News Corporation, NAI and NAM FSI, the  NAM Group ). Under the terms of
the settlement, the NAM Group agreed, among other things, to pay the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately $250 million, and the parties agreed to dismiss the litigation with prejudice. As required under the settlement agreement, the NAM
Group delivered the proposed settlement amount into escrow during the three months ended September 30, 2016, to be held pending District Court approval. On October 31, 2016, the District Court approved the settlement, and the settlement payment will
be released to the plaintiffs and their attorneys. The NAM Group also settled related claims for approximately $30 million in February 2016.   
   Valassis Communications, Inc.       As
reported in the 2016 Form 10-K, Valassis Communications, Inc. ( Valassis ) initiated two separate legal proceedings against certain of the Company s subsidiaries on November 8, 2013. In the first proceeding ( Valassis
I ), Valassis filed a motion for expedited discovery in a previously settled case involving NAI, NAM FSI and NAM In-Store Services based on its belief that defendants had engaged in activities prohibited under an order issued by the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the  Order ) in connection with the parties  settlement. Valassis subsequently filed a Notice of Violation of the Order (the  Notice ) in Valassis I alleging violations of
federal and state antitrust laws and common law business torts and seeking treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys  fees. In the second proceeding ( Valassis II ), Valassis filed a new complaint against the NAM Group in the
same District Court, which also alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and common law business torts and sought treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys  fees and costs. On March 30, 2016, the District Court ordered that
the Notice in Valassis I and the remaining claims in the NAM Group s motion to dismiss in Valassis II (the bundling and tying claims in Valassis II were dismissed without prejudice to Valassis s rights to pursue relief for the claims in
Valassis I) be referred to a panel of antitrust experts previously appointed in Valassis I (the  Antitrust Expert Panel ). The Antitrust Expert Panel was convened and, on September 24, 2016, issued a Report and Recommendation recommending
that the NAM Group s motion to dismiss the Valassis II complaint be denied. The Antitrust Expert Panel also scheduled a preliminary hearing in Valassis I for December 19, 2016 and ordered discovery to be completed by November 2017. While it is
not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of these actions, the NAM Group believes it has been compliant with applicable laws and intends to defend itself vigorously in both actions.   
   U.K. Newspaper Matters and Related Investigations and Litigation       As reported in the 2016 Form 10-K, a purported class action lawsuit captioned Wilder v. News Corp. was previously filed against 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch, Rebekah Brooks, Les Hinton
and the Company s subsidiary, NI Group Limited (now known as News Corp UK   Ireland Limited) in the U.S.

District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all purchasers of 21st Century Fox s common stock between July 8, 2009 and July 18, 2011 for claims under
Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act alleging that false and misleading statements were issued regarding alleged acts of voicemail interception at  The News of the World  and seeking compensatory damages, rescission for
damages sustained and costs. On September 30, 2015, the District Court dismissed all of plaintiffs  claims and on September 21, 2016, the District Court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. On October 21, 2016, plaintiffs 
time to appeal the District Court s decision expired, and the case was closed.       

ITEM 1A.   
   RISK FACTORS         There have been no material
changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.   

ITEM 2.   
   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS         In May 2013, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board of Directors ) authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its Class A Common Stock. On
May 10, 2015, the Company announced it had begun repurchasing shares of Class A Common Stock under the stock repurchase program. No stock repurchases were made during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Through October 31,
2016, the Company repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. The remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of October 31, 2016 was
approximately $429 million. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committee s decisions regarding future stock
repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Company s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements,
regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and
the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.
