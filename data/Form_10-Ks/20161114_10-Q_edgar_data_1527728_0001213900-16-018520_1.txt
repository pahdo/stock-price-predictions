1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and
2015 and for the periods then ended have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed
or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company s June 30, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

Business
and Basis of Presentation    DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc. ( DanDrit USA , the  Company ,  we ,
 us ,  our ) was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 18, 2011 as a vehicle to
pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business.   

DanDrit
BioTech A/S, a Danish Corporation was incorporated on April 1, 2001 ( DanDrit Denmark ) and is treated as a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 12, 2014, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Share Exchange Agreement (the
 Share Exchange Agreement ), DanDrit USA (the  Parent ) acquired approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of DanDrit BioTech A/S, a Danish corporation ( DanDrit Denmark ) and as a result became the parent of
DanDrit Denmark (the  Share Exchange ). Prior to the Share Exchange there were 5,000,000 shares of the common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common Stock ) of DanDrit Denmark s parent company (the  Parent )
outstanding. The Parent and a shareholder agreed to cancel 4,400,000 shares of its common stock and issued 1,440,000 shares of
common stock for legal and consulting services related to the Share Exchange and a future financing. At the time of the Share
Exchange, the outstanding shares of the common stock of DanDrit Denmark were exchanged for 1.498842 shares of Parent s common
stock, for a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock (including 185,053 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in accordance
with Section 70 of the Danish Companies Act and the Articles of Association of DanDrit Denmark to the Non-Consenting Shareholders,
deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes). Following the closing of the Share Exchange, DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc.,
the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into the Company, thereby changing the Company s name to  DanDrit
Biotech USA, Inc.  DanDrit Denmark engages in the research and development, manufacturing and clinical trials of pharmaceutical
and biological products for the human treatment of cancer using the dendritic cell technology.  

Fiscal
Year End  - In June 2015, DanDrit s board of directors approved a change to DanDrit s fiscal year end from December 31
to June 30.   

Reverse
Acquisition    On February 12, 2014, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ),
DanDrit USA completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark (the  Share
Exchange ) and as a result became DanDrit Denmark s parent company (the  Parent ). Prior to the Share
Exchange there were 5,000,000 shares of the common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the  Common Stock ) of Parent
outstanding. Parent and an existing shareholder agreed to cancel 4,400,000 shares of its Common Stock and issued 1,440,000 shares
of Common Stock for legal and consulting services related to the Share Exchange and a future public offering. At the time of the
Share Exchange each outstanding share of common stock of DanDrit Denmark was exchanged for 1.498842 shares of Parent s Common
Stock, for a total of 6,000,000 shares, resulting in 8,040,000 shares of the Parent s Common Stock outstanding immediately
following the Share Exchange, including 185,053 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance in accordance with Section 70 of
the Danish Companies Act and the Articles of Association of DanDrit Denmark to the DanDrit Denmark shareholders who have not consented
to the Share Exchange (the  Non-Consenting Shareholders ), and deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes.  

Consolidation
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts
and operations of DanDrit Denmark, and the accounts and operations of DanDrit USA. All material inter-company transactions and
accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.

NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Functional
Currency / Foreign currency translation    The functional currency of DanDrit USA is the U.S. Dollar. The functional
currency of DanDrit Denmark is the Danish Kroner ( DKK ). The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar
for the purpose of these financial statements. The Company s balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at
the period-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing
during the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. Translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a component
of other comprehensive income in stockholders  equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations
from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statement of operations as
incurred.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company had balances held in financial institutions in Denmark
of $31,675 and $23,368, respectively.  

Property
and Equipment    Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend
the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized, upon being placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets which range from four to nine years (See Note 3).  

Intangible
Assets    Definite life intangible assets include patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification, ( ASC )
Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  and amortized the patents on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful life of twenty years. Costs incurred in relation to patent applications are capitalized cost and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the patent. If it is determined that a patent will not be issued, the related remaining patent application costs
are charged to expense.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment and patents are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Circumstances
which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant
adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history
of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will
more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.  

Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value
of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. The depreciable basis of assets that are impaired
and continue in use is their respective fair values.  

Revenue
Recognition and Sales    The Company s sales of its MelCancerVac  ( MCV ) colorectal cancer vaccine
have been limited to a compassionate use basis in Singapore after stage IIA trials and is not approved for current sale for any
other use or location. The Company's accounts for revenue recognition in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  (SAB 101), and FASB ASC 605 Revenue
Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when rights and risk of ownership have passed to the customer, when there is persuasive
evidence of an arrangement, product has been shipped or delivered to the customer, the price and terms are finalized, and collections
of resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Products are primarily shipped FOB shipping point at which time title passes to
the customer.  

Value
Added Tax    In Denmark, Value Added Tax ( VAT ) of 25% of the invoice amount is collected in respect of
the sales of goods on behalf of tax authorities. The VAT collected is not revenue of the Company; instead, the amount is recorded
as a liability on the balance sheet until such VAT is paid to the authorities. VAT of 25% is also paid to Danish and EU vendors
on invoices these amounts are refundable from the respective governmental authority and recorded as other receivables in the accompanying
financial statements.  

Research
and Development Expenses    The Company expenses research and development costs incurred in formulating, improving, validating
and creating alternative or modified processes related to and expanding the use of our MAGE  A dendrite cell cancer therapy.
Research and development expenses were included in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
totaled $17,104 and $101,759, respectively.  

Our
research and development expenses may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the clinical studies and the
timing of samples supporting the clinical studies.

NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Income
Taxes    The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. This
statement requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.  

Loss Per Share   
The Company calculates earnings /(loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common
share (EPS) are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings
per common share are based on shares outstanding (computed as under basic EPS) and potentially dilutive common shares. Potential
shares of common stock included in the diluted earnings per share calculation include in-the-money stock options that have been
granted but have not been exercised. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial
liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements . The authoritative guidance, which, among
other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each
major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as
the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions,
the guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
    1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level
    2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level
    3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.   

Unless
otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Company s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid
expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital lease obligations and notes payable approximates their recorded
values due to their short-term maturities.  

Accounting
Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new standard to achieve
a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting
companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer
obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed
to delay the effective date by one year; accordingly, the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018
and we expect to adopt it at that time. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.
We have not yet selected a transition method, nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial
statements.

NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

In
2015, the FASB issued an amended standard requiring that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on
the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and non-current. The amended standard is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted and we are evaluating whether we will early adopt. The amended
standard may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will
have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued changes to the accounting for leases that primarily affect presentation and disclosure requirements.
The new standard will require the recognition of a right to use asset and underlying lease liability for operating leases with
an initial life in excess of one year. This standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We have not yet
determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.   

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the
Company's present or future financial statements.  

Reclassification
   The financial statement for the period ended September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016 have been reclassified to conform
to the headings and classifications used in the September 30, 2016 financial statements.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of
the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has incurred
significant losses, has not yet been successful in establishing profitable operations and has short-term obligations in excess
of anticipated cash. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In
this regard, management plans to mitigate this doubt by raising additional funds through debt and/or equity offerings. The Company
is attempting to raise $15,000,000 or more through a private placement offering and close the acquisition of OncoSynergy, Inc.
The closing of the private placement is contingent on the closing of the acquisition of the assets of OncoSynergy, Inc. There
is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds through the debt or equity or achieving profitable
operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

NOTE
9   INCOME TAXES   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes; which requires the Company
to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences
between book and tax accounting and any available operating loss or tax credit carry forwards. The amount of and ultimate realization
of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Company s
future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined.  

As of September
30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $10,379,545 at an estimated effective tax rate of
22% or approximately $2,283,500 for Danish tax purposes which do not expire and net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$1,048,174 at an estimated effective tax rate of 34% or approximately $356,379 for U.S. Federal Tax purposes which expire through
2034, a portion of which shall be limited due to the change in control of the Parent. 

The
Company files U.S. and Danish income tax returns, and they are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior
to 2012 and 2008, respectively.  

The
temporary differences, tax credits and carry forwards gave rise to the following deferred tax asset (liabilities) at September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:  

In
accordance with prevailing accounting guidance, the Company is required to recognize and disclose any income tax uncertainties.
The guidance provides a two-step approach to recognize and disclose any income tax uncertainties. The guidance provides a two-step
approach to recognizing and measuring tax benefits and liabilities when realization of the tax position is uncertain. The first
step is to determine whether the tax position meet the more-likely-than-not condition for recognition and the second step is to
determine the amount to be recognized based on the cumulative probability that exceeds 50%. The amount of and ultimate realization
of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Company s
future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which can be difficult to determine and can only be estimated. Management
estimates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate adequate net profits to use the deferred tax assets;
and consequently, a valuation allowance was recorded for all deferred tax assets.  

A
reconciliation of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to income tax expense at the Company s effective rate
is as follows at September 30, 2016 and 2015:

product intended for use in humans is subject to rigorous testing requirements imposed by the FDA with respect to product efficacy
and safety, possible toxicity and side effects. FDA approval for the use of new bio products (which can never be assured) requires
several rounds of extensive preclinical testing and clinical investigations conducted by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company
prior to sale and use of the product. At each stage, the approvals granted by the FDA include the manufacturing process utilized
to produce the product. Accordingly, the Company s cell systems used for the production of therapeutic or bio therapeutic
products are subject to significant regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended.  

Product
liability -   The contract production services for therapeutic products offered exposes an inherent risk of liability as
bio therapeutic substances manufactured, at the request and to the specifications of customers, could foreseeably cause adverse
effects. The Company seeks to obtain agreements from contract production customers indemnifying and defending the Company from
any potential liability arising from such risk. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in obtaining
such agreements in the future or that such indemnification agreements will adequately protect the Company against potential claims
relating to such contract production services. The Company may also be exposed to potential product liability claims by users
of its products. A successful partial or completely uninsured claim against the Company could have a material adverse effect on
the Company s operations.

Contingencies
  - The Company is from time to time involved in routine legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types.

Description
of Business    

We
are a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing targeted oncology vaccines that address major medical needs to
advance cancer care. We are developing a polytopic (mainly MAGE-A family) dendritic cell vaccine cancer immuno therapy, which
address patient populations of cancer survivors to prevent recurrence. Our lead product candidate, MCV, is a dendritic cell vaccine
that could strengthen the immune response in colorectal cancer patients. In December 2013, DanDrit Denmark entered into an agreement
with a Dutch company that provides access to non-registered medicines for patients with life threatening diseases, regarding a
Patient Name Use Program (PNU) for MCV. This program will allow us to sell to the Dutch company MCV for one year of treatment
(10 vaccines) to cancer patients.

stock and issued 1,440,000 shares of common stock for legal and consulting services related to the Share Exchange and a future
financing. At the time of the Share Exchange, the outstanding shares of the common stock of DanDrit Denmark were exchanged for
1.498842 shares of Parent s common stock, for a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock (including 185,053 shares of common
stock reserved for issuance in accordance with Section 70 of the Danish Companies Act and the Articles of Association of DanDrit
Denmark to the Non-Consenting Shareholders, deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes). Following the closing of the
Share Exchange, DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into the Company, thereby
changing the Company s name to  DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc.   

On
February 14, 2014, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (the  Registration Statement ) to register
2,400,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per share in an initial public offering of up to an aggregate of
$12,000,000 in gross proceeds. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on August 14, 2014 (the  Offering ).
In connection with the Offering, the Company issued and sold an aggregate 1,493,290 shares of common stock for gross proceeds
of $5,466,450 and total aggregate gross proceeds of $5,310,089 raised in the Offerings.  

On
December 31, 2014, the Company received $2,000,000 in connection with a private offering of 400,000 shares of common stock at
an offering price of $5.00 per share.  

On
September 24, 2014, DanDrit Denmark signed a contract of collaboration with the University Hospital IRCCS  San Martino 
- IST   National Institute for Cancer Research, known as the San Martino Hospital of Genoa. Dr. Alberto Sobrero, the Head
of the Medical Oncology Unit at the San Martino Hospital, is principal investigator of the randomized multicenter study. The collaboration
relates to a Phase III adjuvant study of DanDrit s vaccine in patients with no evident disease stage IV colorectal cancer.
The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of DanDrit s MelCancerVac  ( MCV ) in stage IV
CRC patients rendered disease free after the completion of standard treatments in accordance with local practices.  

The
Company is an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ( JOBS
Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections
14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation
and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  

The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election,
our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our
revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period,
(3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market
value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently
completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a  smaller reporting company , as such
term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company,
certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting
company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes
Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial
statements, instead of three years.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

We
have historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through funding from our largest shareholders, the issuance
of convertible notes (which over time have been converted into shares of our common stock) and the sale of common stock.  

As of September
30, 2016, the Company had $31,675 in cash and working deficit of $(625,497) as compared to June 30, 2016, when the Company had
$23,368 in cash and working deficit of $(775,750). The increase in cash and working capital is primarily due to the Company s
efforts to secure financings through equity offering and expenses for research and development attributable to the Company engaging
an entity to perform Phase III clinical trial of MelCancerVac . 

Following
is a summary of the company s cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:  

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of
the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company has
incurred significant losses, has not yet been successful in establishing profitable operations and has short-term obligations
in excess of anticipated cash. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
In this regard, management plans to mitigate this doubt by raising additional funds through debt and/or equity offerings. The
Company is attempting to raise $15,000,000 or more through a private placement offering and close the acquisition of the assets
of OncoSynergy, Inc. The closing of the private placement is contingent on the closing of the acquisition of the assets of OncoSynergy,
Inc.There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds through the debt or equity or achieving
profitable operations.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of these uncertainties.  

We
may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies complementary
to our business. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of
equity or debt securities. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when
needed could materially adversely impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of $38,235 for professional fees paid by a related party and amounts advanced to
the Parent are reported as loan payable - related party. The $38,235 loan payable was acquired in the reverse acquisition. The
amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and has no stipulated repayment terms.  

A 6% Promissory Note payable
(the  Note ) to NLBDIT 2010 Enterprises, LLC, an entity controlled by a shareholder of the Company, was acquired by
the Company in the reverse acquisition, payable on February 12, 2014 upon the completion date of the Share Exchange. As of September
30, 2016, and 2015, the outstanding balance on the Note, including accrued interest, was $47,825 and $45,471, respectively. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded related party interest on the Note of $592, and $592,
respectively. 

On
July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a non-interest bearing convertible notes for $60,150, with a shareholder of the Company.
The note matures December 31, 2017. The note is convertible into shares of common stock at $2.00 per share. As the Company s
stock was trading at $2.50 on July 1, 2016, the Company bifurcated the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature and
recorded a discount of $15,038. As the note is non-interest bearing the Company imputed the interest at 3% and further recorded
a discount of $2,639. The interest is being amortized to expense using the effective interest method through the December 31,
2017 maturity. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense of $2,527 was recorded for the amortization of
the discount. 

On July 19, 2016,
the Company entered into a non-interest bearing convertible notes for $60,150, with a shareholder of the Company. The note matures
December 31, 2017. The note is convertible into shares of common stock at $2.00 per share. As the note is non-interest bearing
the Company imputed the interest at 3% and further recorded a discount of $2,555. The interest will be amortized to expense using
the effective interest method through the December 31, 2017 maturity. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense
of $346 was recorded for the amortization of the discount. 

On August 24, 2016, the
Company entered into a non-interest bearing convertible notes for $90,225. The note matures December 31, 2017. The note is convertible

bearing the Company imputed the interest at 3% and further recorded a discount of $3,577. The interest will be amortized to expense
using the effective interest method through the December 31, 2017 maturity. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest
expense of $425 was recorded for the amortization of the discount.

convertible into shares of common stock at $2.00 per share. As the note is non-interest bearing the Company imputed the interest
at 3% and further recorded a discount of $5,630. The interest will be amortized to expense using the effective interest method
through the December 31, 2017 maturity. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense of $107 was recorded for
the amortization of the discount. 

Results
of Operations    

The
Company s sole source of operations is through its wholly owned Danish subsidiary, DanDrit Biotech A/S ( DanDrit Denmark ).
There can be no assurance that DanDrit Denmark will be successful in obtaining US Food and Drug Administration approval of its
colorectal vaccine, MCV, nor produce sufficient revenues from MCV to sustain operations. It is management's assertion that these
circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s plan of operation for the next
twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to raise capital and revenues associated with its MCV product.

three months ended September 30, 2015 representing an increase of $(442,879) or 126%. The net increase was primarily due to the

30, 2016 compared to $1,508,229 as of June 30, 2016. The increases in total assets and decrease in total current liabilities were
mainly due to a continued loss from operations for research and development, additional borrowing and expenditures to raise additional
capital funding. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  

Emerging
Growth Company    

As
an  emerging growth company  under the JOBS Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those
standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with public company effective dates.  

Significant
Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates   

The
methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that
we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. In addition, Section 107 of the
JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are not choosing
to  opt out  of this provision. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended
transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. As a result of our election, not to  opt
out  of Section 107, DanDrit s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company
effective dates.  

For
a full explanation of our accounting policies, see Note 1 to the financial statements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is not
required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our Chief Executive
Officer (the  Certifying Officer ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
for the Company.  The Certifying Officer has designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information is made known to him, particularly during the period in which this Report was prepared. 

The Certifying Officer
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company used the  Internal
Control over Financial Reporting Integrated Framework  issued by Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO )
to conduct an extensive review of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Exchange
Act, Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of each of the periods covered by this Report (the  Evaluation Date ).  Based
upon that evaluation, the Certifying Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective in ensuring that the information we were required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and forms. The deficiencies are attributed to the fact that the Company does
not have adequate resources to address complex accounting issues, as well as an inadequate number of persons to whom it can segregate
accounting tasks within the Company so as to ensure the segregation of duties between those persons who approve and issue
payment from those persons who are responsible to record and reconcile such transactions within the Company s accounting
system.  These control deficiencies will be monitored and attention will be given to the matter as we continue to accelerate
through our current growth stage. 

The Certifying Officer
based his conclusion on the fact that the Company has identified material weaknesses in controls over financial reporting, detailed
below.  In order to reduce the impact of these weaknesses to an acceptable level, the Company has contracted with consultants
with expertise in U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting standards to review and compile all financial information prior to filing
that information with the SEC.  However, even with the added expertise of these consultants, we still expect to be deficient
in our internal controls over disclosure and procedures until sufficient capital is available to hire the appropriate internal
accounting staff and individuals with requisite GAAP and SEC financial reporting knowledge.  There have been no significant
changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Controls    

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

There
are presently no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries, is a party or as to which
any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.

a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is not
