VERTICAL COMPUTER
SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1. Organization,
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements of Vertical Computer Systems, Inc. ( we ,  our , the  Company 
or  Vertical ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto contained in Vertical s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively,  our ,
 we , the  Company  or  VCSY , as applicable). Vertical s subsidiaries which currently
maintain daily business operations are NOW Solutions, a 75% owned subsidiary, and SnAPPnet, Inc. ( SnAPPnet ), an 80%
owned subsidiary of Vertical. Vertical s subsidiaries which have minimal operations are Vertical do Brasil, Taladin, Inc.
( Taladin ), and Vertical Healthcare Solutions, Inc. ( VHS ), each of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Vertical, as well as Priority Time Systems, Inc. ( Priority Time ) a 70% owned subsidiary, Ploinks, Inc. ( Ploinks )
(formerly, OptVision Research, Inc.), a 93% owned subsidiary and Government Internet Systems, Inc. ( GIS ), an 84.5%
owned subsidiary. Vertical s subsidiaries which are inactive include EnFacet, Inc. ( ENF ), Globalfare.com, Inc.
( GFI ), Pointmail.com, Inc. and Vertical Internet Solutions, Inc. ( VIS ), each of which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Vertical. 

In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results
of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would
substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements as reported in the 2015 annual report on Form
10-K have been omitted. 

Earnings per share   

Basic earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of
the Company s common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share  reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if our share-based awards, stock warrants and convertible securities were exercised or converted into
common stock. The dilutive effect of our share-based awards is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all share-based
awards are exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise are used to purchase common stock at the average market price
during the period. The incremental shares (difference between shares assumed to be issued versus purchased), to the extent they
would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. The dilutive effect of our convertible
preferred stock and convertible debentures is computed using the if-converted method, which assumes conversion at the beginning
of the year. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents related to the convertible debentures, convertible debt and preferred
stock and stock derivative liability were not included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share as their effect would
be anti-dilutive. 

Reclassifications   

Certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. 

Capitalized
Software Costs   

Software
costs incurred internally in creating computer software products are expensed until technological feasibility has been established
upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized until the point that the
product is ready for sale, and are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The Company
considers annual amortization of capitalized software costs based on the ratio of current year revenues by product to the total
estimated revenues by the product, subject to an annual minimum based on straight-line amortization over the product s estimated
economic useful life, not to exceed five years. The Company periodically reviews capitalized software costs for impairment where
the fair value is less than the carrying value.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company capitalized an aggregate of $246,184 related to software development and
wrote off $1,421,155 of impaired software development costs.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company capitalized an aggregate of $489,148 related to software development.  

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company does not
expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company s financial
position, operations or cash flows. 

Note 2. Going Concern 

The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared assuming that we will
continue as a going concern, and accordingly realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not purport to represent realizable or settlement
values. As of September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of approximately $19.6 million and defaulted on several of our
debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our management is continuing
its efforts to attempt to secure funds through equity and/or debt instruments for our operations, expansion and possible acquisitions,
mergers, joint ventures, and/or other business combinations. The Company will require additional funds to pay down its liabilities,
as well as finance its expansion plans consistent with anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure. However, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure additional funds and that if such funds are available, whether the terms
or conditions would be acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will be able to turn into a profitable position and generate
positive operating cash flow. The consolidated financial statements contain no adjustment for the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Note 3. Notes Payable  

The following table
reflects our third-party debt activity, including our convertible debt, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements under which third party subscribers purchased 750 shares
of Series A 4% Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock of the Company ( VCSY Series A Preferred Stock ) for $150,000.
In connection with the purchase of the VCSY Series A Preferred Stock, the subscribers also received a total of 1,500,000 shares
of common stock of the Company with the Rule 144 restrictive legend, 75,000 shares of common stock of Ploinks, Inc., 2 year warrants
under which the subscribers may purchase an aggregate total of 112,500 unregistered shares of common stock of the Company at a
purchase price of $0.10 per share and 2 year warrants under which the subscribers may purchase an aggregate total of 112,500 unregistered
shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $0.20 per share. The allocated fair market value of the VCSY Series
A Preferred Stock issued to the subscribers was $24,810. Each share of VCSY Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 500 shares
of the Company s common stock. The allocated fair market value of all common shares of the Company issued to the subscribers
was $99,238. The allocated fair market value of all common shares of Ploinks, Inc. issued to the subscribers was $24,861. The fair
market value of all warrants issued to the subscribers was $1,091 (which was calculated using the Black-Sholes model). The warrants
were accounted for as derivative liabilities (see Note 4). 

During the nine months
ended, September 30, 2016, $74,000 of principal, interest and fees under a convertible note issued in the principal amount of $80,000
were converted into 5,311,465 unrestricted common shares of the Company. 

Lakeshore Financing  

On January 9, 2013,
NOW Solutions completed a financing transaction in the aggregate amount of $1,759,150, which amount was utilized to pay off existing
indebtedness of the Company and NOW Solutions to Tara Financial Services and Robert Farias, a former employee of the Company, and
all security interests granted to Tara Financial Services and Mr. Farias were cancelled. 

In connection with
this financing, the Company and several of its subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the   Loan Agreement  ),
dated as of January 9, 2013 with Lakeshore Investment, LLC (  Lakeshore  ) under which NOW Solutions issued a
secured 10-year promissory note (the   Lakeshore Note  ) bearing interest at 11% per annum to Lakeshore in the
amount of $1,759,150 payable in equal monthly installments of $24,232 until January 31, 2022. Upon the payment of any prepayment
principal amounts, the monthly installment payments shall be proportionately adjusted proportionately on an amortized rata
basis.  

The Lakeshore Note
is secured by the assets of the Company s subsidiaries, NOW Solutions, Priority Time, SnAPPnet, Inc. (  SnAPPnet  )
and the Company s SiteFlash  technology and cross-collateralized. Upon the aggregate principal payment of $290,000
toward the Lakeshore Note, the Company has the option to have Lakeshore release either the Priority Time collateral or the SiteFlash 
collateral. Upon payment of the aggregate principal of $590,000 toward the Lakeshore Note, Lakeshore shall release either the Priority
Time collateral or the SiteFlash  collateral (whichever is remaining). Upon payment of the aggregate principal of $890,000
toward the Lakeshore Note, Lakeshore shall release the SnAPPnet collateral and upon full payment of the Lakeshore Note, Lakeshore
shall release the NOW Solutions collateral. 

As additional consideration
for the loan, the Company granted a 5% interest in Net Claim Proceeds (less any attorney s fees and direct costs) from any
litigation or settlement proceeds related to the SiteFlash  technology to Lakeshore which was increased to 8% under an amendment
to the Loan Agreement in 2013. In addition, until the Note is paid in full, NOW Solutions agreed to pay a Lakeshore royalty of
6% of its annual gross revenues in excess of $5 million dollars up to a maximum of $1,759,150. Management has estimated the fair
value of the royalty to be nominal as of its issuance date and no royalty was owed as of September 30, 2015 or December 31, 2014. 

In December 2014, the
Company and Lakeshore entered into an amendment of the Lakeshore Note and the Loan Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment,
NOW Solutions agreed to make $2,500 weekly advance payments to Lakeshore to be applied to the 25% dividend of NOW Solutions 
net income after taxes in connection with Lakeshore s 25% minority ownership interest in NOW Solutions. Within 10 business
days after the Company files its periodic reports with the SEC, NOW Solutions is required to make quarterly payment advances to
Lakeshore based on 60% of Lakeshore s 25% share of NOW Solutions estimated quarterly net income after taxes, less any weekly
payment advances received by Lakeshore during the then-applicable quarter and the weekly $2,500 payments shall be increased or
decreased based only upon any increases or decreases of maintenance and cloud-based offering fees during the then-completed quarter
(but will not decrease below a minimum of $2,500 per week). NOW Solutions shall pay Lakeshore the balance of Lakeshore s
25% of NOW s yearly net income after taxes (less any advances) within 10 business days after the Company files it annual
10-K report with the SEC and any payments in excess of Lakeshore s 25% of NOW yearly profit shall be credited towards future
weekly advance payments. The Company also agreed to pay attorney fees of $40,000 and paid fees of $80,000 to a former consultant
and employee of the Company who is a member of Lakeshore. In consideration of the extension to cure the default under the Lakeshore
Note and the Loan Agreement, the Company transferred a 20% ownership interest in Priority Time Systems, Inc., a 90% owned subsidiary
of VCSY, and in SnAPPnet, Inc., a 100% owned subsidiary of VCSY, to Lakeshore. This resulted in an additional non-controlling interest
recognized in the equity of the Company of $391,920 and $99,210 for Priority Time Systems, Inc. and SnAPPnet, Inc., respectively,
during 2014. The Company had an option to buy back Lakeshore s ownership interest in NOW Solutions, Priority Time and SnAPPnet,
Inc. (which expired on January 31, 2015). 

In July 2015, we entered
into an agreement with Lakeshore to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement and the Lakeshore Note. Under the terms of the amendment,
the Company issued 13,000,000 common shares with the Rule 144 restrictive legend, resulting in a forbearance loss of $455,000 and
Ploinks agreed to issue 3,000,000 common shares of its stock to Lakeshore. The fair value of the Ploinks shares was determined
to be nominal. Also in July 2015, the Company further amended the Lakeshore Note and the Loan Agreement with Lakeshore. Pursuant
to this Agreement, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend resulting in a
forbearance loss of $54,200 and paid $15,000 to Lakeshore as forbearance fees. 

In August 2015, we
entered into an agreement with Lakeshore to amend the terms of the Loan Agreement and the Lakeshore Note. Under the terms of the
amendment, the Company issued 7,000,000 shares of its common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend resulting in a forbearance
loss of $175,700 and Ploinks agreed to issue 2,000,000 common shares of its stock to Lakeshore. The fair value of the Ploinks shares
was determined to be nominal. 

In January 2016, the
Company re-amortized the Lakeshore Note at 11% interest per annum pursuant to the amendment of the Loan Agreement and Note executed
on August 6, 2015.  The Company has made all monthly installment payments towards the Note and the $2,500 weekly payments
which will be applied toward Lakeshore s share of dividends through the date of this Report. 

The Lakeshore note
is currently in default and the Company is currently in discussions with Lakeshore to resolve all outstanding issues, including
the reconciliation payment due on January 15, 2016. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, NOW Solutions, a subsidiary of the Company, paid dividends to Lakeshore of $222,500. 

Note 4. Derivative Liability and Fair
Value Measurements  

Derivative liability  

During 2016, certain
notes issued by the Company became convertible and qualified as derivative liabilities under ASC 815. In addition, the outstanding
common stock warrants associated with the notes became tainted and were required to be accounted for as derivative liabilities
under ASC 815. 

As of September 30,
2016, the aggregate fair value of the outstanding derivative liabilities was $425,740. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the net gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities was $49,291. 

The Company estimated
the fair value of the derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following key assumptions during
2016: 

Fair value measurements  

FASB ASC 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1    Quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2    Observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3    Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using
pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of
fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

If the inputs used
to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 

The following table provides a summary of
the fair value of our derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The estimated fair
value of short-term financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and deferred
revenue approximates their carrying value due to their short-term nature. The Company uses Level 3 inputs to estimate the fair
value of its derivative liabilities. 

The below table presents
the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Note 5. Common and Preferred Stock Transactions  

In January 2016, the
Company granted 2,000,000 unregistered shares of its common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend and 200,000 shares of Ploinks
common stock to a consultant of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a consulting agreement with the Company. The aggregate
fair market value of the 2,000,000 share award was determined to be $44,000. In addition, the Company agreed to issue up to 15,000,000
common shares of the Company and 1,500,000 shares of Ploinks common stock pursuant to restricted performance stock agreements with
the consultant. These shares may vest over a term of 3 years and are based upon the Consultant achieving certain performance criteria. 

In March 2016, the
Company cancelled 1,000,000 unregistered shares of its common stock issued during 2015 to a third party lender under an agreement
to amend certain promissory notes issued by the Company and NOW Solutions in the aggregate principal amount of $715,000. Under
the amendment, the Company agreed to make $22,000 monthly payments and an additional $10,000 penalty if such monthly payment is
not timely made. The cancellation resulted in the reversal of forbearance fees expense of $28,900 during the three months ended
March 31, 2016. 

In March 2016, the
Company issued 10,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to its consolidated subsidiary
Ploinks. These shares are held in treasury.  In exchange, Ploinks issued 5,000,000 of its common shares to the Company. 

In April 2016, the
Company and a third party noteholder entered into an agreement under which the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend in exchange for the cancellation of $130,000 in principal owed under a note payable
issued by NOW Solutions with a principal amount of $213,139. The fair market value of the shares was $92,500. A gain on debt extinguishment
of $37,500 was recorded for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

In May 2016, the Company
and William Mills entered into an agreement under which the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock
with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to Mr. Mills in exchange for the cancellation of $100,000 in fees owed for services rendered
by Mr. Mills as a Director and Secretary of the Company. The fair market value of the shares was $100,000. William Mills is a partner
of Parker Mills and the Secretary and a Director of the Company. 

In May 2016, the Company
and a third party entered into an agreement under which the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock
with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to the third party in lieu of paying $35,969 in fees, expenses, and interest owed to the third
party for services rendered to the Company and its subsidiaries.  The fair market value of the shares issued was $37,500. 
A loss on debt extinguishment of $1,531 was recorded for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

In May 2016, the Company
issued 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to a third party for services rendered.
The fair market value of the shares was $11,550 and was recorded as legal fees for the period ended September 30, 2016. 

Also in May 2016, the
Company issued 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to another third party for
services rendered. The fair market value of the shares was $11,000 and was recorded as tax consulting fees for the period ended
September 30, 2016. 

In June 2016, the 
 Company granted 1,500,000 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to a
consultant of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a restricted stock agreement with the Company under which the shares
vest in equal installments over a 6 month to 30-month period. The fair market value of the shares was $33,750 and is being amortized
to expense over the vesting period. For the period ended September 30, 2016, $15,288 was amortized to stock compensation expense. 

In June 2016, the Company
granted 3,500,000 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock with the Rule 144 restrictive legend to employees and
a former employee of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to an amended agreement to defer payroll. For additional details,
please see  Related Party Transactions  in Note 6. The fair market value of the shares was $78,750. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $665,000 to various third
party lenders for loans made to the Company in the same amount. The debts accrue interest at 10% per annum and are due one year
from the date of issuance. Beginning six months after issuance of the respective debentures and provided that the lowest closing
price of the common stock for each of the 5 trading days immediately preceding the conversion date has been $0.03 or higher, the
holder of the respective debenture may convert the debenture into shares of common stock at a price per share of 80% of the average
per share price of the Company s common stock for the 5 trading days preceding the notice of conversion date using the 3
lowest closing prices. In connection with the loans, the Company also issued a total of 6,650,000 shares of common stock of the
Company to the lenders with the Rule 144 restrictive legend and 3 year warrants under which each lender may purchase in aggregate
a total of 6,650,000 unregistered shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $0.10 per share. In connection with
the issuance of shares of common stock and warrants, the Company recorded a discount of $385,779 against the face value of the
loans based on the relative fair market value of the common stock and full fair market value of the warrants. The warrants are
accounted for as derivative liabilities. The discount is being amortized over twelve months and $141,885 of amortization expense
was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months
ended, September 30, 2016, $74,000 of principal, interest and fees under a convertible note issued in the principal amount of $80,000
were converted into 5,311,465 unrestricted common shares of the Company. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements under which third party subscribers purchased 750 shares
of VCSY Series A Preferred Stock for $150,000. In connection with the purchase of the VCSY Series A Preferred Stock, the subscribers
also received a total of 1,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company with the Rule 144 restrictive legend, 75,000 shares of
common stock of Ploinks, Inc., 2 year warrants under which the subscribers may purchase an aggregate total of 112,500 unregistered
shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $0.10 per share and 2 year warrants under which the subscribers may
purchase an aggregate total of 112,500 unregistered shares of common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $0.20 per share.
The allocated fair market value of the VCSY Series A Preferred Stock issued to the subscribers was $24,810. Each share of VCSY
Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 500 shares of the Company s common stock. The allocated fair market value of
all common shares of the Company issued to the subscribers was $99,238. The allocated fair market value of all common shares of
Ploinks, Inc. issued to the subscribers was $8,100. The fair market value of all warrants issued to the subscribers was $24,861
(which was calculated using the Black-Sholes model). The warrants were accounted for as derivative liabilities (see Note 4). 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, 1,175,000 VCSY common shares issued under restricted stock agreements to consultants and employees of
the Company vested. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the   Company cancelled 200,000 previously awarded but unvested unregistered shares of the Company s
common stock issued to an employee of the Company when the employee resigned. This resulted in the reversal of previously recognized
compensation expense of $1,145 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Stock compensation
expense for the amortization of restricted stock awards for Ploinks, Inc. and VCSY stock was $429,577 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there were 19,305,000 shares of unvested stock compensation awards to employees and
16,600,000 shares of unvested stock compensation awards to non-employees for VCSY stock. As of September 30, 2016, there were 5,225,999
shares of unvested stock compensation awards to employees for Ploinks, Inc. stock. 

We have evaluated our
convertible cumulative preferred stock under the guidance set out in FASB ASC 470-20 and accordingly classified these shares as
temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Option and warrant
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized as follows: 

The weighted average
remaining life of the outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2016 was 2.295. The intrinsic value of the exercisable warrants
as of September 30, 2016 was $.022.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.      

The following discussion
is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary or useful in reviewing the Company s results of operations,
liquidity and capital resources. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the accompanying Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements, and the cautionary statements and risk factors included below in Item 1A of Part II of this
Report. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Capitalized Software Costs  

Software costs
incurred internally in creating computer software products are expensed until technological feasibility has been established
upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized until the point that
the product is ready for sale, and are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The
Company considers annual amortization of capitalized software costs based on the ratio of current year revenues by product to
the total estimated revenues by the product, subject to an annual minimum based on straight-line amortization over the
product s estimated economic useful life, not to exceed five years. The Company periodically reviews capitalized
software costs for impairment where the fair value is less than the carrying value. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, $246,184 and $489,148 of internal costs were capitalized, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, $1,421,155 of software development costs was written off as impaired. 

Revenue Recognition  

Our revenue recognition
policies are in accordance with standards on software revenue recognition, which include guidance on revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables and arrangements that include the right to use of software stored on another entity s hardware. 

In the case of non-software
arrangements, we apply the guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and wherein multiple elements are allocated
to each element based on the element s relative fair value. Revenue allocated to separate elements is recognized for each
element in accordance with our accounting policies described below. If we cannot account for items included in a multiple-element
arrangement as separate units of accounting, they are combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting and generally recognized
as the undelivered items or services are provided to the customer. 

Consulting. 
We provide consulting services, primarily implementation and training services, to our clients using a time and materials pricing
methodology. The Company prices its delivery of consulting services on a time and materials basis where the customer is either
charged an agreed-upon daily rate plus out-of-pocket expenses or an hourly rate plus out-of-pocket expenses. In this case, the
Company is paid fees and other amounts generally on a monthly basis or upon the completion of the deliverable service and recognizes
revenue as the services are performed. 

Software License. 
We sell concurrent perpetual software licenses to our customers. The license gives the customer the right to use the software without
regard to a specific term. We recognize the license revenue upon execution of a contract and delivery of the software, provided
the license fee is fixed and determinable, no significant production, modification or customization of the software is required
and collection is considered probable by management. When the software license arrangement requires the Company to provide consulting
services that are essential to the functionality of the software, the product license revenue is recognized upon the acceptance
by the customer and consulting fees are recognized as services are performed. 

Software licenses are
generally sold as part of a multiple-element arrangement that may include maintenance and, under a separate agreement, consulting
services. The consulting services are generally performed by the Company, but the customer may use a third-party to perform the
consulting services. We consider these separate agreements as being negotiated as a package. The Company determines whether there
is vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (  VSOEFV  ) for each element identified in the arrangement,
to determine whether the total arrangement fees can be allocated to each element. If VSOEFV exists for each element, the total
arrangement fee is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element. In cases where there is not VSOEFV for each element,
or if it is determined that services are essential to the functionality of the software being delivered, we initially defer revenue
recognition of the software license fees until VSOEFV is established or the services are performed. However, if VSOEFV is determinable
for all of the undelivered elements, and assuming the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements, we will
defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining portion of the arrangement
value through application of the residual method. Where VSOEFV has not been established for certain undelivered elements, revenue
for all elements is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined. Evidence of VSOEFV
is determined for software products based on actual sales prices for the product sold to a similar class of customer and based
on pricing strategies set forth in the Company s standard pricing list. Evidence of VSOEFV for consulting services is based
upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for individuals expected to perform the related services. The Company
establishes VSOEFV for maintenance agreements using the percentage method such that VSOEFV for maintenance is a percentage of the
license fee charged annually for a specific software product, which in most instances is 18% of the portion of arrangement fees
allocated to the software license element. 

Maintenance Revenue. 
In connection with the sale of a software license, a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services. Most of the
customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services. These maintenance services are typically
renewed on an annual basis. We charge an annual maintenance fee, which is typically a percentage of the initial software license
fee and may be increased from the prior year amount based on inflation or other agreed upon percentage. The annual maintenance
fee generally is paid to the Company at the beginning of the maintenance period, and we recognize these revenues ratably over the
term of the related contract. 

While most of our customers
pay for their annual maintenance at the beginning of the maintenance period, a few customers have payment terms that allow them
to pay for their annual maintenance on a quarterly or monthly basis. If the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning
of the maintenance period (or at the beginning of the quarter or month for those few maintenance customers), we will ratably recognize
the maintenance revenue if management believes the collection of the maintenance fee is imminent. Otherwise, we will defer revenue
recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer. We normally continue to provide maintenance service
while awaiting payment from customers. When the payment is received, revenue is recognized for the period that revenue was previously
deferred. This may result in volatility in software maintenance revenue from period to period. 

Cloud-based offering. 
We have contracted with third parties to provide new and existing customers with hosting facilities providing all infrastructure
and allowing us to offer our currently sold software, emPath  and SnAPPnet , on a service basis. However, a contractual
right to take possession of the software license or run it on another party s hardware is not granted to the customer. We
refer to the delivery method to give functionality to new customers utilizing this service as cloud-based. Since the customer is
not given contractual right to take possession of the software, the scope of ASC 350-40 does not apply. A customer using cloud-based
software can enter into an agreement to purchase a software license at any time. We generate revenue from cloud-based offering
as the customer utilizes the software over the Internet. 

We will provide consulting
services to customers in conjunction with the cloud-based offering. The rate for such service is based on standard hourly or daily
billing rates. The consulting revenue is recognized as services are performed. Customers utilizing their own computer to access
cloud-based functionality are charged a fee equal to the number of employees paid each month multiplied by an agreed-upon rate
per employee. The revenue is recognized as the cloud-based services are rendered each month. 

Allowances for Doubtful
Accounts  

The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
additional allowances may be required. We review delinquent accounts at least quarterly to identify potential doubtful accounts,
and together with customer follow-up, estimate the amounts of potential losses. 

Deferred Taxes  

The Company records
a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized
in the foreseeable future, based on estimates of foreseeable future taxable income and taking into consideration historical operating
information. In the event management estimates that the Company will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax
assets in the foreseeable future, a valuation allowance is recorded through a charge to income in the period such determination
is made. Likewise, should management estimate that the Company will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of its net recorded assets, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination
is made. 

Stock-Based Compensation
Expense  

We account for share-based
compensation in accordance with the provisions of share-based payments, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all
stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to
vest. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the
quoted price of our common stock. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date
or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments, and are recognized as expense over the service
period. 

Valuation of the
Embedded and Warrant Derivatives  

The valuation of our
embedded derivatives is determined by using the Company s quoted stock price. An embedded derivative is a derivative instrument
that is embedded within another contract, which under a convertible note (the host contract) includes the right to convert the
note by the holder, certain default redemption right premiums and a change of control premium (payable in cash if a fundamental
change occurs). In accordance with the guidance on derivative instruments, embedded derivatives are marked-to-market each reporting
period, with a corresponding non-cash gain or loss charged to the current period. The practical effect of this has been that when
our stock price increases so does our derivative liability, resulting in a non-cash loss that reduces our earnings and earnings
per share. When our stock price declines, we record a non-cash gain, increasing our earnings and earnings per share. 

The fair value recorded
for the derivative liability varies from period to period. This variability may result in the actual derivative liability for a
period either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in significant fluctuations
in other income (expense) because of the corresponding non-cash gain or loss recorded. 

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company does not
expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company s financial
position, operations or cash flows. 

Results of Operations 

Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 Compared To Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Total Revenues.  
We had total revenues of $953,261 and $1,025,194 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease
in total revenues was $71,933 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 representing a 7.0% decrease compared to the total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Substantially all the revenues for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were related to the business operations of NOW Solutions. Revenue from SnAPPnet, Inc. was $12,440 or 1.3% of total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $22,528 or 2.2%of total revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily consist of fees derived from software licenses, consulting services, software
maintenance and cloud-based offerings. There were $7,290 of new licensing sales of our emPath  product during the third quarter
of 2016 as compared to $22,500 for the same period in 2015. Software maintenance in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
by $30,837or 3.6% from the same period in the prior year. The revenue decrease in software maintenance is related to the loss of
US maintenance revenue. Consulting revenue, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $5,564 from the same period
in the prior year, which represents a 10.1% decrease. This decrease was due to reduced consulting services for version upgrades
and enhancements to existing accounts during the third quarter of 2016. Cloud-based revenues were $75,099 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $86,417 for the same period in the prior year, representing a $11,318 decrease or 13.1%. The
decrease is related to a reduction in Canadian cloud-based revenue and SnAPPnet revenue. Other revenue in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased by $9,004 or 81.7% from the same period in the prior year. Other revenue consists primarily of reimbursable
travel expenses, currency gains and losses, and other miscellaneous revenues. 

We had total revenues
of $2,875,863 and $3,236,011 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in total revenues
was $360,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 representing a 11.1% decrease compared to the total revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Substantially all the revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
related to the business operations of NOW Solutions. Revenue from SnAPPnet, Inc. was $48,286 or 1.68% of total revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $61,966 or 1.9% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily consist of fees derived from software licenses, consulting services, software
maintenance and cloud-based offerings. The revenue from new software licenses decreased by $3,210 or 14.3% compared to that for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Software maintenance in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $292,977
or 10.7% from the same period in the prior year. The revenue decrease in software maintenance is related to the loss of US and
Canada maintenance revenue and the effects of unfavorable currency rate changes on our Canadian maintenance revenue. Consulting
revenue, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $11,179 from the same period in the prior year, which represents
a 6.0% increase. This increase was primarily due to increased consulting services for version upgrades and enhancements to existing
accounts in Canada during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cloud-based revenues were $199,565 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $248,444 for the same period in the prior year, representing a $48,879 decrease or 19.7%. The decrease
is primarily related a reduction in US cloud-based revenue and SnAPPnet revenue. Other revenue in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $26,261 or 71.3% from the same period in the prior year. Other revenue consists primarily of reimbursable
travel expenses, currency gains and losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.

  We had direct costs associated with our revenues of $392,058 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$465,614 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of revenues of $73,556 represents a 15.8% decrease.
The decrease in direct cost of revenues was primarily due to decreases in consulting fees, commissions and renegotiated hosting
fees. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, direct costs of revenues were $1,156,522 compared to $1,377,496 for the same period in 2015, resulting
in a decrease of $220,974 or 16.0%. The decrease in direct cost of revenues was primarily due to decreases in consulting fees,
commissions, travel expenses and renegotiated hosting fees. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses.   We had selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,126,309 and $563,406 in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $562,903 is 99.9% more than the same period in 2015. We
had increased salaries, stock compensation and penalties.

ended September 30, 2016 we had selling, general and administrative expenses of $2,602,957 compared to $2,124,196 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $478,761 was 22.5% higher than the same period in 2015. We had increased salaries,
stock compensation and consulting fees somewhat offset by decreased legal fees and shareholder communications. 

Depreciation
and amortization  . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had depreciation and amortization of $325 compared
to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $758 and $38,412, respectively
of depreciation and amortization was recorded. 

Bad debt expense  .
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $29,276 and $41,203, respectively was recorded for accounts receivables
that was greater than ninety days past due. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $8,927 and $59,808, respectively
was recorded for accounts receivables that was greater than ninety days past due. 

Impairment of
software costs  . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $1,421,155 of Ploinks  software development costs
was expensed as impaired as management was unable to support the net realizable value required by GAAP due to the uniqueness of
Ploinks  and lack of third-party information related to user growth rates for mobile devices  apps. Although the Company
has written these costs to expense, management will go to market with Ploinks  once the application is complete. 

Gain/Loss on
Derivative Liability .  Derivative liabilities are adjusted each quarter for changes in the market value of the Company s
common stock, common stock warrants, and convertible debentures. Market value for common stock warrants and convertible debentures
is determined using the Black-Scholes Model. The gain on derivative liabilities was $160,326 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $0 for the comparable period in 2015. The gain on derivative liabilities was $49,291 for the nine months ended

Forbearance Fees  .
Forbearance fees relate to fees charged by our lenders on loans in default. Forbearance fees for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $2,500 compared to $699,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The fees for the three months ended September
30, 2016 are related to a lender of VCSY. The fees for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are related to the fair market
value of 10 million shares of VCSY common stock with the rule 144 restrictive legend issued to a VCSY lender and 22 million shares

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are related to a VCSY lender. The fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2015

VCSY lender and 22 million shares of VCSY common stock with the rule 144 restrictive legend issued to the senior secured lenders
of NOW Solutions. 

Loss on Debt
Extinguishment  . We had a $35,969 gain on debt extinguishment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The gain relates
to the fair market value of the issuance of 5 million shares with the rule 144 restrictive legend of VCSY common stock to a NOW
Solutions lender to settle a portion of debt principal. 

We had a $173,193 and
$323,193 loss on debt extinguishment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The loss relates to the fair market
value of the issuance of 28,556,522 shares with the rule 144 restrictive legend of VCSY common stock to VCSY, NOW Solutions and
Priority Time lenders to settle debt and accrued interest payments. 

Interest Expense . 
We had interest expense of $550,189 and $64,819 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest
expense increased by $485,370 representing an increase of 748.8% compared to the same expense in the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase was due to interest and debt discounts related to the issuance of convertible debentures in 2016 and an
adjustment credit in 2015 on interest recorded in a prior year on the settlement of Canadian income taxes. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we had interest expense of $1,453,234 compared to $588,583 for the same period in 2015, representing
an increase of $864,651 or 146.9% for the period. The increase was due to interest and debt discounts related to the issuance of
convertible debentures in 2016 and an adjustment credit in 2015 on interest recorded in a prior year on the settlement of Canadian
income taxes. 

Net loss before
income taxes.   We had a net loss before income taxes of $2,408,202 and $950,664 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The net loss before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the factors
discussed above for revenues, cost of revenues, bad debt expense, impairment of software development costs and selling, general
and administrative expenses, which essentially gave us an operating loss of $2,015,862. This loss was increased by forbearance
fees and interest expense and reduced by gain on derivative liabilities. The net loss before income taxes for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 was due to the factors discussed above for revenues, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative
expenses, which essentially gave us an operating loss of $12,753. This loss was increased by forbearance fees, loss on debt extinguishment
and interest expense. 

We had a net loss before income taxes of $3,734,265 and $2,303,250 for the nine months ended September
20, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the factors
discussed above for revenues, cost of revenues, bad debt expense, impairment of software development costs and selling, general
and administrative expenses, which essentially gave us an operating loss of $2,346,732. This loss was increased by forbearance
fees and interest expense and reduced by gain on derivative liabilities and gain on debt extinguishments. The net loss before income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the factors discussed above for revenues, cost of revenues and selling,
general and administrative expenses, which essentially gave us an operating loss of $363,901. This loss was increased by forbearance
fees, loss on derivative liability, loss on debt extinguishment and interest expense. 

Income tax benefit . 
We had income tax expense of $1,154 and $103,910 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Income tax
expense is related to NOW Solutions, a 75% owned subsidiary of the Company. 

We had an income tax
benefit of $675,895 and $562,373 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The income tax benefit is
primarily related to an adjustment for the settlement of Canadian income taxes recorded in a previous year. 

Dividends Applicable
to Preferred Stock.   We have outstanding Series A 4% convertible cumulative preferred stock that accrues dividends at a
rate of 4% on a semi-annual basis. The Company also has outstanding Series C 4% convertible cumulative preferred stock that accrues
dividends at a rate of 4% on a quarterly basis. The total dividends applicable to Series A and Series C preferred stock were $147,000
for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $441,000 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.

We had a net loss attributed
to common stockholders of $4,159,401 and $2,246,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net loss

Share.   We had a net loss per share of $0.00 and $0.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2016, we had non-restricted cash-on-hand of $18,513 compared to $37,141   at
December 31, 2015.  

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $344,205 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $148,564
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we received $2,501,986 of cash from
customers, used $2,082,806 for payroll, benefits and payroll taxes, $172,618 for interest payments, $208,101 for professional
fees, $37,647 for insurance payments, $87,603 for tax payments other than payroll and $257,416 for accounts payable to vendors. 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $148,564 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $24,702
for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we received $3,485,041 of cash from
customers, used $1,925,341 for payroll, benefits and payroll taxes, $98,857 for interest payments, $378,691 for professional fees,
$96,006 for insurance payments, $215,063 for tax payments other than payroll, $79,186 for audit fees and $840,460 for accounts
payable to vendors. 

A large portion of
our cash (and revenue) comes from software maintenance. When we bill, and collect for software maintenance, we record a liability
in deferred revenue and recognize income ratably over the maintenance period. Deferred revenue decreased $357,574 or 21.6% from
the balance at December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to a higher number of customers on calendar year maintenance agreements
which results in higher deferred revenue in December. 

Our accounts receivable
trade decreased from $382,463 at December 31, 2015 to $91,048 (net of allowance for bad debts) at September 30, 2016. The decrease
is a result of seasonal fluctuations in the timing of billing for software maintenance which typically yields higher receivables
in December compared to September. 

The
accounts payable and accrued liabilities went from $10,645,353   at
December 31, 2015 to $11,740,523 at September 30, 2016. The change is primarily related to increased accounts payable, executive
payroll, payroll taxes and accrued interest, partially offset by decreased accounts payable. The resulting balance at September
30, 2016 is 127 times more than the balance in accounts receivable. This is one of the reasons why we do not have sufficient funds
available to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations under their existing terms, as described below.  

We used cash to invest
in equipment and the development of software products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 of $246,184
and $489,148, respectively. Most of the equipment was computer equipment and peripherals for upgraded network servers to increase
the productivity of our software developers, and new personal computers for developers, consultants and sales personnel. Software
development relates to the development of new products. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we had $776,900 of new debt funding, $150,000 of equity financing, repaid $241,337 to lenders and paid
$222,500 of dividends to noncontrolling shareholders of NOW Solutions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid $53,228
of principal on notes payable and related party notes payable, paid dividends of $92,500 to NOW Solutions noncontrolling interest
owners and had $885,333 of new debt funding in the same period. 

The total change in
cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a decrease of $18,628. 

As of the date of the
filing of this Report, we do not have sufficient funds available to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations under their
existing terms. Therefore, we need to raise additional funds through selling securities, obtaining loans, renegotiating the terms
of our existing debt and/or increasing sales with our new products. Our inability to raise such funds or renegotiate the terms
of our existing debt will significantly jeopardize our ability to continue operations. 

Of the notes payable,
the default status is as follows: 

The carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not purport to represent realizable or settlement values. We
had a net loss before noncontrolling interest of $3,838,175 and $1,740,877 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively and have historically incurred losses. Since December 31, 2009, we have used substantial funds in further developing
our product line and in conducting present and new operations, and we need to raise additional funds and/or generate additional
revenue through our existing businesses, including the licensing of our intellectual property, to accomplish our objectives. Additionally,
at September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of approximately $19.6 million (although this figure includes deferred
revenue of approximately $1.3 million) and have defaulted on several of our debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our management is
continuing its efforts to attempt to secure funds through equity and/or debt instruments for our operations, expansion and possible
acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and/or other business combinations. We will require additional funds to pay down our liabilities,
as well as finance our expansion plans consistent with our anticipated changes in operations and infrastructure. However, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funds and that if such funds are available, whether the terms or
conditions would be acceptable to us and whether we will be able to turn into a profitable position and generate positive operating
cash flow. The consolidated financial statements contain no adjustment for the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures     

Our management, principally
our chief executive officer (who is also currently serving as our Principal Accounting Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective such
that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure. 

Management s
annual report on internal control over financial reporting associated with our business is set forth on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, as filed on April 14, 2016. 

There have been no
material changes in our internal control over financial reporting since our reporting on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.

5.          I
have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors
and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

(a)          All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

(b)          Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
