NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Organization  
    
  BNC Bancorp (the "Company") was formed in 2002 to serve as a one-bank holding company for Bank of North Carolina (the "Bank").  The Bank is incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina and provides a wide range of banking services tailored to the particular banking needs of the communities we serve.  The Bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using those deposits, together with other funding from our lines of credit, to make commercial and consumer loans. The Bank also offers a wide range of banking services, including traditional products such as checking and savings accounts. The Bank conducts operations through   71   full-service banking offices, including   36   branches in North Carolina,   26   branches in South Carolina and   nine   branches in Virginia.  The branches in Virginia and South Carolina operate as BNC Bank. 
    
  The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank operates under the banking laws of North Carolina, and is subject to the rules and regulations of the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).  Accordingly, the Company and BNC are examined periodically by those regulatory authorities.  
    
  These consolidated financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and notes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flow activity required in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations have been made.  The information contained in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 should be referred to in connection with these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders' equity as previously reported. 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those relating to the allowance for loan losses, determination of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. 
    
  Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses.  Organizations will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances.  Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  For public companies, this ASU will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2016.  As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized excess tax benefits of   $0.3 million   in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and excess tax benefits of   $0.5 million   were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Prior periods have not been adjusted.

     Table of Contents  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which will require lessees to record an asset on the balance sheet for the right to use the leased asset and a liability for the corresponding lease obligation for leases with terms of more than 12 months.  The accounting treatment for lessors will remain relatively unchanged.  The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which revises the accounting treatment related to classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured as fair value.  Upon adoption, investments in equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method or that result in the consolidation of the investee, will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may be measured at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes from observable price changes in an orderly transaction.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of certain provisions is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805)  , which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, an acquirer will recognize measurement period adjustments during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30)  , which amends the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability.  This update affects disclosures related to debt issuance costs but does not affect existing recognition and measurement guidance for these items.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, the Company recorded debt issuance costs as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 reflects a reduction in other assets and long-term debt of   $1.2 million   related to the reclassification of debt issuance costs. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)  , which amends the consolidation analysis required under GAAP.  The revised guidance amends the consolidation analysis based on certain fee arrangements or relationships to the reporting entity and, for limited partnerships, requires entities to consider the limited partner s rights relative to the general partner.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  This ASU was developed as a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues.  The ASU s core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017).  Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  The ASU may be adopted using either a modified retrospective method or a full retrospective method.  The Company intends to adopt the ASU during the first quarter of 2018, as required, using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company's preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The FASB continues to release new accounting guidance related to the adoption of this ASU and the results of the Company's materiality analysis may change based on conclusions reached as to the application of this new guidance.

  On October 16, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of   seven   branches from CertusBank, N.A. (the "Certus branches"), pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement dated June 1, 2015.  
    
  A summary of the fair value of assets received and liabilities assumed are as follows:

None   of the goodwill associated with this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.  All goodwill related to this acquisition was allocated to the banking operations reporting unit.

     Table of Contents  

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company revised its initial estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of certain acquired loans and acquired deferred tax assets. Because such revision occurred during the first 12 months following the date of acquisition and was not the result of an event that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has increased the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of the Certus branches by   $1.7 million   to reflect this change in estimate. 
    
  Acquisition of Valley  
    
  On July 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Valley, the holding company for Valley Bank, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated November 17, 2014.  Under the merger agreement, Valley's shareholders received   1.1081   shares of the Company's voting common stock for each share of Valley common stock owned.  
    
  A summary of assets received and liabilities assumed for Valley, as well as the associated fair value adjustments, are as follows: 

Explanation of fair value adjustments: 
           (1) 
    Adjustment to reflect estimated fair value of investment securities available-for-sale.

    Adjustment to reflect estimated fair value of loans.

With this acquisition, the Company expanded its footprint into Roanoke, Virginia with the addition of   nine   branches and an experienced in-market team that enhances the Company s ability to compete in that market. The Company projects cost savings will be recognized in future periods through the elimination of redundant operations.  None of the goodwill associated with this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes.  All goodwill related to this acquisition was allocated to the banking operations reporting unit.   
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company revised its initial estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of certain acquired loans, acquired other real estate owned, acquired other assets, and acquired deferred tax assets. Because such revision occurred during the first 12 months following the date of acquisition and was not the result of an event that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company has increased the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of Valley by   $1.7 million   to reflect this change in estimate.  
    
  The Company incurred total transaction-related costs of   $2.6 million   and   $4.9 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and total transaction-related costs of   $7.8 million   and   $9.0 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Transaction-related costs, which are expensed as incurred as a component of non-interest expense, primarily include, but are not limited to, severance costs, professional services, data processing fees, and marketing and advertising expenses.  
    
  The Company has determined the above noted acquisitions each constitute a business combination as defined by FASB ASC Topic 805:   Business Combinations   ( ASC Topic 805 ), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  The Company has recorded the assets purchased and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 805.  
    
  The estimated fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information regarding closing date fair value becomes available.  During this one year period, the causes of any changes in cash flow estimates are considered to determine whether the change results from circumstances that existed at the acquisition date or if the change results from an event that occurred after the acquisition date. 

NOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and participating securities outstanding during the reporting period.  Diluted earnings per common share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares.  Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options and restricted stock awards (collectively referred to herein as  Stock Rights ).  Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share in the periods in which the effect would be anti-dilutive.   
    
  The Company's basic and diluted earnings per share calculations are presented in the following table: 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, there were no shares of Stock Rights excluded in computing diluted common shares outstanding.

NOTE 4   INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair values of investment securities are presented in the following tables: 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below.  The expected life of mortgage-backed securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans with or without call or prepayment penalties.  For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity.

The following tables detail gross unrealized losses and fair values of investment securities aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:   

The Company reviews the investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to monitor its exposure to other-than-temporary impairment. A determination as to whether a security s decline in fair value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security.  Some factors the Company may consider in the other-than-temporary impairment analysis include the length of time and extent to which the security has been in an unrealized loss position, changes in security ratings, financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, as well as security and industry specific economic conditions.  
    
  Based on this evaluation, the Company does not believe any unrealized loss at September 30, 2016 represents an other-than-temporary impairment, as these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and the current market conditions, and not credit deterioration. The Company has concluded there are no concerns about the long-term viability of the issuers of these securities and the Company currently does not intend to sell, nor does it believe that it will be required to sell, these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

NOTE 5   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  Major categories of loans are presented below: 

On May 2, 2016, the Bank entered into an agreement with the FDIC to terminate all existing loss-share agreements with the FDIC.  All rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under the FDIC loss share agreements, including the clawback provisions and the settlement of loss share and expense reimbursement claims, have been resolved and terminated under such agreement. 
    
  The Company evaluates loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration in accordance with the provisions of ASC 310-30.  Credit-impaired loans are those loans showing evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable, at the date of acquisition, the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. Generally, the acquired loans that meet the Company s definition for substandard status fall within the definition of credit-impaired covered loans.  The following table presents loans acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, at acquisition date, accounted for under ASC 310-30: 

The acquisition date unpaid balance of loans acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that did not have credit deterioration was   $348.1 million   with an estimated fair value of   $341.7 million  .  The discount will be amortized on a level-yield basis over the economic life of the loans.

The Company has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB") and from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "Federal Reserve").  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, real estate loans with carrying values of   $2.09 billion   and   $1.68 billion  , respectively, were pledged to secure borrowing facilities from these institutions. 
    
  A summary of the changes to the allowance for loan losses, by class of financing receivable, is presented below:

     Table of Contents  

(1)   
    The provision for loan losses includes the "net" provision on covered loans after coverage provided by FDIC loss-share agreements, which totaled   $0   and   $(0.4) million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this resulted in an increase in the FDIC indemnification asset of   $0.1 million  , which is the difference between the net provision on covered loans and the total reduction to the allowance for loan losses allocable to the covered loan portfolio of   $0.3 million  . 
               (2)   
    The provision for loan losses includes the "net" provision on covered loans after coverage provided by FDIC loss-share agreements, which totaled   $0.1 million   and   $(0.1) million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This resulted in a decrease in the FDIC indemnification asset of   $0.3 million   and   $1.0 million  , which is the difference between the net provision on covered loans and the total reduction to the allowance for loan losses allocable to the covered loan portfolio of   $0.5 million   and   $1.3 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

The following table presents information related to the average recorded investment and interest income recognized on impaired loans, excluding purchased impaired loans: 

For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of interest income recognized within the period that the loans were impaired was primarily related to loans modified as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") that remained on accrual status.  The amount of interest income recognized using a cash-basis method of accounting during the period that the loans were impaired was not material. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had   $0.5 million   and   $2.5 million   of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which foreclosure proceedings were in progress.

Credit Quality Indicators  
    
  The Company uses several credit quality indicators to manage credit risk in an ongoing manner.  The Company's primary credit quality indicators use an internal credit risk rating system that categorizes loans and leases into pass, special mention, or classified categories. Credit risk ratings are applied individually to those classes of loans and leases that have significant or unique credit characteristics that benefit from a case-by-case evaluation.  These are typically loans and leases to businesses or individuals in the classes which comprise the commercial portfolio segment.  Groups of loans and leases that are underwritten and structured using standardized criteria and characteristics are typically risk rated and monitored collectively.  These are typically loans and leases to individuals in the classes which comprise the consumer portfolio segment.  
    
  The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  
    
  Pass -   Loans classified as pass are considered to be a satisfactory credit risk and generally considered to be collectible in full. 
  Special Mention   - Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.  
  Substandard   - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  
  Doubtful   - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
  Loss   - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectable and are in the process of being charged-off, as soon as practicable, once so classified. 
    
  The following tables present the recorded investment in the Company s loans by credit quality indicator:

Modifications 
    
  Loan modifications are considered a TDR if concessions have been granted to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty. The concessions granted generally involve the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, which generally would not otherwise be considered. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Nonaccrual restructured loans are included and treated with all other nonaccrual loans. In addition, all accruing restructured loans are reported as TDRs, which are considered and accounted for as impaired loans. Generally, restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until the customer has attained a sustained period of repayment performance under the modified loan terms (generally a minimum of six months). However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and whether the loan should be returned to or maintained on accrual status. If the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status.  
    
  Loans modified in a TDR are, in many cases, already on nonaccrual status and partial charge-offs have in some cases already been taken against the outstanding loan balance.  As a result, loans modified in a TDR for the Company may have the financial effect of increasing the specific allowance associated with the loan.  An allowance for impaired consumer and commercial loans that have been modified in a TDR is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs, if the loan is collateral dependent.  Management exercises significant judgment in developing these estimates.  Once we classify a loan as a TDR, the loan is only removed from TDR classification under three circumstances: (1) the loan is paid off, (2) the loan is charged off or (3) if, at the beginning of the current fiscal year, the loan has performed in accordance with the modified terms for a minimum of six consecutive months and at the time of modification the loan s interest rate represented a then current market interest rate for a loan of similar risk.

     Table of Contents  

The following tables provide a summary of loans modified as TDRs: 

At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had   no   available commitments outstanding on TDRs. 
    
  The Company offers a variety of modifications to borrowers. The modification categories offered can generally be described in the following categories: 
    
  Rate modification   - A modification in which the interest rate is changed. 
    
  Term modification   - A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments or frequency of payments is changed. 
    
  Payment modification     A modification in which the principal and interest payment are lowered from the original contractual terms. 
    
  Interest only modification     A modification in which the loan is converted to interest only payments for a period of time. 
    
  Combination modification     Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above.

     Table of Contents  

The following tables present new TDRs by modification category.  All balances represent the recorded investment at the end of the period in which the modification was made. 

No loans modified and classified as TDRs in the previous twelve months defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, while loans modified and classified as TDRs in the previous twelve months and defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were immaterial.  The Company defines payment default as movement of the restructuring to nonaccrual status, foreclosure or charge-off, whichever occurs first.

  The Company originates certain single family, residential first mortgage loans for sale on a presold basis.  Loan sale activity is summarized below: 

NOTE 6   DERIVATIVES 
  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The Company does not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes. 
    
  The primary focus of the Company s asset/liability management program is to monitor the sensitivity of the Company s net portfolio value and net income under varying interest rate scenarios to take steps to control its risks.  On a quarterly basis, the Company simulates the net portfolio value and net income expected to be earned over a twelve-month period following the date of simulation.  The simulation is based on a projection of market interest rates at varying levels and estimates the impact of such market rates on the levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities during the measurement period.  Based upon the outcome of the simulation analysis, the Company considers the use of derivatives as a means of reducing the volatility of net portfolio value and projected net income within certain ranges of projected changes in interest rates.  The Company evaluates the effectiveness of entering into any derivative instrument agreement by measuring the cost of such an agreement in relation to the reduction in net portfolio value and net income volatility within an assumed range of interest rates.  The Company also has derivatives that are a result of a service it provides to certain qualifying customers, which includes a matched book of derivative instruments offered to customers in order to minimize their interest rate risk.

     Table of Contents  

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company has variable rate funding which creates exposure to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates.  The Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a notional amount of   $125 million  .  The interest rate swap was designated as a hedge against the changes in cash flows attributable to changes in one-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate being hedged, associated with the interest payments made on the first   $125 million   of the Company's variable rate money market funding arrangement.   
    
  The Company receives interest at the one-month LIBOR rate and pays a fixed interest rate under the terms of the swap agreement.  The termination date of the swap agreement is   March 18, 2019  . 
    
  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 
    
  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, which may include interest rate swaps, caps and/or floors, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure and to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract position.  These derivative positions are recorded at fair value on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and, due to the matched nature of these derivative instruments, changes in fair value do not impact the Company s earnings.  
    
  The following table presents the fair value of the Company s derivatives: 

The derivative instruments held by the Company are subject to master netting arrangements which contain a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and settle such amounts on a net basis. The Company has elected to present the financial assets and financial liabilities associated with these arrangements on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Cash collateral is posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds.  

29 

     Table of Contents  

Information about financial instruments that are eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheets is presented in the following table:  

The Company has recorded a loss of   $1.4 million  , net of tax, as component of accumulated other comprehensive income at September 30, 2016 associated with the cash flow hedging instrument and expects   $1.0 million  , net of tax, to be reclassified as an increase to interest expense during the next 12 months.   
    
  The following table presents the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income relating to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of tax: 

No amount of net losses were reclassified to earnings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
    
  The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense should the hedge no longer be considered effective.  No amount of ineffectiveness was included in net income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company will continue to assess the effectiveness of the hedge on a quarterly basis.   
    
  Counterparty Credit Risk         By entering into derivative instrument contracts, the Company exposes itself, from time to time, to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is in an asset position, the counterparty has a liability to the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. The Company attempts to minimize this risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting its exposure to any single counterparty and regularly monitoring its market position with each counterparty. 
    
  Credit-Risk Related Contingent Features     The Company s derivative instruments contain provisions allowing the financial institution counterparty to terminate the contracts in certain circumstances, such as a default by the Company on its indebtedness or the failure to maintain its regulatory status as a well-capitalized institution.  These derivative agreements also contain provisions regarding the posting of collateral by each party.  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was   $4.8 million  , for which the Company has posted collateral with a fair value of   $8.4 million  .

NOTE 7   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The following table presents activity for goodwill and other intangible assets: 

The Company has identified   two   reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment.  These reporting units are the mortgage origination unit, which originates certain single family residential first mortgage loans that are subsequently sold into the secondary market, and the banking operations unit, which contains all other activities performed by the Company.  All goodwill is allocated to the banking operations reporting unit.   
    
  The Company conducted its annual impairment testing as of June 30, 2016 utilizing a qualitative assessment.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the banking operations reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (including goodwill) of this reporting unit. Therefore, a step one quantitative analysis was not required.  There have been no impairment charges recorded on goodwill.  
    
  The following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for the Company s core deposit intangible assets, which are the only identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization:

The Company has an uncollateralized   364  -day revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) for an aggregate principal amount of up to   $25 million   at any time outstanding.  The Credit Agreement matures on   November 12, 2016   with an interest rate the greater of i)   3.25%  , ii) the Prime Rate, or iii) the Federal Funds rate, plus   0.50%  .  There were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016. 
    
  The following table presents the Company s long-term debt: 

(1)    Long-term debt balances are presented net of debt issuance costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. 
    
  The Company has   $127.0 million   of long-term advances outstanding with the FHLB as of September 30, 2016, with maturity dates ranging from   2017   to   2021   and an average interest rate of   1.95%  .  At September 30, 2016, real estate loans and investment securities with carrying values of   $1.23 billion   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, were assigned under this arrangement.   
    
  The Parent Company has issued   $60.0 million   of   5.5%   Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the "Subordinated Notes"), all of which are outstanding at September 30, 2016.  The Subordinated Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of   5.5%   per year for the first   5   years and, from October 1, 2019 to the October 1, 2024 maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then current three-month LIBOR plus   359   basis points.  The Subordinated Notes are redeemable by the Parent Company at any quarterly interest payment date beginning on October 1, 2019 to maturity at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
    
  The Company assumed a junior subordinated note in conjunction with the Valley acquisition with an outstanding balance of   $10.7 million   at September 30, 2016.  The junior subordinated note bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus   5.00%   per annum, with a floor of   5.50%   and a cap of   9.50%  , and has a maturity date of October 15, 2023.  The interest rate for the subordinated note was   5.52%   at September 30, 2016.  
    
  In addition, the Company has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve utilizing the discount window and the borrower-in-custody of collateral arrangement.  At   September 30, 2016  , commercial loans and investment securities with carrying values of   $853.9 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively, were assigned under these arrangements.  The Company had    no    outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve at September 30, 2016.

    The amortization of the unrealized holding gains in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of transfer partially offsets the amortization of the difference between the par value and fair value of the investment securities at the date of transfer. Both components are amortized as an adjustment of yield. 

NOTE 10 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  
    
  ASC Topic 820  , Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability at the measurement date. The three levels of valuations are defined as follows:  
    
  Level 1   Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
    
  Level 2   Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Level 3   Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement, and require significant management judgment or estimation using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. 
    
  Fair Value on a Recurring Basis     The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis and the following is a general description of the methods used to value such assets. 
    
  Investment securities available-for-sale     At June 30, 2016, the Company transferred   $5.4 million   of equity securities available-for-sale from Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy to Level 1, as the Company concluded the trading volume for these securities has increased and the Company believes there is now an active market for determining the fair value of identical securities.  The Company now classifies the entire equity securities portfolio as Level 1 valuation.  The fair value of the remainder of our investment securities available-for-sale are determined by a third-party pricing service.  The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data obtained from market research publications. The valuation of mortgage-backed securities also includes new issue data, monthly payment information and  To Be Announced  prices.  The valuation of state and municipal securities also include the use of material event notices.  We review the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness.  At least annually, we will validate prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparing to prices obtained from a second third-party source.  The Company classifies these investment securities as Level 2 valuation.    
    
  Derivative assets and liabilities     The values of derivative instruments held or issued by the Company for risk management purposes are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For those derivatives, the Company measures fair value using models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities, and include the value associated with counterparty credit risk. The Company classifies derivative instruments as Level 2 valuation.    
    
  The following tables present information about certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

35 

     Table of Contents  

Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis     The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and the following is a general description of the methods used to value such assets.    
    
  Loans held for sale     Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value. The fair value of loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Company classifies loans subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2 valuation.   
    
  Impaired loans     The Company considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement, including both principal and interest. Management has determined that nonaccrual loans and loans that have had their terms restructured in a TDR meet this impaired loan definition. For individually evaluated impaired loans, the amount of impairment is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans, which the Company classifies as a Level 3 valuation. 
    
  OREO     OREO is initially recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.  Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral, which the Company classifies as a Level 3 valuation.

Estimated fair values of financial instruments have been estimated by the Company using the provisions of ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments   ( ASC 825 ), which requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. 
    
  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments.  ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

  Investment securities held-to-maturity   - The fair value of our investment securities held-to-maturity are determined by a third-party pricing service.  The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service for state and municipal securities are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and the use of material event notices.   
    
  We review the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness.  At least annually, we will validate prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparing to prices obtained from a second third-party source. 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank stock   - The fair value for FHLB stock is its carrying value, since this is the amount for which it could be redeemed. There is no active market for this stock and the Company, in order to be a member of the FHLB, is required to maintain a minimum investment. 
    
  Loans receivable, net   - The fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and credit ratings for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for the allowance for loan losses. 
    
  FDIC indemnification asset   - The fair value for the FDIC indemnification asset is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using current discount rates.  
    
  Investment in bank-owned life insurance   - The carrying value of life insurance approximates fair value because this investment is carried at cash surrender value, as determined by the insurer. 
    
  Accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable   - The carrying amount of accrued interest is assumed to approximate fair value. 
    
  Deposits   - The fair values disclosed for deposits with no stated maturity (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for deposits with a stated maturity date (time deposits) are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on these accounts to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. 
    
  Short-term borrowings   - The carrying amount of short-term borrowings is assumed to approximate fair value. 
    
  Long-term debt     The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates for similar debt over the same remaining term. 

NOTE 11   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unfunded lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Company's risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitment to extend credit, lines of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments under such instruments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  The amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's evaluation of the borrower.  Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, real estate and time deposits with financial institutions.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent cash requirements.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents the outstanding off-balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk: 

We invest as a limited partner in partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing or invest in emerging companies in our geographic region.  These limited partnership structures are considered to be variable interest entities ("VIEs") because the limited partners with equity at risk do not have substantive kick-out rights through voting rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner.  As a limited partner, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and do not consolidate them.  Our investments in these partnerships are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company has commitments to invest up to   $18.3 million   in these VIEs, of which   $12.9 million   was unfunded at September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, our maximum exposure to loss was our   $4.5 million   recorded investment. 
    
  The Company is subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted.   Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation pending or threatened against the Company will be material to the Company s consolidated financial position.  On an on-going basis the Company assesses any potential liabilities or contingencies in connection with such legal proceedings.  For those matters where it is deemed probable that the Company will incur losses and the amount of the losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company would record an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements.   

NOTE 12   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
    
  The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors may grant or award eligible participants stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or any combination of awards (collectively referred to herein as  Rights ).  At September 30, 2016, the Company had Rights outstanding from the 2006 BNC Bancorp Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan (the "2006 Omnibus Plan"), the BNC Bancorp 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "2013 Omnibus Plan") and the KeySource Non-Statutory and Incentive Stock Option plans (the "KeySource Plans").  The 2013 Omnibus Plan and the KeySource Plans are the only plans that are available for future grants.  The Company had   118,000   Rights issued under the 2006 Omnibus Plan,   457,679   Rights issued and   731,205   Rights available for grants or awards under the 2013 Omnibus Plan, and   56,537   stock options issued and   35,607   stock options available for issuance related to the KeySource Plans. 
    
  Stock Option Awards  .  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the expected life at the time of grant.  Volatility is based on the average volatility of the Company based upon previous trading history.  The expected life and forfeiture assumptions are based on historical data.  Dividend yield is based on the yield at the time of the option grant.   
    
  A summary of the Company s stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below: 

The related compensation expense recognized for stock options, the intrinsic value of stock option exercised and the grant-date fair value of options that vested was immaterial for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

Restricted Stock Awards.    A summary of the activity of the Company s unvested restricted stock awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below: 

The Company measures the fair value of restricted shares based on the price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, and compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period.  The Company recognized compensation expense of   $2.4 million   and   $2.0 million   for restricted stock awards for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $6.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock granted under the plans.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.91 years  .  The grant-date fair value of restricted stock grants vested was   $1.7 million   and   $1.5 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 13   SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
    
  On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of High Point Bank Corporation ("High Point"), the holding company for High Point Bank and Trust Company, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated November 16, 2015.

  Overview and Executive Summary 
    
  BNC Bancorp was formed in 2002 to serve as the holding company for Bank of North Carolina.  We provide a wide range of banking services tailored to the particular banking needs of the communities we serve.  We are principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using those deposits, together with other funding from our lines of credit, to make primarily consumer and commercial loans.  We have pursued a strategy that emphasizes our local affiliations and are continuously developing new and innovative products and equipping our bankers with new technology to further differentiate us as a community bank with sophisticated product delivery.   
    
  During recent years, we have focused much of our growth and expansion efforts on acquisitions of community banks that align with our strategy of growth focused within existing markets.  These acquisitions have allowed us to increase our presence and build scale in these key metropolitan markets and have enhanced our organic growth opportunities.  In June 2016, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Southcoast, which operated 10 full-service branches in and around Charleston, South Carolina.  In addition, on November 1, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of High Point Bank Corporation ("HPTB"), the holding company for High Point Bank and Trust.  HPTB operated 10 full-service branches in the Piedmont-Triad area of North Carolina, which is another key market for our growth strategy.  As this transaction was completed subsequent to September 30, 2016, none of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed or results of operations for HPTB are included in the financial information as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Analysis of Results of Operations 
    
  Net Interest Income  
    
  Net interest income is the primary source of BNC s revenue.  Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities.  Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, repricing frequencies, and loan prepayment behavior.  To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt loans and investment securities is computed on a fully-taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis.  Net interest income and net interest margin are discussed on a FTE basis.  
    
  Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $57.6 million, an increase of 19.7% from $48.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily driven by a $1.21 billion increase in average interest-earning assets, primarily due to the acquisition of Southcoast, as well as continued organic loan growth in our markets.  The Company has also increased its on-balance sheet liquidity position, which led to an increase in average investment securities and interest-bearing deposits at other financial institutions of $196.7 million and $79.6 million, respectively. 

45 

     Table of Contents  

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $159.9 million, an increase of 24.2% from $128.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Average interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $5.44 billion, an increase of $1.38 billion from average interest-earning assets of $4.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due to the acquisitions of Valley, the Certus branches, and Southcoast, respectively, along with continued significant increases in loan originations. 
    
  Net interest margin was 3.91% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 19 basis points from 4.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company s average yield on interest-earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.56%, a decrease of 14 basis points from 4.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the yield earned on portfolio loans, which was 4.71% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 4.83% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in yield on portfolio loans was due to continued pricing pressure on new and renewed portfolio loans.  The Company recorded accretion income on the acquired loan portfolio of $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 20.9% compared to $4.8 million of accretion earned during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The average yield earned on the investment securities portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.39%, a slight decrease from 4.46% earned for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was due to the purchase of new investment securities that have a lower yield than the current portfolio.  
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest margin was 3.92%, a decrease of 32 basis points from 4.24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company s average yield on interest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.57%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to 4.87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The yield earned on portfolio loans was 4.75% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 22 basis points compared to 4.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company recorded accretion income on the acquired loan portfolio of $16.6 million, an increase from $14.9 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The average yield earned on the investment securities portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.25%, a decrease of 52 basis points from 4.77% earned for the comparable period of 2015.  
    
  Average interest-bearing liabilities were $4.80 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $923.1 million compared to $3.87 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was fully attributable to interest-bearing deposits, which have come from both acquisitions and organic growth in our markets.  The Company s average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.80% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.72% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Average interest-bearing liabilities were $4.48 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.07 billion from $3.40 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Total interest-bearing deposits were $4.19 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.06 billion from $3.13 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These increases were due to the acquisitions of Valley, the Certus branches, and Southcoast, respectively.  The Company s average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.78% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a slight increase compared to 0.75% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

  Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase compared to $0.2 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $3.2 million, an increase compared to $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The additional provision was recorded due to the continued high levels of growth in the originated loan portfolio.  
    
  The amount of provision for loan losses is based on our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses utilizing the criteria discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  Non-Interest Income 

Mortgage lending income was $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a slight increase compared to $3.0 million earned during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold $84.4 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market, compared with $99.8 million for the comparable period of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, mortgage lending income was $8.5 million, an increase compared to $8.3 million earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The Company sold $254.3 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $261.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Income from service charges was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase from $2.3 million earned during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income from service charges was $7.4 million, an increase of 28.7% from $5.7 million earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was directly due to the increase in deposits and volume of transactions from the Company's recent acquisitions and organic growth.    
    
  Other non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.7 million, an increase of 16.6% compared to $2.4 million earned during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Many of the non-interest income sources, such as income from recoveries on acquired loans and income derived from our investment brokerage services, are volatile and can vary significantly from period to period.  Income generated from the sale of the guaranteed-portion of SBA loans was $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 77.6% from $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, SBA sale income was $2.8 million, an increase of 93.4% compared to $1.4 million for the comparable period of 2015, as the Company continues to place emphasis on expanding this business.

  Non-Interest Expense 

Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes $2.6 million of transaction-related expenses, compared to $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Excluding these transaction-related expenses, the overall increase in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was directly attributable to increased headcount and facilities charges from our acquisitions of Southcoast and the Certus branches, respectively.   
    
  The overall increase in non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was directly attributable to increased headcount and facilities charges from our acquisitions of Valley, Southcoast and the Certus branches, respectively.  Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $7.8 million of transaction-related expenses, compared to $9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
    
  Other expenses totaled $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other non-interest expense was $13.8 million, an increase of 19.0% compared to $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes $0.8 million of loss on the early extinguishment of debt.  Excluding this charge, non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively.  The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 2015, were primarily due to increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets and miscellaneous additional increases due to the Company's growth. 
    
  Loan, foreclosure and other real estate owned ("OREO") expenses include foreclosure and carrying costs and realized losses and write-downs of foreclosed properties.  Realized losses and valuation adjustments on foreclosed property totaled $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, realized losses and valuation adjustments totaled $0.5 million, compared to $4.4 million recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During 2015, the Company initiated an aggressive disposition strategy by writing down targeted OREO in order to sell these properties. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense was $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 44.7% from $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  We generate significant amounts of non-taxable income from tax-exempt investment securities and from investments in bank-owned life insurance, which can significantly impact our effective income tax rate.  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 28.9%, compared to an effective tax rate of 30.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was due to a decrease in our state income tax rate and income tax benefits realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09.

     Table of Contents  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our income tax expense and effective income tax rate were $20.6 million and 30.4%, respectively, compared to $13.3 million and 29.6%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   This increase was primarily due to an increase in our level of taxable income relative to non-taxable income, which was slightly offset by the income tax benefits realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-09.   
    
  Additional information regarding the adoption of ASU 2016-09 is included in Note 1  Basis of Presentation  to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report.

  Investment Securities 
    
  Our investment securities portfolio is intended to provide us with adequate liquidity, flexibility in asset/liability management, a source of stable income, and is structured with minimum credit exposure.  Investment securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet, while investment securities classified as held to maturity are shown at amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheet.  Our total investment securities portfolio had a carrying value of $838.3 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $734.6 million at December 31, 2015.  
    
  We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed.  These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories.  
    
  Our investment securities portfolio included gross unrealized gains of $24.0 million and gross unrealized losses of $2.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to gross unrealized gains of $18.6 million and gross unrealized losses of $5.1 million at December 31, 2015.  Management believes that all of its unrealized losses on individual investment securities at September 30, 2016 are the result of fluctuations in interest rates and do not reflect deterioration in the credit quality of these investments.  Accordingly, management considers these unrealized losses to be temporary in nature.  We do not have the intent to sell these investment securities with unrealized losses and, more likely than not, will not be required to sell these investment securities before fair value recovers to amortized cost. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, our investment securities portfolio included 389 taxable and tax-exempt debt instruments issued by various U.S. states, counties, cities, municipalities and school districts.  The Company continually assesses the risk of credit default for the municipal bond portfolio and believes the portfolio has a low risk of credit default.  The following table is a summary, by U.S. state, of our investment in the obligations of state and political subdivisions at September 30, 2016:

  Obligations of State and Political Subdivisions 

Our largest exposure in general obligation bonds was 74 bonds issued by various school districts in Texas with a total amortized cost basis of $91.8 million and total fair value of $95.9 million at September 30, 2016.  Of this total, $76.0 million in amortized cost and $79.1 million in fair value are guaranteed by the Permanent School Fund of the State of Texas.   
    
  Our investments in revenue bonds at September 30, 2016 are summarized in the following table: 
    
  Table 8 
  Revenue Bonds by Source 

Our largest individual exposures in revenue bonds at September 30, 2016 were three bonds to be repaid by future pledged power and utility revenue, and seven bonds to be repaid by future pledged revenues generated from a leading academic healthcare system.  The total amortized cost for these 10 securities was $18.1 million and the total fair value was $19.1 million at September 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents  

All of our investments in state and political subdivisions are rated A- or higher by nationally recognized ratings agencies and are subject to an initial pre-purchase credit assessment and ongoing monitoring. The factors considered in this analysis include capacity to pay, market and economic data, soundness of budgetary position and/or assets collateralizing the securities, sources, strength, and stability of tax or enterprise revenue, review of the credit rating, as provided by one or more nationally recognized credit ratings agencies, as well as any other factors as are available and relevant to the security or issuer.  While we do not place sole reliance on the credit rating of the security, no investment in a state or political subdivision is considered for purchase unless it has an investment grade credit rating by one or more nationally recognized credit ratings agencies.  We perform additional detailed risk analysis should any security be downgraded below investment grade to determine if the security should be retained or sold.  This risk analysis includes, but is not limited to, discussions with third party credit analysts and review of any changes that may affect the credit worthiness of the issuer and its ability to make timely principal and interest payments. 
    
  Our evaluation of investments in state and political subdivisions at September 30, 2016 did not uncover any facts or circumstances resulting in significantly different credit ratings than those assigned by nationally recognized credit ratings agencies.  
    
  The Company's investment securities portfolio also includes 42 asset-backed securities, which are collateralizations of student loan pools, securitizations of cash flows derived single family rental properties, and collateralized loan obligations, which are pools of non-investment grade corporate loans.  Our investments in asset-backed securities at September 30, 2016 are summarized in the following table: 
    
  Table 9 
  Asset-Backed Securities 

The Company s investment in asset-backed securities is part of a larger balance sheet strategy to increase on-balance sheet liquidity with securities that complement the duration and interest rate risk profile of the investment securities portfolio.  While we do not place sole reliance on the credit rating of a security, all of the Company's asset-backed securities are rated AA or higher by nationally recognized credit ratings agencies.  Ongoing analysis of these securities is performed to monitor overall creditworthiness of the issuer and likelihood of timely principal and interest payments.  
    
  Our evaluation of investments in asset-backed securities at September 30, 2016 did not uncover any facts or circumstances resulting in significantly different credit ratings than those assigned by nationally recognized credit ratings agencies.  
    
  Loans 
    
  Total portfolio loans were   $5.00 billion   at September 30, 2016, an increase of $796.1 million from   $4.20 billion   at December 31, 2015.  The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within our core footprint.  Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions.

  Loan Portfolio Composition 

(1)    Amount includes $0 and $40.9 million of acquired loans covered under FDIC loss-share agreements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Notable contributions to the change in loan balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

The commercial construction portfolio totaled $442.2 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $77.2 million from December 31, 2015.  Excluding loans acquired in business combinations, commercial construction loans were $355.0 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $73.4 million from December 31, 2015.  Fundings of commercial construction projects have increased significantly during 2016 and our portfolio includes projects that span multiple industries and locations within our footprint, with the primary components being multi-family, office buildings, and shopping center construction projects; and

At September 30, 2016, second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit for which the Company did not own or service the related first mortgage loans totaled approximately $251.4 million, which represented approximately 94% of the total second liens held by the Company.  Since substantially all first mortgage loans originated by the Company are eligible for sale in the secondary market, and the Company typically does not service the related first mortgage loans if they are sold, the Company may be unable to track the delinquency status of the related first mortgage loans and whether such loans are at risk of foreclosure by others.  The Company monitors the increased credit risk associated with second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit for which the Company does not own or service the related first mortgage loans as part of the overall management of the relationship.  If the Company identifies significant deterioration in a borrower s credit quality, the Company may freeze the borrower s ability to make additional principal draws under the home equity lines of credit. 
    
  Home equity lines of credit are offered as  revolving  lines of credit which have a 15-year maturity and draw period.  Borrowers are able to choose scheduled monthly interest-only payments during the term of the line or monthly payments of 1.5% of the outstanding principal, along with associated interest.  The full principal amount is due at maturity as a lump-sum balloon payment under the interest-only payment option.  At September 30, 2016, approximately 95% of the home equity lines of credit were paying scheduled monthly interest-only payments.  At maturity, home equity loans are re-underwritten based on our current underwriting standards and updated appraisals are obtained.  Our underwriting criteria include analysis of the loan amount in relation to the borrower's total mortgage debt, in addition to normal credit underwriting guidelines.  If the borrower qualifies under our current underwriting standards, the loans are either converted to conventional second mortgage loans that are fully amortizing or refinanced along with the existing first mortgage into a new first mortgage loan.  Borrowers may be required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal balance to qualify for such renewals.   
    
  The following table summarizes the maturity dates of our home equity lines of credit at September 30, 2016: 
    
  Table 11 
  Home Equity Line of Credit Maturities 

Deposits 
    
  We provide a range of deposit services, including non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand and savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits.  These accounts generally pay interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits.  Deposits continue to be our primary funding source.  Total deposits at September 30, 2016 were $  5.65 billion  , an increase of 19.1% from total deposits of $4.74 billion at December 31, 2015.  Wholesale deposits comprised 27.5% of total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  The increased level of wholesale funding will be used to repay term wholesale deposits that will be maturing early in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Borrowings    
    
  The total carrying value of our outstanding borrowings was $310.6 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $19.0 million compared to total carrying value of borrowings of $291.6 million at December 31, 2015.  Short-term borrowings are comprised of short-term FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal funds purchased.  Many short-term funding sources, particularly Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, are expected to be reissued and, therefore, do not represent an immediate need for cash.  Long-term funding is comprised of long-term FHLB advances and subordinated notes.  The additional borrowings were comprised of junior subordinated debentures and long-term advances from the FHLB assumed in the Southcoast acquisition.

Asset Quality 
    
  We consider asset quality to be of primary importance, and employ a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to our lending policy as approved by our Board of Directors.  It is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated.  The Company's internal credit risk review function, through focused review and sampling, validates the accuracy of commercial loan  risk grades.  Each loan risk grade corresponds to an estimated default probability.  In addition, as a given loan's credit quality improves or deteriorates, the Company will update the borrower's risk grade accordingly.  The function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system.  In determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings, particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process.  Consideration is also given to historical loan loss experience, the value and adequacy of collateral, economic conditions in our market area and other factors.  For loans determined to be impaired, the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans.  This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.  The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Our policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge-off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review.  Further efforts are then pursued through various means available.  Loans carried in a nonaccrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses.  
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past due and OREO, totaled $45.1 million, or 0.66% of total assets, at September 30, 2016, a decrease compared to $51.3 million, or 0.90% of total assets, at December 31, 2015.  Nonperforming assets that were not acquired by the Company totaled $21.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $22.2 million at December 31, 2015.  
    
  The following table summarizes total nonperforming assets for the past five quarters: 
    
  Table 12 
  Nonperforming Assets 

57 

     Table of Contents  

Total nonaccrual loans were $17.0 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease from total nonaccrual loans of $18.7 million at December 31, 2015.  Nonaccrual loans that were not acquired by the Company increased from $6.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $7.7 million at September 30, 2016 due to a small number of larger dollar relationships being reclassified to nonaccrual.  
    
  Total OREO was $28.0 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $4.5 million from total OREO of $32.6 million at December 31, 2015.  OREO properties that were not acquired by the Company were $13.4 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2015.  The carrying values of OREO represent the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  
    
  TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.  Nonaccrual TDRs are included in nonaccrual loans, whereas accruing TDRs are excluded from nonaccrual loans as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected.  We accrue interest on TDRs at the restructured interest rate when management anticipates that no loss of original principal will occur.  
    
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on loans, unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis.  We account for loans on a nonaccrual basis when we have serious doubts about the ability to collect principal or interest in full.  Loans are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than ninety (90) days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection.  Amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected.  
    
  Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The allowance for loan losses was $36.4 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $4.7 million compared to $31.6 million at December 31, 2015.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total portfolio loans was 0.73% and 0.75% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Excluding loans acquired by the Company, the ratio of the allowance for loans to portfolio loans was 0.97% and 1.05% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The allowance for loan losses was equal to 213.7% of our total nonperforming loans and leases at September 30, 2016, compared to 169.1% at December 31, 2015. 
    
  The Company experienced $0.7 million of net recoveries on previous charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net recoveries of $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Gross charge-offs were $0.9 million during the third quarter of 2016, compared to gross charge-offs of $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced $1.5 million in net recoveries of previously charged-off loans, compared to net recoveries of $0.8 million for the comparable period of 2015.  Gross charge-offs were $2.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The following table presents information related to the allowance for loan losses for the periods presented: 
    
  Table 13 
  Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses   

The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business.  We make specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics, as discussed below.  While management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.

Capital Resources 
       
  Total shareholders  equity was $795.2 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of 34.3% from shareholders  equity of $592.1 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the issuance of 2.9 million shares of voting common stock during the third quarter of 2016, as well as 4.3 million shares issued as consideration in the acquisition of Southcoast. 
    
  We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action prescribe specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.  We use our capital primarily for our lending activities as well as acquisitions and expansions of our business and other operating requirements. 
     
  The Bank and the Company's capital levels are characterized as "well-capitalized" under the Basel III Capital Rules.  The capital adequacy ratios for BNC and the Company are set forth below: 
    
  Table 14 
  Capital Adequacy Ratios 

Liquidity 
    
  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that the Company has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost-effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they fall due, including the ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, invest in subsidiaries or acquisitions, and satisfy other operating requirements.  In addition to satisfying cash flow requirements in the ordinary course of business, the Company actively monitors and manages its liquidity position to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet cash flow requirements in adverse situations.  
  The Company also has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility.  In July 2016, the Company deregistered approximately $29.2 million in unsold securities from its prior shelf registration statement.  The Company also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which the Company may, from time to time, offer senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, convertible debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants or units.  On July 26, 2016, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 2.9 million shares of voting common stock, which yielded net proceeds of $59.6 million, under the universal shelf registration statement.  
    
  While dividends from BNC and proceeds from issuance of capital are primary funding sources for the Parent Company, these sources could be limited or costly (such as by regulation or subject to the capital needs of its subsidiaries or by market appetite for bank holding company securities).  The Parent Company did not receive dividends from subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  BNC has $160.0 million of established federal funds and other unsecured lines with counterparty banks, with full availability to these lines at September 30, 2016.  BNC also has the ability to borrow from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, with $735.9 million and $280.6 million, respectively, in available credit at September 30, 2016.  BNC also has excess loan and investment securities collateral which could be pledged to secure additional deposits or to counterparty banks, the FHLB or other parties as necessary.

Investment securities are an important tool to the Company s liquidity objective.  Of the $838.3 million in the Company's investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2016, $543.0 million are designated as available-for-sale.  Some of these securities are pledged to secure collateralized deposits, borrowings and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.  The remaining investment securities could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary.  The Bank may also issue institutional certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities was $  50.5 million   and $  574.6 million  , respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $  516.0 million  , for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $  109.1 million   since December 31, 2015.  The primary cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the funding the Company's continued organic loan growth, the purchase of investments, which includes both investment securities and bank-owned life insurance, and the repayment of short-term borrowings.  The primary cash inflows related to cash received from core operations, cash received from our acquisition of Southcoast, cash received from the issuance of common stock, and increased deposits. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating and financing activities was $46.3 million and $189.2 million, respectively, while net cash used in investing activities was $250.2 million, for a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $14.7 million since December 31, 2014.  The primary cash outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the increase in loans, purchases of investment securities, and the repayment of short-term borrowings, while the primary cash inflows related to cash received from core operations, increases in deposits, and cash received from acquisitions. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  As described in more detail in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, asset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, liquidity and funding.  While the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Company s asset/liability management policies, BNC s Asset and Liability Committee monitors loan, investment, and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk and adherence to BNC s policies.   
    
  The Company has not experienced any material change in the risk of its portfolios of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  See Note 6  Derivatives  to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for more information on the Company s strategies to hedge its interest rate risk. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required under Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the foregoing, its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  No changes were made to the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  WHEREAS, capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning given to such terms in the Plan. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows: 
  1.  Date of Award  . The date of grant of the Award under this Agreement is September 20, 2016, the date that the Award was approved by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable. 
    
  2.  Award of Plan Shares  . The Participant is awarded an RSU Award for an aggregate of 6,000 shares (the    Plan Shares   ) of Common Stock, which Plan Shares may become vested and nonforfeitable as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement.

  3.  Representations, Warranties and Transfer Restrictions  . 
    
  (a)  Representations and Warranties  . Participant makes and agrees to the representations and warranties, if any, attached hereto as Annex A.  The Committee may cause a legend to be placed on any certificate representing any of the Plan Shares to make appropriate reference to restrictions on transfer, as necessary. 
    
  (b)  Securities Law and Regulations.   The Participant agrees that the Plan Shares shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system upon which the Common Stock is then listed and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any certificate representing any of the Plan Shares to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 
    
  (c)  Other Transfer Restrictions  . No portion of the Award or Plan Shares granted hereunder may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by Participant until such portion of the Plan Shares shall become fully vested in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement. 
    
  4.  Vesting and Delivery of Plan Shares  . 
    
  (a)  Vesting Schedule  . Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, the Award and related Plan  
  Shares shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth herein: 

(ii) 
    In the event that the Participant terminates service as a director prior to vesting of all or a portion of the Plan Shares, the Award shall terminate with respect to such unvested Plan Shares, and such unvested Plan Shares shall be forfeited to the Company without the payment of any consideration therefor, and the Participant shall have no rights with respect thereto.  
       
           (iii) 
    The impact, if any, on vesting due to a Change in Control is governed by Section 10 of the Plan.   
       
  (b)  Delivery of Vested Plan Shares to the Participant  . The Award, if earned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be payable in whole shares of Common Stock.  The total number of Plan Shares that may be acquired upon vesting of the Award (or portion thereof) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.  A certificate or certificates for the Plan Shares subject to the Award or portion thereof shall be issued in the name of the Participant or his or her beneficiary (or, in the case of uncertificated shares, other written evidence of ownership in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations shall be provided) as soon as practicable after, and only to the extent that, the Award or portion thereof has vested and is distributable.  The Plan Shares (or any other benefit subject to the Award) shall, upon vesting of the Award be issued and distributed to the Participant (or his or her beneficiary) no later than the later of (a) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third month following the Participant s first taxable year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or (b) the fifteenth (15th) day of the third month following the end of the Company s first taxable year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or otherwise in accordance with Code Section 409A.  The parties agree to execute any further instrument and to take such action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. 
    
  5.  Shareholder Rights  . The Participant shall not be deemed to be the holder of any Plan Shares subject to the Award and shall not have any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder unless and until (and then only to the extent that) the Award or portion thereof has vested and certificates for such Plan Shares have been issued and delivered to him or her; provided, however, that if the Company pays a dividend on the Common Stock at any time after the Effective Date, the Company shall credit to the Participant an amount equal to (a) the per share dividend paid by the Company on the Common Stock, multiplied by (b) the number of unvested Plan Shares, to the extent that the Award has not been forfeited by the Participant on such dividend payment date.  Such amount shall be payable to the Participant within thirty (30) days of such dividend payment date but in no event later than the calendar year in which the dividend is declared and paid.  Dividends payable on vested Plan Shares shall be paid by the Company in accordance with the Company s dividend payment practices.  
    
  6.  Designation of Beneficiary  . The Participant hereby designates the person(s) described on Annex B as the beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be entitled to receive the vested Plan Shares and other assets, if any, distributable to the Participant upon his or her Death.  The Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his or her beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior beneficiary, if any, by filing a new designation with the Committee. The last such designation received by the Committee shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant s Death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. 
    
  If no such beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of the Participant s Death, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Participant, or if such designation conflicts with law, the Participant s estate shall be deemed to have been designated his beneficiary and shall receive the vested Plan Shares and other assets, if any, distributable to the Participant upon his Death.  If the Committee is in doubt as to the right of any person to receive such distribution, the Committee may direct the Bank to retain the vested Plan Shares and other assets, without liability for any interest in respect thereof, until the rights thereto are determined, or the Committee may direct the transfer of such Plan Shares into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such transfer shall be deemed a complete discharge of the obligations of the Bank, the Company and the Committee hereunder. 
  7.  Effect of Award on Status of Participant  . The fact that an Award has been made to the Participant under this Plan shall not confer on the Participant any right to continued service on the boards of directors of the Bank, the Company or an Affiliate thereof, nor shall it limit the right of the Bank, the Company or any Affiliate or its or their shareholders to remove the Participant from any such boards. 
    
  8.  Impact of Award on Other Benefits of Participant  . The value of the Plan Shares on the date of the Award or at the time the Plan Shares become vested shall not be includable as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other benefit plan offered to directors by the Bank, the Company or any subsidiary thereof, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
    
  9.  Tax and Tax Withholding  . Participant has reviewed with Participant s own tax and financial advisors the federal, state and local tax consequences of this Agreement and receipt of the Plan Shares.  The Participant acknowledges that the Company shall require the Participant to pay the Company the amount of any tax or other amount, if any, required by any governmental  

authority to be withheld and paid over by the Company to such authority for the account of the Participant, and the Participant agrees, as a condition to the grant of the Award and delivery of the Plan Shares or any other benefit, to satisfy such obligations.  In satisfaction of such or other taxes, all vested Plan Shares distributed pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to withholding by the Company to cover any applicable taxes up to the maximum statutory tax rate (unless the Committee determines otherwise).  The Participant expressly acknowledges and agrees to such withholding without regard to whether the Plan Shares may then be sold or otherwise transferred by the Participant.  The number of Plan Shares to be withheld shall have a fair market value as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined as nearly equal as possible to (but not exceeding) the amount of such obligations being satisfied.   
    
  10.  Notices  . Any notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if delivered personally or three business days after deposit in the United States mail by Certified Mail, return receipt requested, properly addressed and postage prepaid, if to the Company, the Bank or the Committee, at the Company s principal office address at 3980 Premier Drive, High Point, North Carolina 27265; and, if to the Participant, at his or her last address appearing on the books of the Company or the Bank.  The Company and the Participant may change their address or addresses by giving written notice of such change as provided herein. Any notice or other communication hereunder shall be deemed to have been given on the date actually delivered or as of the third (3rd) business day following the date mailed as set forth above, as the case may be. 
    
  11.  Construction Controlled by Plan  . The Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex C, is incorporated herein by reference.  The Award and Plan Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the Participant hereby assumes and agrees to comply with all of the obligations imposed upon the Participant in the Plan.  This Agreement shall be construed so as to be consistent with the Plan; and the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be controlling in the event that any provision hereof should appear to be inconsistent therewith. 
    
  12.  Severability  . Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and enforceable under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal, the validity of any other provision or part thereof shall not be affected thereby and this Agreement shall continue to be binding on the parties hereto as if such unenforceable, invalid or illegal provision or part thereof had not been included herein. 
    
  13.  Governing Law  . Without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws, the laws of the State of North Carolina shall govern and control the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement. 
    
  14.  Modification of Agreement; Waiver  . This Agreement may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated, and any terms, representations or conditions may be waived, but only by a written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto or their successors in interest.  No waiver hereunder shall constitute a waiver with respect to any subsequent occurrence or other transaction hereunder or of any other provision hereof. 
    
  15.  Binding Effect  . This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective heirs, legatees, personal representatives, executors, and administrators, successors and assigns. 
    
  16.  Entire Agreement  . This Agreement and the Plan constitute and embody the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto and, except as otherwise provided hereunder; there are no other agreements or understandings, written or oral, in effect between the parties hereto relating to the matters addressed herein. 
    
  17.  Counterparts  . This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  (b)    Participant has received a copy of the Plan and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts the Award and Plan Shares subject to all of the terms and provisions of the Plan except as otherwise specifically stated in this Agreement.  Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Plan.  Participant acknowledges that the Plan Shares may only be transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to (i) a registration statement on Form S-8 upon delivery of a resale prospectus to the recipient of the Plan Shares, as long as Participant is an affiliate of the Company, (ii) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the    Act   ), or (iii) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Act.

Participant agrees to hold the Company and its directors, officers, agents and controlling persons and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns harmless and to indemnify them from and against all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of any misrepresentation made by Participant contained herein or any sale or distribution by Participant in violation of the Securities Laws. 
  (f)    Participant represents that the receipt of the Award and Plan Shares by Participant will not result in the violation by Participant of any law, statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or governmental authority to or by which Participant is bound, including, without limitation, United States laws and other laws that may be applicable to Participant and will not conflict with, or result in a material breach or violation of, any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under, any material lease, loan agreement, mortgage, security agreement, trust indenture or other agreement or instrument to which Participant is a party or by which Participant is bound or to which Participant s material properties or assets is subject, nor result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any of the material properties or assets of Participant. 
  (g)    Participant acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Participant any right with respect to continuation of service to the Company or the Bank, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her right or the Company s or the Bank s right to terminate his service to the Company or the Bank at any time, with or without cause. 
  (h)    Participant hereby accepts this Agreement subject to all of the terms and provisions hereof.  Participant has reviewed this Agreement in its entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Agreement.
