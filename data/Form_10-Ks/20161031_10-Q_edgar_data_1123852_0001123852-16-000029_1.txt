NSP-MINNESOTA AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (UNAUDITED) 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), the financial position of NSP-Minnesota and its subsidiaries as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  ; the results of its operations, including the components of net income and comprehensive income, for the   three and nine   months ended   Sept. 30, 2016   and   2015  ; and its cash flows for the   nine months ended     Sept. 30, 2016   and   2015  .  All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed.  Management has also evaluated the impact of events occurring after   Sept. 30, 2016   up to the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.  These statements contain all necessary adjustments and disclosures resulting from that evaluation.  The   Dec. 31, 2015   balance sheet information has been derived from the audited   2015   consolidated financial statements included in the NSP-Minnesota Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   Dec. 31, 2015  .  These notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included in the NSP-Minnesota Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   Dec. 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on Feb. 22, 2016.  Due to the seasonality of NSP-Minnesota s electric and natural gas sales, interim results are not necessarily an appropriate base from which to project annual results. 

1. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  The significant accounting policies set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the NSP-Minnesota Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,   2015  , appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of accounting policies and are incorporated herein by reference. 

2. 
    Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  Recently Issued 
    
  Revenue Recognition         In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued   Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09)  , which provides a framework for the recognition of revenue, with the objective that recognized revenues properly reflect amounts an entity is entitled to receive in exchange for goods and services.  The new guidance also includes additional disclosure requirements regarding revenue, cash flows and obligations related to contracts with customers.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2017.  NSP-Minnesota is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Presentation of Deferred Taxes     In November 2015, the FASB issued   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, Topic 740 (ASU No 2015-17)  , which eliminates the requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent on the balance sheet based on the classification of the related asset or liability, and instead requires classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.  This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  Other than the prescribed classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent, NSP-Minnesota does not expect the implementation of ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments     In January 2016, the FASB issued   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Subtopic 825-10 (ASU No. 2016-01)  , which among other changes in accounting and disclosure requirements, replaces the cost method of accounting for non-marketable equity securities with a model for recognizing impairments and observable price changes, and also eliminates the available-for-sale classification for marketable equity securities.  Under the new guidance, other than when the consolidation or equity method of accounting is utilized, changes in the fair value of equity securities are to be recognized in earnings.  This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2017.  NSP-Minnesota is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

Leases     In February 2016, the FASB issued   Leases, Topic 842 (ASU No. 2016-02)  , which, for lessees, requires balance sheet recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases.  Additionally, for leases that qualify as finance leases, the guidance requires expense recognition consisting of amortization of the right-of-use asset as well as interest on the related lease liability using the effective interest method.  This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.  NSP-Minnesota is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.   
    
  Stock Compensation     In March 2016, the FASB issued   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, Topic 718 (ASU 2016-09),   which amends existing guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting and presentation for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures, as well as presentation in the statement of cash flows.  This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  NSP-Minnesota does not expect the implementation of ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Recently Adopted 
    
  Consolidation         In February 2015, the FASB issued   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, Topic 810 (ASU No. 2015-02)  , which reduces the number of consolidation models and amends certain consolidation principles related to variable interest entities.  NSP-Minnesota implemented the guidance on Jan. 1, 2016, and other than the classification of certain real estate investments held within the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust as non-consolidated variable interest entities, the implementation did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs         In April 2015, the FASB issued   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, Subtopic 835-30 (ASU No. 2015-03)  , which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, instead of presentation as an asset.  NSP-Minnesota implemented the new guidance as required on Jan. 1, 2016, and as a result,   $36.9 million   of deferred debt issuance costs were presented as a deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016, and   $37.7 million   of such deferred costs were retrospectively reclassified from other non-current assets to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of Dec. 31, 2015.  
    
  Fair Value Measurement         In May 2015, the FASB issued   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), Topic 820 (ASU No. 2015-07),   which eliminates the requirement to categorize fair value measurements using a net asset value (NAV) methodology in the fair value hierarchy.  NSP-Minnesota implemented the guidance on Jan. 1, 2016, and the implementation did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  For related disclosures, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

    Income Taxes 
       
  Except to the extent noted below, Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,   2015   appropriately represents, in all material respects, the current status of other income tax matters, and are incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  Federal Tax Loss Carryback Claims     In 2012-2015, NSP-Minnesota identified certain expenses related to 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 that qualify for an extended carryback beyond the typical   two  -year carryback period.  As a result of a higher tax rate in prior years, NSP-Minnesota recognized a tax benefit of approximately   $5 million   in 2015,   $17 million   in 2014,   $12 million   in 2013 and   $15 million   in 2012. 
    
  Federal Audit     NSP-Minnesota is a member of the Xcel Energy affiliated group that files a consolidated federal income tax return.  In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced an examination of tax years   2010 and 2011  , including the   2009   carryback claim.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , the IRS had proposed an adjustment to the federal tax loss carryback claims that would result in   $14 million   of income tax expense for the 2009 through 2011 claims, the 2013 through 2014 claims, and the anticipated claim for 2015.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the IRS forwarded the issue to the Office of Appeals (Appeals).  In 2016 the IRS audit team and Xcel Energy presented their cases to Appeals; however, the outcome and timing of a resolution is uncertain.  The statute of limitations applicable to Xcel Energy s   2009   through 2011 federal income tax returns, following extensions, expires in June 2017.  Xcel Energy has recognized its best estimate of income tax expense that will result from a final resolution of the IRS s proposed adjustment of the carryback claims. In the third quarter of 2015, the IRS commenced an examination of tax years   2012 and 2013  .  As of Sept. 30, 2016, the IRS had not proposed any material adjustments to tax years 2012 and 2013. 
    
  State Audits     NSP-Minnesota is a member of the Xcel Energy affiliated group that files consolidated state income tax returns.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , NSP-Minnesota s earliest open tax year that is subject to examination by state taxing authorities under applicable statutes of limitations is   2009  .  In June 2016, the state of Minnesota began an audit of years   2010 through 2014  .  As of Sept. 30, 2016, Minnesota had not proposed any adjustments, and there were no other state income tax audits in progress. 
    
  Unrecognized Tax Benefits     The unrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions, which if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate (ETR).  In addition, the unrecognized tax benefit balance includes temporary tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  A change in the period of deductibility would not affect the ETR but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. 
    
  A reconciliation of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows: 

9 

     Table of Contents  

The unrecognized tax benefit amounts were reduced by the tax benefits associated with net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards.  The amounts of tax benefits associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards are as follows: 

It is reasonably possible that NSP-Minnesota s amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months as the IRS Appeals and audit progress, the Minnesota audit progresses, and other state audits resume.  As the IRS Appeals and IRS and Minnesota audits progress, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefit could decrease up to approximately   $32 million  . 
    
  The payable for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is partially offset by the interest benefit associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards.  The payables for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits at   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015   were not material.    No   amounts were accrued for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of   Sept. 30, 2016   or Dec. 31,   2015  .

    Rate Matters 
       
  Except to the extent noted below, the circumstances set forth in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,   2015   and in Note 5 to NSP-Minnesota s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of other rate matters, and are incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings   Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) 
    
  Minnesota 2016 Multi-Year Electric Rate Case     In November 2015, NSP-Minnesota filed a   three  -year electric rate case with the MPUC.  The rate case is based on a requested return on equity (ROE) of   10.0 percent   and a   52.50 percent   equity ratio.  The request is detailed in the table below: 

In December 2015, the MPUC approved interim rates for 2016.  
    
  Settlement Agreement 
  In August 2016, NSP-Minnesota reached a settlement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce (DOC), Xcel Large Industrials, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Group, the Suburban Rate Authority, the City of Minneapolis, the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Group, and the Energy CENTS Coalition, which resolves all revenue requirement issues in dispute.  The settlement agreement requires the approval of the MPUC.  
    
  Key terms of the settlement are listed below: 
              
    The stated revenue increases in the table below are based on the DOC s sales forecast; 
                
    Annual sales true-up to weather-normalized actuals all years, all classes: 
                 
    2016-2019 full decoupling for decoupled classes (residential, non-demand metered commercial) with   3 percent    and 
                  
    The nuclear related costs in this rate case will not be considered provisional; 
                
    Continued use of all existing riders during the   four  -year term, however no new riders or legislative additions would be utilized during the   four  -year term;  
                 
    A   four  -year stay out provision for rate cases.

(b)   
    The table reflects the estimated rate impact of this agreement, using NSP-Minnesota s original sales forecast as filed in the Minnesota rate case.  The settlement agreement includes a provision to true-up estimated sales to the actual sales for 2016. 
       
  The revised schedule for the Minnesota rate case is listed below: 

A current liability that is consistent with the settlement and represents NSP-Minnesota s best estimate of a refund obligation for 2016 associated with interim rates was recorded as of Sept. 30, 2016. 
    
  NSP-Minnesota   Gas Utility Infrastructure Costs (GUIC) Rider         In August 2016, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota s request to recover approximately   $15.5 million   in natural gas infrastructure costs through the GUIC Rider, based on NSP-Minnesota s proposed capital structure and a ROE of   9.64 percent  .  Recovery was approved for the   15  -month period from January 2016 to March 2017.  
    
  Annual Automatic Adjustment (AAA) of Charges     In June 2016, the DOC recommended the MPUC should hold utilities responsible for incremental costs of replacement power incurred due to unplanned outages at nuclear facilities under certain circumstances.  The DOC s recommendation could impact replacement power cost recovery for the Prairie Island (PI) nuclear facility outages allocated to the Minnesota jurisdiction during the AAA fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.  NSP-Minnesota expects a MPUC decision in mid-2017. 
    
  Nuclear Project Prudence Investigation     In 2013, NSP-Minnesota completed the Monticello life cycle management (LCM)/extended power uprate (EPU) project.  The multi-year project extended the life of the facility and increased the capacity from   600   to   671   megawatts (MW) in 2015.  The Monticello LCM/EPU project expenditures were approximately   $665 million  .  Total capitalized costs were approximately   $748 million  , which includes allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  In 2008, project expenditures were initially estimated at approximately   $320 million  , excluding AFUDC. 
    
  In 2013, the MPUC initiated an investigation to determine whether the final costs for the Monticello LCM/EPU project were prudent. In March 2015, the MPUC voted to allow for full recovery, including a return, on   $415 million   of the total plant costs (inclusive of AFUDC), but only allow recovery of the remaining   $333 million   of costs with no return on this portion of the investment over the remaining life of the plant.  As a result of these determinations, Xcel Energy recorded an estimated pre-tax loss of   $129 million   in the first quarter of 2015, after which the remaining book value of the Monticello project represented the present value of the estimated future cash flows. 
    
  Pending Regulatory Proceedings   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
    
  Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) ROE Complaints/ROE Adder     In November 2013, a group of customers filed a complaint at the FERC against MISO transmission owners (TOs), including NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  The complaint argued for a reduction in the ROE in transmission formula rates in the MISO region from   12.38 percent   to   9.15 percent  , a prohibition on capital structures in excess of   50 percent   equity, and the removal of ROE adders (including those for regional transmission organization (RTO) membership and for being an independent transmission company), effective Nov. 12, 2013. 
    
  In December 2015, an ALJ initial decision recommended the FERC approve a ROE of   10.32 percent  , which the FERC upheld in an order issued on Sept. 28, 2016.  This ROE is applicable for the   15   month refund period from Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and prospectively from the date of the FERC order.  The total prospective ROE is   10.82 percent  , which includes a previously approved   50   basis point adder for RTO membership.

     Table of Contents  

In February 2015, a second complaint seeking to reduce the MISO region ROE from   12.38 percent   to   8.67 percent   prior to any adder was filed, which the FERC set for hearings, resulting in a second period of potential refund from Feb. 12, 2015 to May 11, 2016.  The MPUC, the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission and the DOC joined a joint complainant/intervenor initial brief recommending an ROE of approximately   8.81 percent  .  FERC staff recommended a ROE of   8.78 percent  .  The MISO TOs recommended a ROE of   10.92 percent  .  On June 30, 2016, the ALJ recommended a ROE of   9.7 percent  , the midpoint of the upper half of the discounted cash flow range.  A FERC decision is expected in 2017.  
    
  As of Sept. 30, 2016, NSP-Minnesota has recognized a current liability for the Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015 complaint period based on the   10.32 percent   ROE provided in the FERC order, as well as a current liability representing the best estimate of the final ROE for the second complaint period.

     Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Except to the extent noted below and in Note 5 above, the circumstances set forth in Notes 10, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the NSP-Minnesota Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   Dec. 31, 2015  , and in Note 6 to NSP-Minnesota s Quarterly Reports on the Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of commitments and contingent liabilities, and are incorporated herein by reference. The following include commitments, contingencies and unresolved contingencies that are material to NSP-Minnesota s financial position. 
    
  Purchased Power Agreements (PPAs) 
    
  Under certain PPAs, NSP-Minnesota purchases power from independent power producing entities for which NSP-Minnesota is required to reimburse natural gas or biomass fuel costs, or to participate in tolling arrangements under which NSP-Minnesota procures the natural gas required to produce the energy that it purchases.  These specific PPAs create a variable interest in the associated independent power producing entity. 
    
  NSP-Minnesota had approximately   1,069   MW of capacity under long-term PPAs as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , with entities that have been determined to be variable interest entities.  NSP-Minnesota has concluded that these entities are not required to be consolidated in its consolidated financial statements because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities  economic performance.  These agreements have expiration dates through   2028  . 
    
  Guarantees 
    
  Under NSP-Minnesota s railcar lease agreement, accounted for as an operating lease, NSP-Minnesota guarantees the lessor proceeds from sale of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will at least equal the guaranteed residual value.  The guarantee issued by NSP-Minnesota has a stated maximum amount; however, NSP-Minnesota expects sale proceeds to exceed the guaranteed amount.  This lease agreement expires in   2019  . 
    
  The following table presents the guarantee issued and outstanding for NSP-Minnesota: 

Environmental Contingencies 
    
  Fargo, N.D. Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Site     In May 2015, underground pipes, tars and impacted soils were discovered in a right-of-way in Fargo, N.D. that appeared to be associated with a former MGP operated by NSP-Minnesota or prior companies.  NSP-Minnesota removed impacted soils and other materials from the right-of-way at that time and commenced an investigation of the historic MGP and adjacent properties (the Fargo MGP Site).  Based on the investigation that concluded in the third quarter of 2016, NSP-Minnesota has recommended that targeted source removal of impacted soils and historic MGP infrastructure should be performed, subject to further input from the North Dakota Department of Health, the City of Fargo, N.D., current property owners and other stakeholders.

NSP-Minnesota has initiated insurance recovery litigation in North Dakota.  The U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota agreed to the parties  request for a stay of the litigation until November 2016 to allow NSP-Minnesota time to investigate site conditions.  NSP-Minnesota intends to seek an additional stay of the litigation. 
    
  As of Sept. 30, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2015, NSP-Minnesota had recorded a liability of   $12.2 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively, for the Fargo MGP Site, with the increase due to the remediation activities proposed by NSP-Minnesota.  In December 2015, the NDPSC approved NSP-Minnesota s request to defer costs associated with the Fargo MGP Site, resulting in deferral of all investigation and response costs with the exception of   12 percent   allocable to the Minnesota jurisdiction.  Uncertainties related to the liability recognized include obtaining access and approvals from stakeholders to perform the proposed remediation and the potential for contributions from entities that may be identified as potentially responsible parties. 
    
  Environmental Requirements 
    
  Water and Waste 
  Coal Ash Regulation     NSP-Minnesota s operations are subject to federal and state laws that impose requirements for handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste.  In April 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule regulating the management and disposal of coal combustion byproducts (coal ash) as a nonhazardous waste.  Under the final rule, NSP-Minnesota s costs to manage and dispose of coal ash has not significantly increased.   
    
  In 2015, industry and environmental non-governmental organizations sought judicial review of the final rule.  In June 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order remanding and vacating certain elements of the rule as a result of partial settlements with these parties.  Oral arguments are expected to be heard in early 2017 and a final decision is anticipated in the first half of 2017.  Until a final decision is reached in the case, it is uncertain whether the litigation or partial settlements will have any significant impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows on NSP-Minnesota. 
    
  Air 
  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)     CSAPR addresses long range transport of particulate matter and ozone by requiring reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) from utilities in the eastern half of the United States, including Minnesota using an emissions trading program.  
    
  CSAPR was adopted to address interstate emissions impacting downwind states  attainment of the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and the 1997 and 2006 particulate NAAQS.  As the EPA revises the NAAQS, it will consider whether to make any further reductions to CSAPR emission budgets and whether to change which states are included in the emissions trading program.  In December 2015, the EPA proposed adjustments to CSAPR emission budgets which address attainment of the more stringent 2008 ozone NAAQS.  The EPA adopted a final rule in September 2016 for the ozone season emission budget for NOx which did not impact NSP-Minnesota. 
    
  Implementation of the NAAQS for SO   2      The EPA adopted a more stringent NAAQS for SO   2    in 2010.  The EPA is requiring states to evaluate areas in   three   phases.  If an area is designated as nonattainment, the states will need to evaluate all SO   2    sources in the area.  The state would then submit an implementation plan, which would be due in   18   months, designed to achieve the NAAQS within   five   years.  It is anticipated the areas near NSP-Minnesota s power plants will be evaluated in the next designation phase, ending December 2017.  NSP-Minnesota s King and Sherco plants already utilize scrubbers to control SO   2    emissions.  NSP-Minnesota cannot evaluate the impacts until the designation of nonattainment areas is made, and any required state plans are developed.  NSP-Minnesota believes that should SO   2    control systems be required for a plant, compliance costs or the costs of alternative cost-effective generation will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms and therefore does not expect a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Legal Contingencies 
    
  NSP-Minnesota is involved in various litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Management maintains accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.  Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.  In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.  For current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on NSP-Minnesota s financial statements.  Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.

    Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments 
       
  Short-Term Borrowings 
    
  Money Pool     Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries have established a money pool arrangement that allows for short-term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries.  Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market-based interest rates; however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc.  Money pool borrowings for NSP-Minnesota were as follows:

Commercial Paper     NSP-Minnesota meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under its credit facility.  Commercial paper outstanding for NSP-Minnesota was as follows: 

Letters of Credit     NSP-Minnesota uses letters of credit, generally with terms of   one year  , to provide financial guarantees for certain operating obligations.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  , there were   $11 million   and   $18 million  , respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.  The contract amounts of these letters of credit approximate their fair value and are subject to fees.

     Table of Contents  

Credit Facility     In order to use its commercial paper program, NSP-Minnesota must have a credit facility in place at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper borrowing limit and cannot issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding available credit facility capacity.  The line of credit provides short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks, letters of credit and back-up support for commercial paper borrowings. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , NSP-Minnesota had the following committed credit facility available (in millions of dollars): 

(b)   
    Includes outstanding letters of credit. 
       
  All credit facility bank borrowings, outstanding letters of credit and outstanding commercial paper reduce the available capacity under the credit facility.  NSP-Minnesota had   no   direct advances on the credit facility outstanding at   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  . 
    
  Amended Credit Agreements   - In June 2016, NSP-Minnesota entered into an amended five-year credit agreement with a syndicate of banks.  The total borrowing limit under the amended credit agreement remained at   $500 million  .  The amended credit agreement has substantially the same terms and conditions as the prior credit agreement with the following exceptions: 
              
    The Eurodollar borrowing margins on these lines of credit were reduced to a range of     75 to 150 basis points per year, from a range of 87.5 to 175 basis points per year,     based upon applicable long-term credit ratings.    
                
    The commitment fees, calculated on the unused portion of the lines of credit, were reduced to a range of 6 to 22.5 basis points per year, from a range of 7.5 to 27.5 basis points per year, also based on applicable long-term credit ratings.   
       
  NSP-Minnesota has the right to request an extension of the revolving credit facility termination date for two additional one-year periods, subject to majority bank group approval. 
    
  Long-Term Borrowings 
    
  In May 2016, NSP-Minnesota issued   $350 million   of   3.6 percent   first mortgage bonds due   May 15, 2046  .

    Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
       
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures     provides a single definition of fair value and requires certain disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  A hierarchical framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance.  The three levels in the hierarchy are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices. 
    
  Level 2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, or priced with models using highly observable inputs. 
    
  Level 3   Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those valued with models requiring significant management judgment or estimation. 
    
  Specific valuation methods include the following: 
    
  Cash equivalents       The fair values of cash equivalents are generally based on cost plus accrued interest; money market funds are measured using quoted prices. 

15 

     Table of Contents  

Investments in equity securities and other funds         Equity securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets.  The fair values for commingled funds, international equity funds, private equity investments and real estate investments are measured using a NAV methodology, which takes into consideration the value of underlying fund investments, as well as the other accrued assets and liabilities of a fund, in order to determine a per-share market value.  The investments in commingled funds and international equity funds may be redeemed for NAV with proper notice.  Proper notice varies by fund and can range from daily with   one   or two days notice to annually with   90   days notice.  Private equity investments require approval of the fund for any unscheduled redemption, and such redemptions may be approved or denied by the fund at its sole discretion.  Unscheduled distributions from real estate investments may be redeemed with proper notice, which is typically quarterly with   45  -  90   days notice; however, withdrawals from real estate investments may be delayed or discounted as a result of fund illiquidity.   
    
  Investments in debt securities         Fair values for debt securities are determined by a third party pricing service using recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities. 
    
  Interest rate derivatives       The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on broker quotes that utilize current market interest rate forecasts. 
    
  Commodity derivatives         The methods used to measure the fair value of commodity derivative forwards and options utilize forward prices and volatilities, as well as pricing adjustments for specific delivery locations, and are generally assigned a Level 2.  When contractual settlements extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges or quoted by brokers, the significance of the use of less observable forecasts of long-term forward prices and volatilities on a valuation is evaluated, and may result in Level 3 classification. 
    
  Electric commodity derivatives held by NSP-Minnesota include transmission congestion instruments, referred to as financial transmission rights (FTRs).  FTRs purchased from a RTO are financial instruments that entitle or obligate the holder to monthly revenues or charges based on transmission congestion across a given transmission path.  The value of an FTR is derived from, and designed to offset, the cost of energy congestion, which is caused by transmission load and transmission constraints.  Congestion is also influenced by the operating schedules of power plants and the consumption of electricity.  Unplanned plant outages, scheduled plant maintenance, changes in the costs of fuels used in generation, weather and changes in demand for electricity can each impact the operating schedules of the power plants and the value of an FTR.  NSP-Minnesota s valuation process for FTRs utilizes complex iterative modeling to predict the impacts of forecasted changes in these drivers of transmission system congestion on the historical pricing of FTR purchases. 
    
  If forecasted costs of electric transmission congestion increase or decrease for a given FTR path, the value of that particular FTR instrument will likewise increase or decrease.  Given the limited observability of management s forecasts for several of the inputs to this complex valuation model fair value measurements for FTRs have been assigned a Level 3.  Monthly settlements for non-trading FTRs are included in fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms, and therefore changes in the fair value of the yet to be settled portions of most FTRs are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  Given this regulatory treatment and the limited magnitude of NSP-Minnesota s FTRs relative to its electric utility operations, the numerous unobservable quantitative inputs to the complex model used for valuation of FTRs are insignificant to the consolidated financial statements of NSP-Minnesota. 
    
  Non-Derivative Instruments Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Nuclear Decommissioning Fund 
    
  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires NSP-Minnesota to maintain a portfolio of investments to fund the costs of decommissioning its nuclear generating plants.  Together with all accumulated earnings or losses, the assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are legally restricted for the purpose of decommissioning the Monticello and PI nuclear generating plants.  The fund contains cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities and other investments   all classified as available-for-sale.  NSP-Minnesota plans to reinvest matured securities until decommissioning begins.  NSP-Minnesota uses the MPUC approved asset allocation for the escrow and investment targets by asset class for both the escrow and qualified trust.

     Table of Contents  

NSP-Minnesota recognizes the costs of funding the decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants over the lives of the plants, assuming rate recovery of all costs.  Realized and unrealized gains on fund investments over the life of the fund are deferred as an offset of NSP-Minnesota s regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning costs, given the purpose and legal restrictions on the use of nuclear decommissioning fund assets.  Consequently, any realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund, including any other-than-temporary impairments, are deferred as a component of the regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning. 
    
  Unrealized gains for the nuclear decommissioning fund were   $355.3 million   and   $328.8 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  , respectively, and unrealized losses and amounts recorded as other-than-temporary impairments were   $65.8 million   and   $100.2 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following tables present the cost and fair value of NSP-Minnesota s non-derivative instruments with recurring fair value measurements in the nuclear decommissioning fund at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  :

  Derivative Instruments Fair Value Measurements 
    
  NSP-Minnesota enters into derivative instruments, including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options, for trading purposes and to manage risk in connection with changes in interest rates, utility commodity prices and vehicle fuel prices. 
    
  Interest Rate Derivatives     NSP-Minnesota enters into various instruments that effectively fix the interest payments on certain floating rate debt obligations or effectively fix the yield or price on a specified benchmark interest rate for an anticipated debt issuance for a specific period.  These derivative instruments are generally designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , accumulated other comprehensive losses related to interest rate derivatives included   $0.8 million   of net losses expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the related hedged interest rate transactions impact earnings, including forecasted amounts for any unsettled hedges, as applicable. 
    
  Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk     NSP-Minnesota conducts various wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and energy-related instruments.  NSP-Minnesota s risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives     NSP-Minnesota enters into derivative instruments to manage variability of future cash flows from changes in commodity prices in its electric and natural gas operations, as well as for trading purposes.  This could include the purchase or sale of energy or energy-related products, natural gas to generate electric energy, natural gas for resale, FTRs, vehicle fuel, and weather derivatives. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , NSP-Minnesota had various vehicle fuel contracts designated as cash flow hedges extending through December 2016.  NSP-Minnesota also enters into derivative instruments that mitigate commodity price risk on behalf of electric and natural gas customers but are not designated as qualifying hedging transactions.  Changes in the fair value of non-trading commodity derivative instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.  The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms.  NSP-Minnesota recorded immaterial amounts to income related to the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges for the   three and nine   months ended   Sept. 30, 2016   and 2015. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , net losses related to commodity derivative cash flow hedges recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses included immaterial net losses expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged transactions occur. 
    
  Additionally, NSP-Minnesota enters into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes not directly related to commodity price risks associated with serving its electric and natural gas customers.  Changes in the fair value of these commodity derivatives are recorded in electric operating revenues, net of amounts credited to customers under margin-sharing mechanisms.

    Amounts are recorded to operating and maintenance (O M) expenses. 
               (c)   
    Amounts are recorded to electric operating revenues.  Portions of these gains and losses are subject to sharing with electric customers through margin-sharing mechanisms and deducted from gross revenue, as appropriate. 
               (d)   
    Amounts are recorded to electric fuel and purchased power.  These derivative settlement gains and losses are shared with electric customers through fuel and purchased energy cost-recovery mechanisms, and reclassified out of income as regulatory assets or liabilities, as appropriate. 
               (e)   
    Amounts are recorded to cost of natural gas sold and transported.  These derivative settlement gains and losses are shared with natural gas customers through purchased natural gas cost-recovery mechanisms, and reclassified out of income as regulatory assets or liabilities, as appropriate. 
       
  NSP-Minnesota had   no   derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges during the   three and nine   months ended   Sept. 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Therefore,   no   gains or losses from fair value hedges or related hedged transactions were recognized for these periods. 
    
  Consideration of Credit Risk and Concentrations     NSP-Minnesota monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its interest rate derivatives and commodity derivative contracts prior to settlement, and assesses each counterparty s ability to perform on the transactions.  Given this assessment, as well as an assessment of the impact of NSP-Minnesota s own credit risk when determining the fair value of derivative liabilities, the impact of considering credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of unsettled commodity derivatives presented in the consolidated balance sheets. 

21 

     Table of Contents  

NSP-Minnesota employs additional credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures.  Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. 
    
  NSP-Minnesota s most significant concentrations of credit risk are contracts with counterparties to its wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity and transmission activities.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   five   of NSP-Minnesota s   10   most significant counterparties for these activities, comprising   $20.5 million   or   25 percent   of this credit exposure, had investment grade credit ratings from Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, Moody s Investor Services or Fitch Ratings.    Four   of the   10   most significant counterparties, comprising   $15.1 million   or   18 percent   of this credit exposure, were not rated by these agencies, but based on NSP-Minnesota s internal analysis, had credit quality consistent with investment grade.  The remaining most significant counterparty, comprising   $0.6 million   or   1 percent   of this credit exposure, had credit quality less than investment grade, based on ratings from internal analysis.    Nine   of these significant counterparties are municipal or cooperative electric entities, or other utilities. 
    
  Credit Related Contingent Features     Contract provisions for derivative instruments that NSP-Minnesota enters into, including those recorded to the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, as well as those accounted for as normal purchase-normal sale contracts and therefore not reflected on the balance sheet, may require the posting of collateral or settlement of the contracts for various reasons, including if NSP-Minnesota is unable to maintain its credit ratings.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , there were   no   derivative instruments in a liability position that would have required the posting of collateral or settlement of applicable outstanding contracts if the credit ratings of NSP-Minnesota were downgraded below investment grade. 
    
  Certain derivative instruments are also subject to contract provisions that contain adequate assurance clauses.  These provisions allow counterparties to seek performance assurance, including cash collateral, in the event that NSP-Minnesota s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations is reasonably expected to be impaired.  NSP-Minnesota had   no   collateral posted related to adequate assurance clauses in derivative contracts as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements     The following table presents for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, NSP-Minnesota s derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   Sept. 30, 2016  :

(a)   
    In 2003, as a result of implementing new guidance on the normal purchase exception for derivative accounting, NSP-Minnesota began recording several long-term PPAs at fair value due to accounting requirements related to underlying price adjustments.  As these purchases are recovered through normal regulatory recovery mechanisms in the respective jurisdictions, the changes in fair value for these contracts were offset by regulatory assets and liabilities.  During 2006, NSP-Minnesota qualified these contracts under the normal purchase exception.  Based on this qualification, the contracts are no longer adjusted to fair value and the previous carrying value of these contracts will be amortized over the remaining contract lives along with the offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities. 
               (b)   
    NSP-Minnesota nets derivative instruments and related collateral in its consolidated balance sheet when supported by a legally enforceable master netting agreement, and all derivative instruments and related collateral amounts were subject to master netting agreements at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , derivative assets and liabilities include   no   obligations to return cash collateral and the rights to reclaim cash collateral of   $2.8 million  .  The counterparty netting amounts presented exclude settlement receivables and payables and non-derivative amounts that may be subject to the same master netting agreements.

NSP-Minnesota recognizes transfers between levels as of the beginning of each period.  There were   no   transfers of amounts between levels for derivative instruments for the   three and nine   months ended Sept. 30, 2016 and 2015.  
    
  Fair Value of Long-Term Debt

    Amounts reflect the classification of debt issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt.  See Note 2,   Accounting Pronouncements   for more information on the adoption of ASU 2015-03. 
       
  The fair value of NSP-Minnesota s long-term debt is estimated based on recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities.  The fair value estimates are based on information available to management as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  , and given the observability of the inputs to these estimates, the fair values presented for long-term debt have been assigned a Level 2.

    Segment Information 
       
  Operating results from the regulated electric utility and regulated natural gas utility are each separately and regularly reviewed by NSP-Minnesota s chief operating decision maker.  NSP-Minnesota evaluates performance based on profit or loss generated from the product or service provided.  These segments are managed separately because the revenue streams are dependent upon regulated rate recovery, which is separately determined for each segment. 
    
  NSP-Minnesota has the following reportable segments: regulated electric utility, regulated natural gas utility and all other. 

NSP-Minnesota s regulated electric utility segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity primarily in portions of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.  In addition, this segment includes sales for resale and provides wholesale transmission service to various entities in the United States.  Regulated electric utility also includes NSP-Minnesota s commodity trading operations. 
                
    NSP-Minnesota s regulated natural gas utility segment transports, stores and distributes natural gas primarily in portions of Minnesota and North Dakota. 
                
    Revenues from operating segments not included above are below the necessary quantitative thresholds and are therefore included in the all other category.  Those primarily include appliance repair services, nonutility real estate activities and revenues associated with processing solid waste into refuse-derived fuel. 
       
  Asset and capital expenditure information is not provided for NSP-Minnesota s reportable segments because as an integrated electric and natural gas utility, NSP-Minnesota operates significant assets that are not dedicated to a specific business segment, and reporting assets and capital expenditures by business segment would require arbitrary and potentially misleading allocations which may not necessarily reflect the assets that would be required for the operation of the business segments on a stand-alone basis.

     Table of Contents  

To report income from operations for regulated electric and regulated natural gas utility segments, the majority of costs are directly assigned to each segment.  However, some costs, such as common depreciation, common O M expenses and interest expense are allocated based on cost causation allocators.  A general allocator is used for certain general and administrative expenses, including office supplies, rent, property insurance and general advertising. 

(b)   
    Operating revenues include an immaterial amount of affiliate gas revenue for the   three months ended Sept. 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Item 2       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Discussion of financial condition and liquidity for NSP-Minnesota is omitted per conditions set forth in general instructions H (1) (a) and (b) of Form 10-Q for wholly owned subsidiaries.  It is replaced with management s narrative analysis of the results of operations set forth in general instructions H (2) (a) of Form 10-Q for wholly owned subsidiaries (reduced disclosure format). 
    
  Financial Review 
    
  The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on NSP-Minnesota s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future.  It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements.  Due to the seasonality of NSP-Minnesota s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Except for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed herein, are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Such forward-looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   objective,   outlook,   plan,   project,   possible,   potential,   should  and similar expressions.  Actual results may vary materially.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking information.  The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other securities filings (including NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 June 30, 2016), could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: general economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures and the ability of NSP-Minnesota and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry; including the risk of a slow down in the U.S. economy or delay in growth, recovery, trade, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies in areas where NSP-Minnesota has a financial interest; customer business conditions; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by NSP-Minnesota and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; cyber security threats and data security breaches; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership or impose environmental compliance conditions; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; financial or regulatory accounting policies imposed by regulatory bodies; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; availability of cost of capital; and employee work force factors. 

Results of Operations 
    
  NSP-Minnesota s net income was approximately   $379.4 million   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with approximately   $256.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The impact of the 2015 Monticello LCM/EPU project loss along with higher electric revenues, primarily due to an interim electric rate increase in Minnesota (subject to refund), and non-fuel riders were partially offset by higher depreciation, O M expenses, interest charges and property taxes.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Monticello LCM/EPU project loss.  
    
  Electric Revenues and Margin 
    
  Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have minimal impact on electric margin.  The following table details the electric revenues and margin:

  Natural Gas Revenues and Margin 
    
  Total natural gas expense tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases.  However, due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.

Non-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items 
    
  O M Expenses         O M expenses   increased   $  37.9 million  , or   4.1 percent  , for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily due to additional maintenance activities as well as interchange agreement billings with NSP-Wisconsin related to projects placed in service, which were partially offset by lower nuclear costs. 
    
  Conservation Program Expenses     Conservation program expenses   increased     $17.8 million   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to more customer participation in the programs which has led to additional customer rebates and increased program implementation costs.  Higher conservation program expenses are generally offset by higher revenues. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization         Depreciation and amortization expense   increased     $88.7 million  , or   25.1 percent  , for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to capital investments, including Pleasant Valley and Border Wind Farms, reduction of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota and the full amortization of the DOE settlement in 2015. 
    
  Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes)         Taxes (other than income taxes)   increased     $9.0 million  , or   5.1 percent  , for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase was due to higher property taxes primarily in Minnesota, excluding the impact of the proposed settlement agreement in the Minnesota 2016 multi-year electric rate case. 
    
  Interest Charges       Interest charges   increased     $14.0 million  , or   9.1 percent  , for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase was related to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investment, partially offset by refinancings at lower interest rates.  
    
  Income Taxes       Income tax expense   increased     $41.0 million   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015.  The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2016 partially offset by an increase in wind production tax credits and research and experimentation credits in 2016. The ETR was   31.7 percent   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   34.5 percent   for the same period in 2015. The lower ETR in 2016 is primarily due to the adjustments referenced above. 

Public Utility Regulation 
    
  Except to the extent noted below, the circumstances set forth in Public Utility Regulation included in Item 1. of NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, and Public Utility Regulation included in Item 2 of NSP-Minnesota s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of public utility regulation, and are incorporated herein by reference.

NSP Resource Plans     In January 2015, NSP-Minnesota filed its 2016-2030 Integrated Resource Plan (the Plan) with the MPUC. 
    
  Subsequently, NSP-Minnesota proposed revisions to the Plan, which addressed stakeholder recommendations as well as the Clean Power Plan issued by the EPA.  The revised plan was based on four primary elements: (1) accelerate the transition from coal energy to renewables, (2) preserve regional system reliability, (3) pursue energy efficiency gains and grid modernization, and (4) ensure customer benefits.  The revised plan includes substantial opportunities for NSP-Minnesota ownership of renewable generation, and would result in 63 percent of NSP System energy being carbon-free by 2030 and a 60 percent reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030.  
    
  Specific terms of the proposal include: 

Partial replacement of Sherco coal generation with a 786 MW natural gas combined cycle unit at the Sherco site to coincide with the Unit 1 retirement;  
                
    The addition of a 230 MW natural gas combustion turbine in North Dakota by the end of 2025; 
                
    Operation of the Monticello and PI nuclear plants through their current license periods in the early 2030 s   -   and a commitment to provide additional information regarding forecasted cost increases at PI through end of licensed life if the MPUC wishes to further explore alternatives to operating PI through its current license periods. 
       
  In October 2016, the MPUC verbally approved NSP-Minnesota s plan, with modifications as follows: 

The acquisition of at least 1,000 MW of wind by 2019, with additional acquisitions dependent on considerations such as price, bidder qualifications, rate impact, transmission availability and location; 
                
    The acquisition of 650 MW of solar before 2021 through the community solar gardens program or other acquisitions - and pursuit of additional, cost-effective solar resources if it is in the best interests of its customers;  
                
    Determination of the proper mix of purchased power and Company-owned renewable resources shall be made during the resource acquisition process; 
                 
    Authorization for NSP-Minnesota to file a petition for a certificate of need to select the resource that best meets the system resource and local reliability needs associated with the retirement of Sherco Unit 1 in 2026; 
                 
    Submission of NSP-Minnesota s next Resource Plan by February 2019.  
       
  The MPUC s order on NSP-Minnesota s Resource Plan is expected in late 2016. 
    
  Request for Proposal (RFP)         In September 2016, NSP-Minnesota issued a RFP for 1,500 MW of wind generation to be in service by 2020.  The RFP requests both PPAs and Build-Own-Transfer proposals.  NSP-Minnesota intends to compare self-build options to the RFP bids to ensure that all resource additions are cost-competitive. 
    
  In October 2016, NSP-Minnesota submitted a petition for approval to the MPUC of a 750 MW self-build wind farm portfolio.  RFP bids were received in October 2016 and will be evaluated in conjunction with the self-build proposal.  
    
  An overview of the anticipated RFP schedule is as follows:

Minnesota Solar         Minnesota legislation requires 1.5 percent of a public utility s total electric retail sales to retail customers be generated using solar energy by 2020.  Of the 1.5 percent, 10 percent must come from systems sized 20 kilowatts or less.  NSP-Minnesota anticipates it will meet its compliance requirements through large and small scale solar additions. 
    
  NSP-Minnesota also offers customer solar programs: a solar production incentive program for rooftop solar, called Solar*Rewards , and a community solar garden program that provides bill credits to participating subscribers, called Solar*Rewards  Community .  Additionally, the DOC offers the  Made in Minnesota  program, providing incentives for the installation of small solar systems that were manufactured in-state, which generates renewable energy credits for utilities including NSP-Minnesota. 
    
  In August 2015, the MPUC issued an order regarding the Solar*Rewards Community program, limiting the size of solar installations eligible to participate in the program.  The order was appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which affirmed the MPUC s decision.  The decision was subsequently appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which denied the appeal in September 2016, terminating the case.  
    
  Nuclear Power Operations 
    
  NSP-Minnesota owns two nuclear generating plants: the Monticello plant and the PI plant.  See Note 12 of NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015 for further discussion regarding the nuclear generating plants.  The circumstances set forth in Nuclear Power Operations and Waste Disposal included in Item 1. of NSP-Minnesota s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, and Nuclear Power Operations included in Item 2 of NSP-Minnesota s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of nuclear power operations, and are incorporated herein by reference.  

Summary of Recent Federal Regulatory Developments 
    
  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
    
  Pipeline Safety Act     The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act (Pipeline Safety Act) requires additional verification of pipeline infrastructure records by pipeline owners and operators to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure of lines located in high consequence areas or more-densely populated areas.  In April 2016, the United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) released proposed rules that address this verification requirement along with a number of other significant changes to gas transmission regulations.  These changes include requirements around use of automatic or remote-controlled shut-off valves; testing of certain previously untested transmission lines; and expanding integrity management requirements. The Pipeline Safety Act also includes a maximum penalty for violating pipeline safety rules of $2 million per day for related violations.   
    
  NSP-Minnesota continues to analyze the proposed rule changes as they relate to costs, current operations and financial results.  PHMSA has indicated that they intend for the rules to go into effect in late 2017 or early 2018.   
    
  NSP-Minnesota has been taking actions that were intended to comply with the Pipeline Safety Act and any related PHMSA regulations as they become effective.  NSP-Minnesota can generally recover costs to comply with the transmission and distribution integrity management programs through the GUIC rider. 
    
  FERC 
    
  The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission service in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale, hydro facility licensing, natural gas transportation, asset transactions and mergers, accounting practices and certain other activities of NSP-Minnesota, including enforcement of North American Electric Reliability Corporation mandatory electric reliability standards.  State and local agencies have jurisdiction over many of NSP-Minnesota s activities, including regulation of retail rates and environmental matters.  See additional discussion in the summary of recent federal regulatory developments and public utility regulation sections of the NSP-Minnesota Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   Dec. 31, 2015   and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  In addition to the matters discussed below, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of other regulatory matters.

FERC Order, New ROE Policy     The FERC has adopted a new two-step ROE methodology for electric utilities.  The issue of how to apply the new FERC ROE methodology is being contested in various complaint proceedings.  There are two ROE complaints against the MISO TOs, which include NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin.  In September 2016, the FERC issued an order in the first MISO ROE complaint which upheld the initial decision made by the ALJ in December 2015.  The second complaint is pending FERC action after issuance of an initial decision by the ALJ in June 2016.  FERC is not expected to issue an order in the second litigated MISO ROE complaint proceeding until 2017.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the MISO ROE Complaints. 
    
  Formula Rate Treatment of Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT)     In 2015, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin filed changes to their transmission formula rates to comply with IRS guidance regarding how ADIT must be reflected in formula rates using future test years and a true-up.  The filings were intended to ensure that NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin are in compliance with IRS rules and may continue to use accelerated tax depreciation.  In December 2015, the FERC partially accepted the proposed NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin transmission formula rate changes, but rejected changes regarding the treatment of ADIT in the formula rate true-up.  In September 2016, FERC issued an order clarifying that NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin may incorporate ADIT true-up provisions in their formula rate.  However, submission of a new tariff change filing is required to implement the change.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin expect to file a change to their transmission formula rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will request a Jan. 1, 2016 effective date. 
    
  Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) and MISO Complaints Regarding RTO Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)         SPP and MISO were involved in a long-running dispute regarding the interpretation of their JOA, which is intended to coordinate RTO operations along the MISO/SPP system boundary.  SPP and MISO disagreed over MISO s authority to transmit power between the traditional MISO region in the Midwest and the Entergy system.  Several cases were filed with the FERC by MISO and SPP between 2011 and 2014. 
    
  In January 2016, the FERC approved a settlement between SPP, MISO and other parties that resolves various disputed matters and provides a defined settlement compensation plan by MISO to SPP.  MISO will pay SPP $16 million for the two-year retroactive period (February 2014 to January 2016) and $16 million annually prospectively starting Feb. 1, 2016, subject to a true-up.  In January 2016, SPP filed a proposal regarding distribution of the MISO revenues to SPP members, including SPS.  In March 2016, the FERC issued an order rejecting one component of the SPP filing, accepting the remainder of the SPP tariff proposal subject to refund.  In August 2016, MISO and other parties filed a settlement regarding the April 2014 MISO tariff change filing to recover SPP JOA charges in MISO rates.  The settlement is pending FERC approval.  NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin expect to be able to recover any resulting MISO charges in retail rates.  The JOA revenue allocated to SPS under the filed SPP proposal was not expected to be material. 

Item 4       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  NSP-Minnesota maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the participation of NSP-Minnesota s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and the procedures, the CEO and CFO have concluded that NSP-Minnesota s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  Effective January 2016, NSP-Minnesota implemented the general ledger modules of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to improve certain financial and related transaction processes.  During 2016 and 2017, NSP-Minnesota will continue implementing additional modules and expects to begin conversion of existing work management systems to this new ERP system.  In connection with this ongoing implementation, NSP-Minnesota has updated and will continue updating its internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and accounting procedures.  NSP-Minnesota does not expect the implementation of the additional modules to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  No changes in NSP-Minnesota s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NSP-Minnesota s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II       OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  NSP-Minnesota is involved in various litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Management maintains accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.  Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories.  In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss. 
    
  Additional Information 
    
  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of legal claims and environmental proceedings.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of proceedings involving utility rates and other regulatory matters.

  NSP-Minnesota Cautionary Factors 
    
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements to encourage disclosures without the threat of litigation, providing those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful, cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement.  Forward-looking statements are made in written documents and oral presentations of NSP-Minnesota, Xcel Energy Inc. or any of its other subsidiaries.  These statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions and information currently available to management.  Such forward-looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   objective,   outlook,   plan,   project,   possible,   potential,   should  and similar expressions.  In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements, factors that could cause NSP-Minnesota s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 

Economic conditions, including inflation rates, monetary fluctuations and their impact on capital expenditures; 
                
    The risk of a significant slowdown in growth or decline in the U.S. economy, the risk of delay in growth recovery in the U.S. economy or the risk of increased cost for insurance premiums, security and other items as a consequence of past or future terrorist attacks; 
                
    Trade, monetary, fiscal, taxation and environmental policies of governments, agencies and similar organizations in geographic areas where NSP-Minnesota has a financial interest; 
                
    Customer business conditions, including demand for their products or services and supply of labor and materials used in creating their products and services; 
                
    Financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by the FASB, the SEC, the FERC and similar entities with regulatory oversight; 
                
    Availability or cost of capital such as changes in: interest rates; market perceptions of the utility industry, NSP-Minnesota, Xcel Energy Inc. or any of its other subsidiaries; or security ratings; 
                
    Factors affecting utility and nonutility operations such as unusual weather conditions; catastrophic weather-related damage; unscheduled generation outages, maintenance or repairs; unanticipated changes to fossil fuel, nuclear fuel or natural gas supply costs or availability due to higher demand, shortages, transportation problems or other developments; nuclear or environmental incidents; cyber incidents; or electric transmission or natural gas pipeline constraints; 
                
    Employee workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key executives, collective-bargaining agreements with union employees, or work stoppages; 
                
    Increased competition in the utility industry or additional competition in the markets served by NSP-Minnesota, Xcel Energy Inc. and its other subsidiaries; 
                
    State, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rate structures and affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; industry restructuring initiatives; transmission system operation and/or administration initiatives; recovery of investments made under traditional regulation; nature of competitors entering the industry; retail wheeling; a new pricing structure; and former customers entering the generation market; 
                
       Environmental laws and regulations, including legislation and regulations relating to climate change, and the associated cost of compliance; 
                
    Rate-setting policies or procedures of regulatory entities, including environmental externalities, which are values established by regulators assigning environmental costs to each method of electricity generation when evaluating generation resource options; 
                
    Nuclear regulatory policies and procedures, including operating regulations and spent nuclear fuel storage; 
                
    Social attitudes regarding the utility and power industries; 
                
    Cost and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; 
                
    Technological developments that result in competitive disadvantages and create the potential for impairment of existing assets; 
                
    Risks associated with implementations of new technologies; and 
                
    Other business or investment considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in SEC filings, including  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of NSP-Minnesota s Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,   2015  , or in other publicly disseminated written documents.
