1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Organization 

Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (referred to as the Company, formerly Unwired Planet, Inc.) is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. The Company is in the investment management business; developing financial products and seeking business acquisitions or investments with a view to long-term value creation.  

Prior to June 30, 2016, the Company s subsidiaries were engaged in patent licensing with a portfolio of mobile technology patents and patent applications.  The subsidiaries associated with the patent licensing business were sold as of June 30, 2016, and all activities associated with them have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the periods presented in this report. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (  US GAAP  ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (  SEC  ). Accordingly, they do not contain all of the information and notes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary, consisting of those in the normal course of business and recurring in nature, for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, and the results of its operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents consist primarily of exchange traded money market funds. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions or the issuers of these investments to the extent the amounts on deposit or invested are in excess of amounts that are insured.

Reclassifications 

On July 1, 2016, the Company the implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board s (  FASB  ) Accounting Standards Update (  ASU  ) No. 2015-03   Interest  Imputation of Interest (Topic 830)   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  The ASU requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the nature of debt discounts and its implementation results in reclassification of the prior periods.  The Company reclassified $200 and $900 of debt issuance costs from prepaid and other current assets to related party notes payable as of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

See Note 5 for Discontinued Operations reclassifications. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07   Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures   (Topic 323).  The amendment eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required.  The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method.  The amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be adopted prospectively with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the applicability of the amendment on its future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (Topic 230).  The amendment provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: 

1. 

Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs     

2. 

Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing     

3. 

Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination     

4. 

Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims     

5. 

Proceeds from the settlement of corporate owned life insurance policies including bank-owned life insurance policies     

6. 

Distributions received from equity method investees     

7. 

Beneficial interests in securitization transactions     

8. 

Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle     

The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The Company will evaluate the applicability of the provisions of the amendment on specifically covered transactions as they arise.  If the Company elects early adoption for one of the specific provisions, the amendment requires early adoption for all eight of the cash flow issues.

The net income tax benefit in continuing operations recognized for the period is based on forecasted financial results associated with the Company s continuing operations for the entire fiscal year; the Company having a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax positions at the beginning of the year and expected to remain consistent at the end of the year; and the overall net tax position for the fiscal year expected to be zero.  However, in accordance with intraperiod tax allocation rules promulgated by US GAAP, the Company is required to consider all sources of income in determining the benefit related to a loss from continuing operations, including any income from other than continuing operations, such as discontinued operations.  The Company will re-evaluate its fiscal 2017 forecast and re-compute its effective tax rate on a quarterly basis through the end of the fiscal year, and adjust the provision associated with intraperiod tax allocation rules quarterly, as applicable.

The payment, received in October 2016, included reimbursement of litigation costs incurred by the Company of approximately $2,000.

These forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and beliefs of our management and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events and results of performance to differ materially from those indicated by these statements. Words such as  anticipates ,  expects ,  intends ,  plans ,  believes ,  seeks ,  will ,  estimates , and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements address future events and conditions concerning intellectual property acquisition and development, licensing and enforcement activities, investment plans, capital expenditures, earnings, litigation, regulatory matters, markets for our services, liquidity and capital resources, and accounting matters. Actual results in each case could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements by reason of factors such as future economic and market conditions, legislative, regulatory and competitive developments, pending mergers, acquisition and investment transactions, results of litigation, and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs. The occurrence of the events described above or below could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Form 10-Q and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements except as required by law. You should carefully review the risk factors described in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Form 10-Q. 

Overview of Our Business 

Until June 30, 2016, we conducted a patent business drawing upon a portfolio of approximately 2,500 patent assets with a goal of generating revenue by selling and licensing our patents.  Our patent licensing operations and holding of the underlying patents were conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

In April 2016, we entered into an agreement to divest our patent licensing operations. That transaction closed on June 30, 2016. We have restated our financial statements to account for the patent licensing component of our operations as discontinued operations. 

Our goal is to build a diversified holding company focused on return on investment and long-term value creation. Our first investment in furtherance of this goal is our transaction with Full Circle. We have invested $30 million in GECC which, as of September 30, 2016, was our wholly-owned subsidiary. Our GECM subsidiary will be GECC's external investment advisor, and we expect that costs against GECMs investment management fee stream to be in the range 45% to 65% of revenue which is expected to result in recurring free cash flows and taxable income in the future.  

We are embarking on a program of creating bespoke financial products and creating an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These efforts are currently constrained by our capital resources and we expect to access the equity and debt markets as opportunities present themselves.  

On September 13, 2016, we called our Notes for redemption and announced a proposed $45.0 million rights offering (together with a $36.6 million backstop commitment). 

Significant Accounting Policies and Judgments 

There have not been any material changes to the significant accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  As of the date of this report, we are evaluating the potential impacts of the Great Elm Capital Corp. transactions on our significant accounting policies and estimates.

Results of Operations 

In conjunction with the disposal of our patent licensing business, we shifted our business operations to focus on return on investment and long-term value creation. 

Revenues 

Upon completion of the Merger, we anticipate generating revenue primarily from our investment management services and dividends on our investment in GECC.  For the periods presented, we did not generate any significant revenue and our reclassified prior period discontinued operations includes only deferred revenue recognition from a contract in which the proceeds were received in 2014, with the exception of the one-time payment received from Microsoft of $8.8 million related to our discontinued operations. 

Operating Expenses 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses were $2.5 million, a   54  % increase over the $1.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  This increase is attributable to increases associated with professional fees in connection with the Full Circle transaction and further exploration and development of potential acquisitions, financial products and new investments. 

Discontinued Operating Expenses 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we incurred expenses from our previous patent licensing business totaling $0.2 million.  In addition, during the three-months ended September 30, 2016, we reached a final settlement with Microsoft Corporation for a one-time payment of $8.8 million.  The payment, received on October 24, 2016, included approximately $2.0 million of reimbursed litigation costs.  In addition, we record approximately $5.3 million related to our legacy fee split agreements.  

For the same period in fiscal 2016, we incurred total costs of approximately $8.6 million to operate our divested subsidiaries. 

Interest Expense 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our interest expense was $3.5 million, a 291% increase over the $1.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we paid interest in cash, totaling approximately $1.2 million as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, when we paid interest on our Notes by in-kind payments.  We recorded $  0.2 million   of expense in connection with the extinguishment of $7.9 million in aggregate principal of the Notes, and incurred non-recurring accelerated recognition of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs totaling $2.2 million.  On October 18, 2016, all of the remaining the Notes were retired for a total cash payment of $30.7 million inclusive of interest and redemption premiums totaling $2.0 million.  On the retirement date, we recognized interest expense total $0.6 million associated with remaining debt discount and issuance cost amortization. 

Working Capital and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2016, our working capital was approximately $33.6 million.  Included in our working capital at September 30, 2016, $30.0 million was invested in GECC and has been reclassified from cash to investments upon the deconsolidation of GECC on November 1, 2016.  As of the date of this report, we incurred expenses totaling $3.4 million that we expect to be reimbursed by GECC. 

In November 2016, we received a one-time payment from Microsoft to settle all previous outstanding judgments, appeals, and litigation.  We expect to retain approximately $3.4 million of the proceeds after our accrued fee split obligations. 

After the retirement of our Notes, completion of the Merger, and the completion of our rights offering (and the backstop) we expect to have in excess of $40 million of cash and cash equivalents.

In addition to the rights offering, we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities to fund growth activities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges, senior to current holders of our common stock and the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders and additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. 

There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in amounts sufficient to meet our long-term requirements, if at all. If additional financing is necessary and we are unable to obtain the additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned intellectual property activities, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Cash Used In Operating Activities 

Cash used in operating activities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $10.4 million, consisting of $2.7 million from continuing operations and $7.7 million from discontinued operations. Total cash used in operations increased approximately $2.3 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2015.   The increase is primarily related to a one-time gross receivable due from Microsoft of $8.8 million classified as discontinued operations, and professional fees incurred in connection with our merger, acquisition, and other business development activities. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 

We did not initiate any investing activities during the period quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015, was approximately $8.0 million from the sales and maturities of investments in order to fund the losses of our divested patent business. 

Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we made principal payments on our related party notes payable of $7.9 million and did not conduct significant financing activities in prior comparable period.  As of the date of this report, we settled our remaining related party notes with a remaining principal balance of $28.7 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the above evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Form 10-Q was (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP. 

We identified a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 related to the preparation of our provision for income taxes.  We are in the process of remediating this material weakness and currently evaluating whether certain changes in our provision for income tax processes are currently sufficient to remediate the material weakness that occurred in the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 

Except as set forth in the preceding paragraph, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
