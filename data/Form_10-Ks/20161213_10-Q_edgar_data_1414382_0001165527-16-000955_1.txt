                                October 31, 2016

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America
for interim  financial  information  and with the  instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article  8  of  Regulation  S-X.  Accordingly,  they  do  not  include  all  the
information and footnotes required by accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  for  complete  financial  statements.  In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered  necessary for a fair  presentation  have been included.  For further
information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in
the Concrete Leveling  Systems,  Inc. Form 10-K filing for the period ended July
31, 2016.

NOTE B - GOING CONCERN

As shown in the financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $20,095
for the three months ended October 31, 2016,  and has incurred  substantial  net
losses since its  inception.  At October 31, 2016,  current  liabilities  exceed
current  assets by $247,283.  These  factors raise  substantial  doubt about the
Company's  ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial  statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded assets, or the amounts and  classification of liabilities that might be
necessary in the event the Company cannot continue existence.

                                       5
 
ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

     Concrete  Leveling  Systems,  Inc.  ("CLS"  or  "The  Company")  became  an
operating  company in 2009. As of October 31, 2016, CLS has cash assets of $821,
no accounts  receivable and net notes receivable in the amount of $2,363.  As of
October 31, 2016, the Company was carrying inventory valued at $23,607.

     The Company's cash flow is currently not sufficient to maintain operations.
However,  the Company is receiving periodic payments from the self financed sale
of its concrete  leveling  service  units,  which creates some cash flow for the
Company.  Mr. Edward A. Barth has continued to contact  companies  regarding the
service  units and has listed the service  units held in inventory  on Ebay.  To
date, the Company has been contacted with inquiries  regarding the purchase of a
unit, but no acceptable offers have been made.

     CLS  continues  to have cash flow issues.  As of October 31,  2016,  it had
total current liabilities of $275,083, which includes advances from stockholders
and notes and  accounts  payable  to  stockholders  in the  amount of  $217,525,
including accrued interest on those  obligations.  The Company had a net loss of
$20,095  during the  quarter.  Mr.  Barth  continues  to remain in contact  with
potential  purchasers,  who have  expressed an interest in  purchasing a service
unit. The purchase of the Company's  product is seasonal in nature.  Interest in
purchasing  the concrete  leveling  service  units  increases in late winter and
early spring, since the use of the product is restricted by cold temperature.

     There are no off balance sheet arrangements involving CLS at this time.

     Liquidity  Issues.  Since  its  inception,   the  Company  has  experienced
continued  need for  additional  liquidity  in order to  provide  for  operating
expenses and to purchase components for the assembly of its product. The company
maintains an inventory of two  substantially  completed  service  units.  In the
event the Company  receives an order for a concrete  leveling  service  unit, it
will seek a down payment in an amount  sufficient to complete the unit, in order
not to have to borrow  additional  funds. The Company is currently  relying upon
loans from stockholders to meet operating expenses.

     Capital  Resources.  CLS  has  made no  material  commitments  for  capital
expenditures  as of the end of its fiscal  quarter  ending  October 31, 2016 and
does not anticipate any immediate need for material  capital  expenditures  over
the next quarter.

     Result of  Operations.  During the  quarter  ended  October 31,  2016,  the
Company  has  experienced  little  activity.  The  Company has devoted a limited
amount of its  resources to marketing its product  during the last  quarter.  At
present,  it is not in  discussions  with any  potential  buyers of its concrete
leveling service units.

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     Disclosure  Controls  and  Procedures.  Pursuant to Rule  13a-15(b)  of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934  ("Exchange  Act"),  the Company carried out an
evaluation,  with the participation of the Company's management,  which consists
of the  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer (CEO) and Chief  Financial  Officer
(CFO), of the effectiveness of the Company's  disclosure controls and procedures
(as  defined  under Rule  13a-15(e)  of the  Exchange  Act) as of the end of the

                                       6
 
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company concluded
that the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the
Company  files or  submits  under the  Exchange  Act,  is  recorded,  processed,
summarized and reported,  within the time period  specified by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,   including  the
Company's  CEO and CFO, as  appropriate,  to allow  timely  decisions  regarding
required disclosure.

         Changes in Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  There are no
changes  in the  Company's  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  that
occurred  during the three  months ended  October 31, 2016 that have  materially
affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially  affect, the internal controls
over financial reporting.

                           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     To the best of its  knowledge,  management of CLS is not aware of any legal
proceedings in which CLS is currently involved.

ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

     There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during this quarter.

ITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

     There are no defaults upon any senior securities.

5.   The  small  business  issuer's  other  certifying  officer(s)  and  I  have
     disclosed,  based on our most recent  evaluation  of internal  control over
     financial reporting,  to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit
     committee of the small  business  issuer's  board of directors  (or persons
     performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the small  business  issuer's
          ability   to  record,   process,   summarize   and  report   financial
          information; and
     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant  role in the small business  issuer's
          internal control over financial reporting.
