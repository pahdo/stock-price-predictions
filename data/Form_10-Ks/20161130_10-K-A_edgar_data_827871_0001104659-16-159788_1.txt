  (a)                              In the case of a Third Party Claim made by any Person who is not a Party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) as to which a Party (the   Indemnitor  ) may be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, such Party seeking indemnification hereunder (the   Indemnitee  ) will notify the Indemnitor in writing of the Third Party Claim (and specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis for the Third Party Claim and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third Party Claim) reasonably promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification will not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. 
     
 22   

(b)                              If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee and the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee therefor, the Indemnitor will be entitled, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of written notice from the Indemnitee of the commencement or assertion of any such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof (at the expense of the Indemnitor) with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, for so long as the Indemnitor is conducting a good faith and diligent defense.  Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if under applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in respect of such claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor) to represent such Indemnitee with respect to the matters as to which a conflict of interest exists and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by such Indemnitor; provided, further, that the Indemnitor shall only be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for such Indemnitee.  If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor.  If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will promptly supply to the Indemnitee copies of all correspondence and documents relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim and keep the Indemnitee informed of developments relating to or in connection with such Third Party Claim, as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitee (including, without limitation, providing to the Indemnitee on reasonable request updates and summaries as to the status thereof).  If the Indemnitor chooses to defend a Third Party Claim, all Indemnitees shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense thereof (such cooperation to be at the expense, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, of the Indemnitor).  If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim within the one hundred twenty (120) day period set forth above, or if such good faith and diligent defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall have the right, at the expense of the Indemnitor, after three (3) Business Days  notice to the Indemnitor of its intent to do so, to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim for the account of the Indemnitor (with counsel selected by the Indemnitee), and to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, exercising reasonable business judgment; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitor s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such compromise or settlement would result in an admission or liability or loss of right by the lndemnitor or payment by the Indemnitor.  The Indemnitor agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitee in such defense, at the Indemnitor s expense, including being joined as a necessary party.

If the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not (unless required by law) admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitor s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

Prior to bringing a legal action against the other Party, such dispute shall be separately negotiated by the Parties hereto in good faith and all reasonable efforts undertaken to settle amicably such matters before resorting to further legal recourse, as follows: upon the occurrence of a dispute between the Parties, including, without limitation, any breach of this Agreement or any obligation relating thereto, or any dispute with respect to whether a product is an Licensed Product, the matter shall be referred to the chief executive officers of Teikoku and Licensee, or their designees.

In case such valid provisions cannot be agreed upon, the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, unless the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions are of such essential importance to this Agreement that it is to be reasonably assumed that the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement without the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement (other than provisions involving the payment of money) are not performed by a Party in accordance with their specific terms, and that any breach of, or failure to perform or comply with, this Agreement by a Party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
