  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  December 31, 2015   

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   
   
           JayHawk Energy, Inc. (the  Company  or  JayHawk ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Jayhawk Gas Transportation Company, are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, production and sale of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids primarily from conventional reservoirs within North America.  The Company incorporated in Colorado on April 5, 2004 as Bella Trading Company, Inc.  During the third quarter ending June 30, 2007, the Company changed management and entered the oil and gas business, and ceased all activity in retail jewelry.  On June 21, 2007, the Company changed its name to JayHawk Energy, Inc.  Since then, the Company has devoted its efforts principally to the raising of capital, organizational infrastructure development, the acquisition of oil and gas properties and exploration activities in Kansas and North Dakota.  The Company also formed a wholly owned subsidiary to transport natural gas in Kansas called JayHawk Gas Transportation Corporation. 
   
 On September 1, 2015, the Company disposed of all its interests, tangible or intangible, in and to the assets held or owned by the Company in the State of North Dakota. The disposition of the Company s North Dakota assets was completed through an asset assignment to a related party.    
   
 On October 8, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Domestication and corresponding Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada. Effective October 8, 2015, the Company s state of organization was moved from Colorado to Nevada. On October 22, 2015, the Company, in conjunction with its domestication to the State of Nevada, filed Articles of Dissolution in the State of Colorado.  
   
 The Company's strategy is to increase shareholder value through strategic acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, primarily in North America.  
   
 As of December 31, 2015, JayHawk Energy remains an early stage oil and gas exploration company. The Company's immediate business plan is to focus its efforts on identifying oil and gas assets for future acquisition and development.  The Company is actively focused on shifting to a liquids-rich development focus, primarily in established oil and gas producing regions of North America. The Company's main priority will be given to projects with near term cash flow potential and proven, producing oil and gas reserves. Future acquisition and development activities will be determined by the Company's ability to access sources of sufficient funding. 
            NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, as well as the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending September 30, 2016. 
           For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015. 
   
            Principles of Consolidation  
   
           The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary JayHawk Gas Transportation Company after elimination of the intercompany accounts and transactions. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows.  As shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $28,156,038 and a net loss of $416,873 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, and as of that date the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $2,005,120.  Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing, to locate profitable energy properties and generate revenue from current and planned business

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  December 31, 2015   

operations, and control costs.  The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing, obtaining additional financing from investors, and/or lenders, and attaining additional commercial production.  However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives, therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists.  The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the settlement of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods.  Significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to asset impairments, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, income taxes and derivatives.  Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material effect on the Company's reported financial position and results of operations. 
   
  Income or Loss Per Common Share  
   
 Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities.  
   
 The potential dilutive effect of convertible and outstanding securities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 would be as follows: 

At December 31, 2015, the effect of the Company's common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.    At December 31, 2014, the effect of the Company s stock options added 1,560,976 common stock equivalents to the diluted weighted average shares outstanding figure, which affected earnings per share by $Nil; other potentially dilutive items would have been anti-dilutive. 
   
  Revenue and Cost Recognition  
   
 The Company uses the sales method of accounting for oil and gas revenues. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volumes of gas and oil sold to purchasers. The volume sold may differ from the volumes the Company may be entitled to, based on the Company's individual interest in the property.  Periodically, imbalances between production and nomination volumes can occur for various reasons.  In cases where imbalances have occurred, a production imbalance receivable or liability will be recorded when determined.  Costs associated with production are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
   
  Cash Equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Reclassifications  
   
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2014 financial statements to conform to the 2015 presentation.  These reclassifications have no effect on net loss, total assets or accumulated deficit as previously reported.   See Note 18 regarding revision of financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern. The guidance requires an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). If conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, the guidance requires disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance will be effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The Company plans to adopt this standard effective October 1, 2017 and anticipates the adoption will have minimal impact on the financial statements because the Company currently discloses the information required.  
   
  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS         
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, reclamation bonds, and promissory notes payable approximate fair value due to their limited time to maturity or ability to immediately convert them to cash in the normal course. The approximate fair value of the convertible debentures and convertible line of credit and accrued interest related to the debentures and line of credit based upon the number of shares into which the debentures are convertible is $982,081 using the current market price per share of stock at December 31, 2015.   
   
 The table below sets forth the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and the fair value calculation input hierarchy that the Company has determined has applied to each asset and liability category. 

NOTE 4   UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND IMPAIRMENT       
 The total of the Company's investment in unproved properties and equipment at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, consists of the following capitalized costs respectively: 

The Company s Kansas properties are currently not producing.  Management intends to evaluate the prospects of returning to production during the subsequent fiscal year and determine the economic viability of the project thereafter.

NOTE 5   PROVED PROPERTIES AND IMPAIRMENT         
   
 During the year ended September 30, 2015, management scrapped certain capitalized drilling costs and equipment associated with the Jenks and Knudsen wells in Crosby, North Dakota.  The Company determined the costs associated with completing the necessary engineering, road improvements and purchase of additional equipment to construct a disposal well exceeded the future benefits of said well.  The Company has plugged both the Jenks and Knudsen well bores. The loss on write-off of $11,527 was charged to operations as  Loss on leases and equipment . 
   
  Effective September 1, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance (the  Assignment ) with Vast Holdings, LLC ( Vast Holdings ), a related party at September 30, 2015.  The Assignment sells and assigns to Vast Holdings, in consideration of ten dollars ($10.00), all of the Company s right, title, interest and estate, real or personal, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, in and to the assets held or owned by the Company in the State of North Dakota, including but not limited to: oil, gas and/or mineral leases, fee mineral interests, leasehold estates, mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, reversionary interests, net profits interests, and other similar rights, estates and interests and other agreements, the oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the assets and all units, wells, equipment, contracts, and records. Vast Holdings did not assume various liabilities associated with the North Dakota assets, including, but not limited to, working and royalty interests payable and liabilities associated with reclamation of the North Dakota properties.  
   
  Vast Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vast Exploration, LLC.  Vast Exploration is a controlling shareholder of the Company, the contract operator of the Company s oil and gas properties and an affiliate of Vast Petroleum Corp., an entity that entered into a joint development agreement for the Company s oil and gas operations in Kansas in May 2014. The Assignment was made in lieu of foreclosure of certain Company debt obligations and the Company determined ten dollars was appropriate monetary consideration.  
   
  NOTE 6   RECLAMATION BONDS   
 Reclamation bonds consists of various deposits and reclamation bonds.  Detail is disclosed in the following table: 

NOTE 7   CONVERTIBLE LINE OF CREDIT RELATED PARTY  
   
 On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit loan agreement ( Loan ) with Vast Exploration, LLC (the  Lender  or  Vast Exploration ). The Loan permits the Company to borrow up to $100,000 with an interest rate equal to 1.5% per month of the unpaid principal balance on the loan. The Company is required to pay principal on demand or, if not sooner demanded, then on or before June 30, 2016.  The Company is required to pay interest on demand or, if not sooner demanded, then on the 1st day of each month, commencing August 1, 2015. After demand, interest on the outstanding balance of the Loan will accrue at a rate equal to 2% per month. Vast Exploration has the right, at any time after the date of the Loan, at its election, to convert all or part of the Loan into shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of the lesser of 1) $0.005 per share or 2) 50% of the average of the three lowest trades during the twenty-five previous trading days preceding a conversion. 
   
 On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into a Line of Credit Modification Agreement with Vast Exploration ( Modification Agreement ).  The Modification Agreement adjusts the maximum principal balance that may be borrowed from $100,000 to $150,000.  At its sole discretion, Vast Exploration may increase the maximum principal balance beyond $150,000. 
   
 On September 25, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Line of Credit Modification Agreement with Vast Exploration ( Second Modification Agreement ).  The Second Modification Agreement amends the conversion price in the Loan to a non-variable conversion price of $0.005 per share of common stock. Advances related to reclamation of North Dakota properties (Note 16) may be converted at a non-variable conversion price of $0.0025 per share of common stock.

At December 31, 2015, principal payments on the convertible debentures are due as follows: 

NOTE 9   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   
  Conversion Options Derivative  
   
 The Company had convertible debentures which contained provisions allowing holders of the debentures to convert outstanding debt to shares of the Company's common stock (Note 8). The debentures contained anti-dilution provisions which call for the debt conversion and warrant exercise prices to be reduced based on future issues of debt or equity with more favorable provisions.  Management has determined that these provisions cause the conversion options and warrants to require derivative liability accounting.  As such, management valued them at fair value at the date of issuance.    During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a modification agreement with the holders of the convertible debentures.  The modification agreement changed the conversion price to $0.01 per common share and specifically eliminated provisions of the debentures requiring conversion derivative accounting.  The fair value of the derivative liability on that date of $1,244,472 was charged to  additional paid-in capital . 
   
  Warrant Derivative  
   
 Stock purchase warrants were also issued with the convertible debentures (Note 8).   Provisions contained within these warrants require the warrants to be accounted for as derivatives.    At December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively, the fair value of warrant derivative liability was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: 

Below is detail of the change in warrant derivative liability balance for three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively:

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  December 31, 2015   

At December 31, 2015, principal payments on these notes are due as follows: 

NOTE 11 - ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  
 The Company has identified asset retirement obligations at the Girard, Kansas and Crosby, North Dakota operating sites.  These retirement obligations are determined based on the estimated cost to comply with abandonment regulations established by the Kansas Corporation Commission and the State of North Dakota.  The Company's engineers have estimated the cost, to comply with these regulations.  These estimates have been projected out to the anticipated retirement date 6 to 15 years in the future, at an assumed inflation rate of 1.5 percent.  These amounts were discounted back at an assumed interest rate of 10 percent, to arrive at a net present value of the obligation.  
   
 During the year ended September 30, 2015, with respect to its Kansas properties, the Company revised its estimate to include additional well bores not previously considered to be subject to remediation exposure for the Company.  The increase in present value liability was added to the Company s Asset Retirement Obligation Asset which shall be amortized over the remaining useful life of the Kansas asset.   The Company revised its estimate on the remaining Kansas Asset Retirement Obligation to $112,311 as of September 30, 2015.  
   
 During the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the obligation increased by accretion expense of $6,166 and $4,016 respectively.

On July 10, 2014, the Company completed reclamation work on both the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 waste water storage pits.  Although reclamation work was to have been completed by June 30, 2014, unseasonably heavy rains which saturated the soil and limited safe access to the site by heavy equipment delayed scheduled reclamation until such time as ground conditions improved. The Company also completed plugging of the  production zone  on the Jenks #1 well and set a balance plug on the Knudsen #1 well bore.  Due to JayHawk s failure to timely submit a cost estimate for the final plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1 well and site, the NDIC, on January 28, 2015, pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588 ordered JayHawk to file a $120,000 bond covering the Jenks #1. The bond was a plugging and reclamation bond.  On May 9, 2015, the Company received a copy of a Summons and Complaint filed by the State of North Dakota and the NDIC in the Northwest Judicial District Court of North Dakota alleging JayHawk had violated N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08 by failing to post the $120,000 plugging and reclamation bond pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588. N.D.C.C.   38-08-16 provides that anyone who violates a provision of N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08, or any rule or regulation of the Commission is subject to a penalty of up to $12,500 for each offense, and each day s violation is a separate offense. The Complaint s prayer for relief requested that JayHawk be ordered to deposit $120,000 with the Bank of North Dakota to satisfy the Commission s requirement for the plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1 well. The NDIC also requested that JayHawk pay a fine of $12,500 per day beginning February 4, 2015, for failure to provide a plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1. The Company subsequently met with the NDIC, which resulted in the NDIC staying the litigation subject to JayHawk s immediate plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1. In September of 2015 the Company completed final plugging and abandonment of the Jenks #1 and completed a partial reclamation of the well and site.  
   
 On February 12, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Staff of the Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas with respect to a Penalty Order served by the Company for failure to comply with certain portions of the Kansas Administrative Regulations.

The Company has subsequently submitted 71 temporary abandonment applications, of which 71 applications were approved.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
             
  Results of Operations  
   
  Revenues:  For the three months ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues reported as JayHawk's net working interest were $Nil and $68,792 respectively.  The comparative volume of oil and gas delivered and the average prices received during each of the two respective three month periods of 2015 and 2014, are disclosed in the following table:   

Oil Revenues:  As commented in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements above, the Company recognizes revenues only to the extent of its net working interest, which is the remainder after deduction of the outside working and royalty interests. 
   
 No oil was sold during the three months ended December 31, 2015.  For the three-month period ending December 31, 2014, JayHawk sold a gross 2,661 barrels (Bbls).    This production was sold at average prices of $50.34/Bbl.  Volumes of oil delivered during the three-month period ending December 31, 2015 decreased by 2,661 barrels over the same timeframe in 2014.  
   
 The decrease in gross revenues is wholly attributable to the Company's conveyance of the Crosby, North Dakota wells to Vast Exploration, LLC, a related party.  The Company divested of its oil wells on September 1, 2015.   
   
  Gas Revenues:   Revenues derived from gas sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $Nil and $Nil, respectively. The Company suspended production in 2013 with the intent of re-starting operations in Kansas in anticipation of increased natural gas prices at some point in the future. The Company did not produce natural gas during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, due to low natural gas prices and significant costs associated with upgrading the meters at its Bourbon County tap head.  The average price received for the 12- month period ending September 31, 2015 was $0.00 per mcf.  The average price received for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2014 was $0.00 per mcf.   The Company will determine in fiscal year end September 30, 2017 whether it s Kansas - Girard Project remains economically viable under current market conditions. 
   
  Exploration Expenses:   There were no exploration expenses incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.  
   
  Operating Expenses:   Production expenses are comprised of field labor, maintenance, chemicals, fuel, and salt water disposal, less amounts charged other working interests in the particular wells. 
   
 The expenses associated with the Company s North Dakota oil operations changed from $56,651 for the three months ending December 31, 2014 to $2,159 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $53,849.  The most significant reason behind the decrease in operating expenses was the conveyance of the North Dakota-Crosby project to Vast Exploration, LLC. 

20 

Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $70,859 and $179,353, respectively.  The expenses are segregated as follows:  

General and Administrative Expenses:   General and administrative expenses decreased 57.8% or $62,285 to $45,515 for the three months ended December 31, 2015 from $107,800 for the comparable period ended December 31, 2014. 

Compensation and payroll taxes decreased $13,607 over the prior period.  Company management took no salary during the three months ended December 31, 2015, and all compensation related expenses were non-cash accruals.  The Company accrued no director fees during the three months ending December 31, 2015. 
   
 Audit fees and public company expense decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2015 by $31,400 over the comparable three months ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of timing of the completion of the prior year audit.   Legal, professional and consulting fees increased $14,348 for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 for the same reason as a result of expenses associated with proxy filings and special corporate meetings.    
   
 Office and general administrative expenses decreased $11,783 as the company no longer maintained a corporate office and associated location-related expenses. 

21 

Other Income (Expense):   Detail of the aggregate of this classification is disclosed in the following table:  

Net interest, related party increased $39,727 during the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014.  Net interest and financing costs decreased $32,985 during the same timeframe, as certain debentures were assigned to Vast Exploration, LLC, a related party in 2016.  The aggregate increase in interest expense was a result of additional balance on the Line of Credit from Vast Exploration, LLC.  Additionally, interest expense is reported net of interest income, of which there was a minimal amount reported in the current fiscal period as a result of limited excess cash availability for investment.    
   
 The Company recognized a loss of $274,439 related to settlements of liabilities for liabilities assumed by Vast Exploration, LLC through the Warrant Purchase Agreement (See Note 19 in the financial statements). 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
   
 At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's cash balances were $Nil and $81,790, respectively.  The Company's accounts receivable totaled $Nil and $41,821 respectively.   
   
 The Company's working capital deficit (current liabilities less current assets) was $2,005,120 at December 31, 2015 of which $470,439 is in the form of convertible debentures which are currently due.  At December 31, 2014, the Company's working capital deficit was $2,424,239, of which $918,687 of convertible debentures were due in the current year and in default.   
   
 To fully carry out the Company's business plans the Company needs to raise a substantial amount of additional capital, or obtain industry joint venture financing. The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to raise such capital or enter into any other beneficial business arrangements. The Company has limited financial resources until such time that it is able to generate such additional financing or cash flow from operations. The Company's ability to establish profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon its ability to exploit its mineral holdings, generate revenue from its planned business operations and control exploration cost.  Should the Company be unable to raise adequate capital or to meet the other above objectives, it is likely that the Company would have to substantially curtail its business activity, and that the Company's investors would incur substantial losses of their investment. 
   
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements the Company is an independent oil and gas company with a limited operating history and losses since inception. These factors, among others, may indicate that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for reasonable period of time. 
   
 The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, and ultimately, to attain profitability. The Company intends to acquire additional operating capital through debt or equity offerings, or through joint ventures or other business arrangements, to fund its business plan.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional funds. 
   
  Cash Flows:   Net cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to the conveyance of the Crosby, North Dakota wells to Vast Exploration, LLC, a related party.   For the three months ending at December 31, 2015, cash used by operating activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities by $82,255.  For the three months ending at December 31, 2014, cash used by operating activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities by $95,446. 

22 

Cash flows used by investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was $26 and $24. 
   
 The Cash flows provided from financing activities were $82,281 and $Nil for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   The Company entered into a Line of Credit agreement with related party Vast Exploration, LLC as a means to provide cash flow for ongoing capital needs of the Company.   
   
  Commitments:  As noted in Item 3 of this report, on or about August 1, 2013, the North Dakota Industrial Commission ( NDIC ) submitted an administrative complaint to the State of North Dakota related to plugging and remediation of the Company s Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells in Crosby, ND.  The administrative complaint alleges the Company violated certain portions of the North Dakota Century Code and request administrative relief against the Company for violation of sections of the North Dakota Administrative Code governing the oil and gas industry. 
   
 On February 18, 2014, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement with the State of North Dakota whereby the Company was required to finish reclamation work, by June 30, 2014, on the two waste water storage pits adjacent to the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 wells respectively.  The Consent Agreement required the Company to plug the  production zone  of the Jenks #1 well. Once plugging was completed, the Company could then apply for a permit to convert the Jenks #1 well into a salt water disposal well.  As a part of the Consent Agreement the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of no less than $105,000, consisting of $25,000 due and payable upon execution of the Consent Agreement and a $16,000 installment payment per month for five successive months thereafter.  If the Company failed to comply with the terms of the Consent Agreement, the Company would be subject to penalties of up to an additional $420,000 (over and above the $105,000 penalty agreed to in the Consent Agreement). The Company made the initial $25,000 payment and subsequently made each monthly payment with the final installment of $16,000 paid to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.   
   
 The Company made the final installment payment of $16,000 to the State of North Dakota on June 26, 2014.  As of September 30, 2014, the Company has completed substantially all reclamation work and has paid all fines assessed. 
   
 On July 10, 2014, the Company completed reclamation work on both the Jenks #1 and Knudsen #1 waste water storage pits.  Although reclamation work was to have been completed by June 30, 2014, unseasonably heavy rains saturated the soil and limited safe access to the site by heavy equipment delayed scheduled reclamation until such time as ground conditions improved. The Company also completed plugging of the  production zone  on the Jenks #1 well and set a balance plug on the Knudsen #1 well bore.   
   
 Due to the Company s failure to timely submit a cost estimate for the final plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1 well and site, the NDIC, on January 28, 2015, pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588 ordered JayHawk to file a $120,000 bond covering the Jenks #1. The bond was a plugging and reclamation bond.  
   
 On May 9, 2015, the Company received a copy of a Summons and Complaint filed by the State of North Dakota and the NDIC in the Northwest Judicial District Court of North Dakota alleging JayHawk had violated N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08 by failing to post the $120,000 plugging and reclamation bond pursuant to Commission Order No. 25588. N.D.C.C.   38-08-16 provides that anyone who violates a provision of N.D.C.C. Chapter 38-08, or any rule or regulation of the Commission is subject to a penalty of up to $12,500 for each offense, and each day s violation is a separate offense. The Complaint s prayer for relief requested that JayHawk be ordered to deposit $120,000 with the Bank of North Dakota to satisfy the Commission s requirement for the plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1 well. The NDIC also requested that JayHawk pay a fine of $12,500 per day beginning February 4, 2015, for failure to provide a plugging and reclamation bond on the Jenks #1. Company management subsequently met with the NDIC, which resulted in the NDIC staying the litigation subject to JayHawk s immediate plugging, abandonment and reclamation of the Jenks #1. In September of 2015 the Company completed final plugging and abandonment of the Jenks #1 and completed a partial reclamation of the well and site.  
   
 On February 12, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Staff of the Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas with respect to a Penalty Order served by the Company for failure to comply with certain portions of the Kansas Administrative Regulations.  The Company was found in violation of failure to plug, return to service or temporarily abandon 71 wells and assessed a $7,100 penalty, of which $3,100 was payable immediately, a $2,000 payment due by April 1, 2015 and the final $2,000 payment by May 1, 2015.  The Company has subsequently submitted seventy-one (71) temporary abandonment applications, of which seventy-one (71 applications were approved.  The Company has up to one year to plug the wells, return them to service or file additional temporary abandonment applications.   
   
 Subsequent to the report date covering the period ending December 31, 2015, on August 29, 2016, the complaint by the North Dakota Industrial Commission was dismissed without prejudice.  Consequently, the contingency related to reclamation of the Jenks and Knudsen well sites has been relieved.  

23 

At December 31, 2015, the Company has no commitments to make any capital expenditures.  Any potential future capital expenditures will be dependent on concluding adequate and successful financing arrangements. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.   
   
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
   
 Not required for Smaller Reporting Companies.  
   
    Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
   
 (a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by JayHawk s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2015.  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, JayHawk s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
   
 Management of JayHawk Energy, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
   
     Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 
   
     Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and 
   
     Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
   
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
   
 The Company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). As a result of this assessment, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. 
   
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
   
 The material weakness identified is described below: 

24 

Due to insufficient staffing, it was not possible to ensure appropriate segregation of duties between incompatible functions, and formalized monitoring procedures have not been established or implemented. 
   
 As a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015,  the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
   
 This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Company was not required to have, nor has it, engaged its independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this quarterly report 
   
  (b)  Changes in Internal Controls    Our management, including the CEO and CFO, identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company agreed to provide the director with the following consideration:  
   
 The Company will execute a convertible promissory note with a face value of $177,173 to the director and/or assigns; the note will have a term of four (4) years and an interest rate of null (0%) and includes certain interest penalties in the event a default occurs and is secured by a pledge of 350,000 shares of the Company s common stock ( Note ).

All notices and other communications given to any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be hand delivered, or sent either by (a) certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; (b) an overnight express courier service that provides written confirmation of delivery; (c) facsimile or other electronic transmission with written confirmation by the sending machine or with telephone or e-mail confirmation of receipt.  
   
   11.  
  Usury Savings Clause .  It is the intention of the Company and the Holder to comply with applicable state and federal usury laws from time to time in effect.  Accordingly, notwithstanding any   provision to the contrary in this Note   or any   other document related hereto, in no event (including, but not limited to, prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation) shall this Note or any such other document require the payment or permit the collection or receipt of interest in excess of the highest lawful rate.  If under any circumstance whatsoever,   any provision of this Note or of any other document pertaining hereto   shall provide for the payment, collection or receipt of interest in excess of the highest lawful rate, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any such circumstances the Holder shall ever receive anything of value as interest or deemed   interest by applicable law under this Note or any other document pertaining hereto or otherwise an amount that would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount that would exceed the highest lawful rate shall be applied to the reduction of the Principal Amount and accrued Interest outstanding hereunder or on account of any other indebtedness of the Holder to the Company, and not to the payment of Interest, or if such excessive Interest exceeds the unpaid Principal Amount outstanding hereunder and such other indebtedness, such excess shall be refunded to the Company.  In determining whether or not the Interest paid or payable with respect to any indebtedness of the Company to the Holder, under any specified contingency, exceeds the highest lawful rate, the Company shall, to the  

5 

maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any non-Principal Amount payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest, (ii) exclude prepayments and the effects thereof, (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total amount of Interest throughout the full term of such indebtedness (including any extension or renewal) so that Interest thereon does not exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, and/or (iv) allocate Interest between portions of such indebtedness, to the end that no such portion shall bear Interest at a rate greater than that permitted by applicable law.  The Holder expressly disavows any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned Interest or finance charges in the event that the maturity of this Note is accelerated.  If at any time the Interest rate set forth in  Section 1  hereof exceeds the highest lawful rate, then the rate at which Interest shall accrue hereunder shall automatically be limited to the highest lawful rate, and shall remain at the highest lawful rate until the total amount of Interest accrued hereunder equals the total amount of Interest that would have accrued but for the operation of this sentence.  Thereafter, Interest shall accrue at the Interest rate set forth in  Section 1  hereof unless and until such Interest rate again exceeds the highest lawful rate, in which case the immediately preceding sentence shall apply. 
   
   12.  
  No Shareholder Rights . Except as otherwise stated herein, nothing contained in this Note shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder or any other person the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder of the Company. 
   
   13.  
  No Violation of Law . This Note may not be converted if its conversion would cause the Company to violate an exemption from registration or would violate any applicable state or federal securities law, any registration under or any requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules of an exchange on which the Company s securities may be traded, any other federal law, or any state securities laws. 
   
   14.  
  Piggyback Registration Rights . The Company grants the Holder piggyback registration rights for the shares underlying the Note in any registration statement which the Company may file during 2016 or 2017.  
   
  15.  
  Anti-Dilution Rights . Should at any time from the date of making this Note until the conversion of the Note, the Company issue a stock dividend, combine outstanding shares into a lessor number of shares (reverse split) or increase the number of outstanding shares without a receipt of new consideration (forward split) then the number of shares into which the Note may be converted and the conversion price shall be adjusted to reflect such event so that the relative interest of the Holder shall be fully protected from dilution resulting from such an event.  Notice of the required adjustment including the number of shares and the new conversion price shall be promptly mailed to each Holder subsequent to each such adjustment event.  In no event shall the conversion price be more than $0.0065per share of Common Stock. 
   
   16.  
  Headings .  The headings of the sections of this Note are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Note.

 RECITALS: 
 WHEREAS, certain events have occurred that have led the Parties to disagree about their working relationship and compensation owed to Stopher (the  Dispute ). The Dispute includes the repayment of the Old Notes (described below), as well as certain Invoices (described below).   
 WHEREAS, the Company entered into certain promissory notes with Stopher, including, a $110,781 promissory note on September 30, 2015; a $10,392.63 promissory note on February 29, 2016 and is owed roughly fifty-seven thousand dollars ($57,000) as a result of a  change in  control  provision stemming from his prior employment contract with JayHawk Energy, Inc., (collectively, the  Old Notes ).  
 WHEREAS, the Company entered into a written Services Agreement with Stopher on January 1, 2016 under which Stopher claims outstanding invoices in the amount of roughly forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000). The Company also entered into an oral agreement for certain book keeping services under which Stopher claims outstanding invoices in the amount of roughly twenty-one thousand dollars ($21,000) (collectively, the  Invoices ).  
 WHEREAS, Stopher is a member of the Board of Directors of JayHawk Energy, Inc.

Exhibit 10.8 

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT   
   
  THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ) is entered into as of the date executed below, by and between    JayHawk Energy, Inc   ., a Nevada corporation (the  Company  or  JayHawk ), and    _______________________________________   ( Indemnitee ). For purposes of this Agreement, the  Company  shall be deemed to include JayHawk and its subsidiaries, as appropriate.  
  WHEREAS, in order to induce Indemnitee to provide, or continue to provide, services to the Company, the Company wishes to provide for the indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, Indemnitee to the maximum extent permitted by law;  
  WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and the Indemnitee and other directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries of the Company may not be willing to continue to serve in such capacities without additional protection;  
  WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that Indemnitee will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that he will not be so indemnified.  
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and Indemnitee s agreement to provide, or continue to provide, services to the Company, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as set forth below.  
    1.   
   Certain Definitions   .  
   
   a.  
   Claim  shall mean any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism, or any hearing, inquiry or investigation that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism, whether civil, criminal, administrative, whether formal or informal, investigative or other.  
   
   b.  
  References to the  Company  shall include, in addition to JayHawk, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger to which JayHawk (or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) is a party which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries, so that if Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, Indemnitee shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as Indemnitee would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.  
   
   c.  
   Expenses  shall mean any and all expenses (including attorneys  fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations) incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in, any action, suit, proceeding, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, hearing, inquiry or investigation, whether formal or informal.  

1 

d.  
   Expense Advance  shall mean an advance payment of Expenses to Indemnitee pursuant to Section 3(a).  
   
   e.  
   Indemnifiable Event  shall mean any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Indemnitee while serving in such capacity.  
   
   f.  
   Independent Directors  shall mean those members of the Board consisting of directors who are not parties to the Claim.  
   
   g.

   h.  
   Other Liabilities  shall mean judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of any Claim regarding any Indemnifiable Event and any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on the Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement.  
   
   i.

2 

Indemnifiable Event against Expenses and Other Liabilities, including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses. Indemnitee hereby agrees to repay to the Company all amounts advanced to Indemnitee hereunder if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. Other than in respect of Expense Advances paid in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof, such payment of Expenses shall be made by the Company as soon as practicable but in any event no later than five (5) business days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented to the Company.  
   
    b.   
   Determination of Right to Indemnification   . Unless otherwise provided in Section 11 hereof, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee pursuant to Section 2(a) if Indemnitee has not failed to meet the applicable standard of conduct for indemnification. With respect to all matters arising concerning whether or not the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select the Reviewing Party. The Reviewing Party shall determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and the Company and Indemnitee agree to abide by such determination, which, if made by Independent Legal Counsel shall be made in a written opinion.  
   
    c.   
   Mandatory Payment of Expenses   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement other than Section 11 hereof, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any Claim regarding any Indemnifiable Event, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith.  
   
    3.   
   Expenses; Indemnification Procedure   .  
   
    a.   
   Advancement of Expenses   . The Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee. The advances to be made hereunder shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee as soon as practicable but in any event no later than five (5) business days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor to the Company. Indemnitee hereby agrees to repay to the Company all amounts advanced to Indemnitee hereunder if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Company s obligation to advance Expenses shall terminate with respect to any Claim as to which the Indemnitee shall have entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or an equivalent plea acknowledging guilt.  
   
    b.   
   Notice/Cooperation by Indemnitee   . Indemnitee shall, as a condition precedent to Indemnitee s right to be indemnified under this Agreement, give the Company notice in writing as soon as practicable of any Claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement; provided however that the failure to so provide notice to the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee hereunder unless the Company s ability to participate in the defense of such claim was materially and adversely affected by such failure. Notice to the Company shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the address shown on the signature page of this Agreement (or such other address as the Company shall designate in writing to Indemnitee). In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitee s power, to the extent that doing so is consistent with the exercise of the Indemnitee s rights under the federal and state Constitutions.   

3 

Company shall provide Indemnitee with such information and cooperation as Indemnitee may reasonably require, to the extent that doing so is consistent with the Company s obligation to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement agencies.  
   
    c.   
   No Presumptions; Burden of Proof.    For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  
   
    d.   
   Notice to Insurers   . If, at the time of the receipt by the Company of a notice of a Claim pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof, the Company has liability insurance in effect which may cover such Claim, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Claim to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Claim in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company shall keep Indemnitee reasonably informed as to the status of all relevant insurance matters.  
   
    e.   
   Selection of Counsel   . In the event the Company shall be obligated hereunder to pay the Expenses of any Claim the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Claim with counsel approved by Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld) upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of the Company s election so to do. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Claim; provided that, (i) Indemnitee shall have the right to employ Indemnitee s separate counsel in any such Claim at Indemnitee s own expense and (ii) if (A) the employment of separate counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense, or (C) the Company shall not continue to retain such counsel to defend such Claim, then the fees and expenses of Indemnitee s separate counsel shall be considered an Expense.  
   
    4.   
   Additional Indemnification Rights; Non-exclusivity; Company Obligations Primary   .  
   
    a.   
   Scope   . The Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company s Articles of Incorporation, the Company s Bylaws (as now or hereafter in effect) or by statute. In the event of any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or rule which expands the right of a Nevada corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits afforded by such change. In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Nevada corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, such change, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this   

4 

Agreement or the parties  rights and obligations hereunder except as set forth in Section 11(a) hereof.  
   
    b.   
   Non-exclusivity   . The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall be in addition to any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Company s Articles of Incorporation, its Bylaws (as now hereafter in effect), any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the Nevada Revised Statutes or otherwise. The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action taken or not taken while serving in an indemnified capacity even though Indemnitee may have ceased to serve in such capacity.  
   
    5.   
   Contribution   .  
   
   a.  
  Whether or not the indemnification provided in Section 2 hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall, unless indemnification would not be available as a result of Section 11 hereof, pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee. The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against Indemnitee.  
   
   b.  
  Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding subparagraph, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of expenses (including attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; provided, however, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events that resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which the Law may require to be considered. The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.  

5 

c.  
  The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.  
   
   d.  
  To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever other than the reasons set forth in Section 11 hereof, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses and Other Liabilities, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors (other than Indemnitee) officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).  
   
    6.   
   Settlement   . The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty. In the event that any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof.  
   
    7.   
   No Duplication of Payments   . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, provision of the Company s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaw (as now or hereafter in effect) or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.  
   
    8.   
   Partial Indemnification   . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses or Other Liabilities incurred in connection with any Claim, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses and Other Liabilities to which Indemnitee is entitled.  
   
    9.   
   No Imputation   . The knowledge or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or the Company itself shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  
   
    10.   
   Liability Insurance   . For the duration of Indemnitee s service as a director or officer or other agent of the Company, and thereafter for so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any pending or possible Claim by reason of any Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the scope and amount of coverage available relative to the cost thereof) to cause to be maintained in effect policies of liability insurance providing coverage for directors and officers of the Company that are at least substantially comparable in scope and amount to that provided by the Company s current policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance. To the extent the Company maintains liability insurance applicable to directors,   

6 

officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policies in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are provided to the most favorably insured of the Company s directors, if Indemnitee is a director; or of the Company s officers, if Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer; or of the Company s key employees, agents or fiduciaries, if Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee, agent or fiduciary.  
   
    11.   
   Exceptions   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:  
   
    a.   
   Excluded Action or Omissions   . To indemnify Indemnitee for acts, omissions or transactions if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law.  
   
    b.   
   Claims Initiated by Indemnitee   . To indemnify Expenses or Other Liabilities or advance Expenses to Indemnitee with respect to Claims initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except (i) with respect to actions or proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other agreement or insurance policy or under the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, (ii) in specific cases if the Board of Directors has approved the initiation or bringing of such Claim, or (iii) as otherwise required under the Nevada Revised Statutes, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance Expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.  
   
    c.   
   Lack of Good Faith   . To indemnify Indemnitee for any Expenses or Other Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous.  
   
    d.   
   Claims Under Section 16(b)   . To indemnify Indemnitee for the payment of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute; provided that the Company shall advance Expenses in connection with Indemnitee s defense of a claim under Section 16(b), which advances shall be repaid to the Company if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification of such Expenses.  
   
    12.   
   Period of Limitations   . No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee s estate, spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action, such shorter period shall govern.  
   
    13.   
   Counterparts   . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original.  

7 

14.   
   Binding Effect; Successors and Assigns   . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), spouses, heirs and personal and legal representatives. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect, and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary (as applicable) of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company s request.  
   
    15.   
   Attorneys  Fees   . In the event that any action is instituted by Indemnitee under this Agreement or under any liability insurance policies maintained by the Company to enforce or interpret any of the terms hereof or thereof, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such action, regardless of whether Indemnitee is ultimately successful in such action, and shall be entitled to the advancement of Expenses with respect to such action, unless as a part of such action a court of competent jurisdiction over such action determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee as a basis for such action was not made in good faith or was frivolous. In the event of an action instituted by or in the name of the Company under this Agreement to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in defense of such action (including costs and Expenses incurred with respect to Indemnitee s counterclaims and cross-claims made in such action), and shall be entitled to the advancement of Expenses with respect to such action.  
   
    16.   
   Notice   . All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (i) if delivered by hand and signed for by the party addressed, on the date of such delivery, or (ii) if mailed by domestic certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date postmarked, or (iii) if sent by electronic mail, on the day sent with a confirmation of receipt. Addresses for notice to either party are as shown on the signature page of this Agreement, or as subsequently modified by written notice.  
   
    17.   
   Consent to Jurisdiction   . The Company and Indemnitee each hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Nevada for all purposes in connection with any action or proceeding which arises out of or relates to this Agreement and agree that any action instituted under this Agreement shall be commenced, prosecuted and continued only in the District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County, which shall be the exclusive and only proper forum for adjudicating such a claim.  
   
    18.   
   Severability   . The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitations, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, which is not itself invalid, void or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.  

8 

19.   
   Choice of Law   . This Agreement shall be governed by and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada as applied to contracts between Nevada residents entered into and to be performed entirely within the State of Nevada.  
   
    20.   
   Subrogation   . In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all documents required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure such rights and to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  
   
    21.   
   Amendment and Termination   . Due to the uncertain application of any statutes of limitations that may govern any Claim, this Agreement shall be of indefinite duration. No amendment, modification, termination or cancellation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing signed by both the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  
   
    22.   
   Integration and Entire Agreement   . This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes and merges all previous written and oral negotiations, commitments, understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof between the parties hereto. If the Company and Indemnitee have previously entered into an indemnification agreement providing for indemnification of Indemnitee by the Company, the parties  entry into this Indemnification Agreement shall be deemed to amend and restate such Indemnification Agreement to read in its entirety as, and to be superseded by, this Indemnification Agreement.  
   
    23.   
   No Construction as Employment Agreement   . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving Indemnitee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities.  
   
    24.   
   Retroactive Application   . This Agreement shall be deemed retroactively effective to the date upon which the Company s Board of Directors or shareholders appointed an Indemnitee to its position with the Company.
