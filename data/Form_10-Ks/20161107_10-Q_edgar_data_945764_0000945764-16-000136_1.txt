Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  Organization and Nature of Operations 
    
  Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company with operations focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO   2    enhanced oil recovery operations. 
    
  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Denbury Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements.  These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  Form 10-K ).  Unless indicated otherwise or the context requires, the terms  we,   our,   us,   Company  or  Denbury,  refer to Denbury Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
    
  Accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve greater reliance on estimates than at year end, and the results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.  In management s opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders  equity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  On the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, (1) debt issuance costs associated with our senior subordinated notes have been reclassified from  Other assets  to  Long-term debt, net of current portion  and (2) deferred tax assets have been reclassified from  Deferred tax assets, net  to  Deferred tax liabilities, net.   Such reclassifications were made as a result of our adoption of new accounting pronouncements described in   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Recently Adopted   below and had no impact on our previously reported net income or cash flows. 
    
  Net Loss per Common Share 
    
  Basic   net loss per common share   is computed by dividing the   net loss   attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted   net loss   per common share is calculated in the same manner, but includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities.  Potentially dilutive securities consist of nonvested restricted stock, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), and nonvested performance-based equity awards.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no adjustments to   net loss   for purposes of calculating basic and diluted   net loss per common share  .

Table of Contents  
  Denbury Resources Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted   net loss per common share   calculations for the periods indicated: 

Basic weighted average common shares exclude shares of nonvested restricted stock.  As these restricted shares vest, they will be included in the shares outstanding used to calculate basic   net loss per common share   (although time-vesting restricted stock is issued and outstanding upon grant).  
    
  The following securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would have been antidilutive: 

Write-Down of Oil and Natural Gas Properties    
    
  The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.  The cost center ceiling is defined as (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10%), based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects.  Our future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO   2    reserves nor those related to the cost of constructing CO   2    pipelines, as we do not have to incur additional costs to develop the proved oil and natural gas reserves.  Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO   2    costs related to CO   2    reserves and CO   2    pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves.  The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes.  The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly. 
    
  The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves has followed a precipitous and continuing decline in oil prices throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, and the average has declined from   $59.21   per Bbl for the third quarter of 2015 to   $41.68   per Bbl for the third quarter of 2016.  In addition, the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX natural gas price used in estimating our proved reserves was   $3.04   per MMBtu for the third quarter of 2015 and   $2.36   per MMBtu for the third quarter of 2016.  These falling prices have led to our recognizing full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of   $75.5 million  ,   $479.4 million  , and   $256.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30  , June 30, and March 31, 2016, respectively, and   $1.8 billion  ,   $1.7 billion  , and   $146.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30  , June 30, and March 31, 2015, respectively.

2015 Impairment of Goodwill 
    
  We are required to test goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of   $1.3 billion   during the three months ended September 30, 2015, to fully impair the carrying value of our goodwill. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recently Adopted 
    
  Stock Compensation.    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.  The standard contains various amendments, each requiring a specific method of adoption, and designates whether each amendment should be adopted using a retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective transition method.  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09.  The amendments within ASU 2016-09 related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized and accounting for forfeitures were adopted using a modified retrospective method.  In accordance with this method, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2016, relating to the timing of recognition of excess tax benefits, representing a   $15.7 million   reduction to beginning  Accumulated deficit  with the offset to  Deferred tax liabilities, net  (  $14.8 million  ) and  Other current assets  (  $0.8 million  ).  We also recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2016, to reflect actual forfeitures versus the previously-estimated forfeiture rate, representing a   $0.4 million   reduction to  Accumulated deficit  with the offset to  Paid-in capital in excess of par.   The amendments within ASU 2016-09 related to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax shortfalls in the income statement and presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows were adopted prospectively, with no adjustments made to prior periods. 
    
  Income Taxes.    In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ).  ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.  Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively to each period presented or prospectively.  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-17, which has been applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.  Accordingly, current deferred tax assets of   $1.5 million   have been reclassified from  Deferred tax assets, net  to  Deferred tax liabilities, net  in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Debt Issuance Costs.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ).  ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of that debt in the balance sheet, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Entities are required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis to each period presented as a change in accounting principle.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest       Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-15 ) which amends ASU 2015-03 to clarify the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements, such that entities may continue to apply current practice.  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, which have been applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.  Accordingly, debt issuance costs of   $32.8 million   associated with our previously issued senior subordinated notes have been reclassified from  Other assets  to  Long-term debt, net of current portion  in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any periods. 
    
  Not Yet Adopted 
    
  Leases.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  ASU 2016-02 amends the guidance for lease accounting to require lease assets and liabilities to be recognized on the balance sheet, along with additional disclosures  

10 

Table of Contents

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

regarding key leasing arrangements.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.  Entities must adopt the standard using a modified retrospective transition and apply the guidance to the earliest comparative period presented, with certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition.    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ).  ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements.  The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.  The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.  The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2015-14 ) which amends ASU 2014-09 and delays the effective date for public companies, such that the amendments in the ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption will be permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued four additional ASUs which primarily clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, performance obligations and licensing, collectibility, presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, and non-cash consideration.  Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Going Concern.    In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ).  ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in United States auditing standards.  The amendments in this ASU will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter.  We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 2. Long-Term Debt 
    
  The following long-term debt and capital lease obligations were outstanding as of the dates indicated: 

11 

Table of Contents  
  Denbury Resources Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

(1) 
    Future interest payable on our 9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Senior Secured Notes ) represents most of the interest due over the term of this obligation, which has been accounted for as debt in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification ( FASC ) 470-60,   Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors  .  Our current maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 include   $51.0 million   of future interest payable related to the 2021 Senior Secured Notes that is due within the next twelve months.  See   2016 Senior Subordinated Notes Exchange   below for further discussion. 
       
  The ultimate parent company in our corporate structure, Denbury Resources Inc. ( DRI ), is the sole issuer of all of our outstanding senior secured second lien notes and senior subordinated notes.  DRI has no independent assets or operations.  Each of the subsidiary guarantors of such notes is   100%   owned, directly or indirectly, by DRI, and the guarantees of the notes are full and unconditional and joint and several; any subsidiaries of DRI that are not subsidiary guarantors of such notes are minor subsidiaries. 
    
  Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility 
    
  In   December 2014  , we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (the  Bank Credit Agreement ).  The Bank Credit Agreement is a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 9, 2019.  In October 2016, as part of our semiannual borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base and lender commitments for our Bank Credit Agreement were reaffirmed at   $1.05 billion  , with the next such redetermination scheduled for May 2017. 
    
  In order to provide more flexibility in managing our balance sheet, the credit extended by our lenders, and continuing compliance with maintenance financial covenants in this low oil price environment, we entered into three amendments to the Bank Credit Agreement between May 2015 and April 2016 that modified the Bank Credit Agreement as follows: 

for 2016 and 2017, the maximum permitted ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated EBITDAX covenant has been suspended and replaced by a maximum permitted ratio of consolidated senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDAX covenant of   3.0   to 1.0 (only debt under our Bank Credit Agreement is considered consolidated senior secured debt for purposes of this ratio); 
                  
    allows for the incurrence of up to   $1.0 billion   of junior lien debt (subject to customary requirements), with   $385.1 million   of future incurrence available as of   September 30, 2016  ; 
                
    limits unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to   $225 million   if more than   $250 million   of borrowings are outstanding under the Bank Credit Agreement; and 
                
    limits the amount spent on repurchases or other redemptions of our senior subordinated notes to   $225 million  , with up to   $148.3 million   of this capacity remaining available as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Additionally, such amendments made the following changes to the Bank Credit Agreement: (1) increased the applicable margin for ABR Loans and LIBOR Loans by 75 basis points such that the margin for ABR Loans now ranges from   1%   to   2%   per annum and the margin for LIBOR Loans now ranges from   2%   to   3%   per annum, (2) increased the commitment fee rate to   0.50%  , and (3) provided for semiannual scheduled redeterminations of the borrowing base in May and November of each year.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Bank Credit Agreement.  The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , under the Bank Credit Agreement was   2.8%  . 
    
  The above description of our Bank Credit Agreement financial covenants and the changes provided for within the three amendments are qualified by the express language and defined terms contained in the Bank Credit Agreement, the First Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated May 4, 2015, the Second Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated February 17, 2016, and the Third Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated April 18, 2016, each of which are filed as exhibits to our periodic reports filed with the SEC.

  During May 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements to exchange a total of   $1,057.8 million   of our existing senior subordinated notes for   $614.9 million   principal amount of our 2021 Senior Secured Notes plus   40.7 million   shares of Denbury common stock, resulting in a net reduction from these exchanges of   $442.9 million   in our debt principal.  The exchanged notes consisted of   $175.1 million   principal amount of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ),   $411.0 million   principal amount of our 5 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ), and   $471.7 million   principal amount of our 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes ). 
    
  In accordance with FASC 470-60, the exchanges were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring due to the level of concession provided by our lenders.  Under this guidance, future interest applicable to the 2021 Senior Secured Notes is recorded as debt up to the point that the principal and future interest of the new notes is equal to the principal amount of the extinguished notes, rather than recognizing a gain on extinguishment for this amount.  As a result,   $254.7 million   of future interest on the 2021 Senior Secured Notes was recorded as debt, which will be reduced as semiannual interest payments are made, with the remaining   $22.8 million   of future interest to be recognized as interest expense over the term of these notes.  Therefore, future interest expense reflected in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations on the 2021 Senior Secured Notes will be significantly lower than the actual cash interest payments.  In addition, we recognized a gain of   $12.0 million   as a result of this debt exchange during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is included in  Gain on debt extinguishment  in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 
    
  In May 2016, we issued   $614.9 million   of 2021 Senior Secured Notes.  The 2021 Senior Secured Notes, which bear interest at a rate of 9% per annum, were issued at par in connection with privately negotiated exchanges with a limited number of holders of   $1,057.8 million   of existing senior subordinated notes (see   2016 Senior Subordinated Notes Exchange   above).  The 2021 Senior Secured Notes mature on May 15, 2021, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2016.  We may redeem the 2021 Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at our option beginning December 15, 2018, at a redemption price of   109%   of the principal amount, and at declining redemption prices thereafter, as specified in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Secured Notes (the  Indenture ).  Prior to December 15, 2018, we may at our option redeem up to an aggregate of   35%   of the principal amount of the 2021 Senior Secured Notes at a price of   109%   of par with the proceeds of certain equity offerings.  In addition, at any time prior to December 15, 2018, we may redeem the 2021 Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest.  The 2021 Senior Secured Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. 
    
  The Indenture contains customary covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (1) incur additional debt; (2) make investments; (3) create liens on our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries; (4) create limitations on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to DRI or other restricted subsidiaries; (5) engage in transactions with our affiliates; (6) transfer or sell assets or subsidiary stock; (7) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries; and (8) make restricted payments (which includes paying dividends on our common stock or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring such stock or subordinated debt (including existing senior subordinated notes)), provided that in certain circumstances we may make unlimited restricted payments so long as we maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Indenture) not to exceed   2.5   to 1.0 (both before and after giving effect to any restricted payment). 
    
  The 2021 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed jointly and severally by our subsidiaries representing substantially all of our assets, operations and income and are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of the assets that secure the Bank Credit Agreement, which second-priority liens are contractually subordinated to liens that secure our Bank Credit Agreement and any future additional priority lien debt. 
    
  2016 Repurchases of Senior Subordinated Notes 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased a total of   $152.3 million   of our outstanding long-term indebtedness, consisting of   $4.0 million   principal amount of our 2021 Notes,   $42.3 million   principal amount of our 2022 Notes, and   $106.0 million   principal amount of our 2023 Notes in open-market transactions for a total purchase price of   $55.5 million  , excluding accrued interest.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased an additional   $29.6 million   of senior subordinated notes in open-market transactions, consisting of   $5.8 million   principal amount of our 2021 Notes and   $23.8 million   principal amount of our 2022 Notes, for a total purchase price of   $21.2 million  , excluding accrued interest.  In connection with these series of transactions, we recognized a   $103.1 million   gain on extinguishment, net of unamortized debt issuance costs written off, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As of November 2, 2016, under the Bank Credit Agreement, up to an additional   $148.3 million   may be spent on repurchases or other redemptions of our senior subordinated notes. 

Note 3. Income Taxes 
    
  We evaluate our estimated annual effective income tax rate based on current and forecasted business results and enacted tax laws on a quarterly basis and apply this tax rate to our ordinary income or loss to calculate our estimated tax liability or benefit.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $34.5 million   of deferred tax assets associated with State of Louisiana net operating losses.  As the result of a new tax law enacted in the State of Louisiana effective June 30, 2015, which limits a company s utilization of certain deductions, including our net operating loss carryforwards, we recognized tax valuation allowances totaling   $33.6 million   during 2015 and an additional   $0.9 million   during the first quarter of 2016, which reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets.  The valuation allowances will remain until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an unrecognized tax benefit of   $5.4 million   related to an uncertain tax position.  The unrecognized tax benefit was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a direct reduction of the associated deferred tax asset and, if recognized, would not materially affect our annual effective tax rate.  The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position.  We currently do not expect a material change to the uncertain tax position within the next 12 months.  Our policy is to recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense; however, no such amounts were accrued related to the uncertain tax position as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  In connection with the privately negotiated exchange agreements to exchange a portion of our existing senior subordinated notes for 2021 Senior Secured Notes, we realized a tax gain due to the concession extended by our note holders during the second quarter of 2016.  This tax gain was offset by net operating losses and other deferred tax asset attributes. 

Note 4. Stockholders  Equity 
    
  Dividends Declared During 2015 
    
  During the first three quarters of 2015, the Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of   $0.0625   per common share, with dividends totaling   $65.4 million   paid to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  In September 2015, in light of the continuing low oil price environment and our desire to maintain our financial strength and flexibility, the Company s Board of Directors suspended our quarterly cash dividend. 

Note 5. Commodity Derivative Contracts 
    
  We do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts; therefore, the changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized in income in the period of change.  These fair value changes, along with the settlements of expired contracts, are shown under  Commodity derivatives expense (income)  in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Historically, we have entered into various oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Generally, these contracts have consisted of various combinations of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps and fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put.  The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt, financial strength and expectation of future commodity prices. 
    
  We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification, and all of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our Bank

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Credit Agreement (or affiliates of such lenders).  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our outstanding derivative contracts were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements whereby payables on those contracts can be offset against receivables from separate derivative contracts with the same counterparty.  It is our policy to classify derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our balance sheets, even if the contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. 
    
  The following table summarizes our commodity derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016  , none of which are classified as hedging instruments in accordance with the FASC   Derivatives and Hedging   topic: 

(1) 
    Ranges presented for fixed-price swaps represent the lowest and highest fixed prices of all open contracts for the period presented.  For collars and three-way collars, ranges represent the lowest floor price and highest ceiling price for all open contracts for the period presented. 
              (2) 
    A three-way collar is a costless collar contract combined with a sold put feature (at a lower price) with the same counterparty.  The value received for the sold put is used to enhance the contracted floor and ceiling price of the related collar.  At the contract settlement date, (1) if the index price is higher than the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty the difference between the index price and ceiling price for the contracted volumes, (2) if the index price is between the floor and ceiling price, no settlements occur, (3) if the index price is lower than the floor price but at or above the sold put price, the counterparty pays us the difference between the index price and the floor price for the contracted volumes and (4) if the index price is lower than the sold put price, the counterparty pays us the difference between the floor price and the sold put price for the contracted volumes. 

Note 6. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The FASC   Fair Value Measurement   topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred to as the  exit price ).  We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.  These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.  We primarily apply the income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available information.  Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs.  The FASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy  

15 

Table of Contents  
  Denbury Resources Inc. 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 

Level 2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.  Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.  Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded oil derivatives that are based on NYMEX pricing and fixed-price swaps that are based on regional pricing other than NYMEX (e.g., Light Louisiana Sweet).  Our costless collars and the sold put features of our three-way collars are valued using the Black-Scholes model, an industry standard option valuation model that takes into account inputs such as contractual prices for the underlying instruments, maturity, quoted forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors and credit worthiness, as well as other relevant economic measures.  Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. 

Level 3   Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable.  These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.  At   September 30, 2016  , instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded costless collars and three-way collars that are based on regional pricing other than NYMEX (e.g., Light Louisiana Sweet).  The valuation models utilized for costless collars and three-way collars are consistent with the methodologies described above; however, the implied volatilities utilized in the valuation of Level 3 instruments are developed using a benchmark, which is considered a significant unobservable input.  An increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the implied volatility inputs utilized in our fair value measurement would result in a change of approximately   $43 thousand   in the fair value of these instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  We adjust the valuations from the valuation model for nonperformance risk, using our estimate of the counterparty s credit quality for asset positions and our credit quality for liability positions.  We use multiple sources of third-party credit data in determining counterparty nonperformance risk, including credit default swaps. 
    
  The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of the periods indicated:

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Since we do not apply hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, any gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are included in  Commodity derivatives expense (income)  in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

We utilize an income approach to value our Level 3 costless collars and three-way collars.  We obtain and ensure the appropriateness of the significant inputs to the calculation, including contractual prices for the underlying instruments, maturity, forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors and credit worthiness, and the fair value estimate is prepared and reviewed on a quarterly basis.  The following table details fair value inputs related to implied volatilities utilized in the valuation of our Level 3 oil derivative contracts:

Other Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The carrying value of our loans under our Bank Credit Agreement approximate fair value, as they are subject to short-term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to us for those periods.  We use a market approach to determine the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt using observable market data.  The fair values of our senior secured second lien notes and senior subordinated notes are based on quoted market prices.  The estimated fair value of the principal amount of our debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , excluding pipeline financing and capital lease obligations, was   $2,010.3 million   and   $1,119.0 million  , respectively, which increase is primarily driven by an increase in quoted market prices.  We have other financial instruments consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term receivables and payables that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and the relatively short maturities. 

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Commitments 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, we amended our CO   2    offtake agreement with Mississippi Power Company ( MSPC ), which amendment included increasing our offtake percentage from   70%   to   100%   of CO   2    quantities produced and lowering the base price related to the cost of CO   2   , deliveries of which are currently expected to begin in late 2016 or early 2017.  Based on the amended terms in the agreement, we concluded for accounting purposes that the agreement contains an embedded lease related to the pipeline

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

owned by MSPC used to transport CO   2    to Denbury.  We currently plan to record a capital lease on the balance sheet of approximately   $110 million   upon lease commencement. 
    
  Litigation 
    
  We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses.  We are also subject to audits for various taxes (income, sales and use, and severance) in the various states in which we operate, and from time to time receive assessments for potential taxes that we may owe.  While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties.  Although a single or multiple adverse rulings or settlements could possibly have a material adverse effect on our finances, we only accrue for losses from litigation and claims if we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
    
  Settlement of NGS Sub Corp., Evolution, et al v. Denbury Onshore, LLC 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we settled the case brought by Evolution Petroleum Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  Evolution ) involving the Delhi Field in northeastern Louisiana, resolving all outstanding disputes and claims the parties had or may have had against each other, including pending litigation claims. 
    
  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, (1) we paid Evolution   $27.5 million   in cash on June 30, 2016; (2) effective July 1, 2016, Denbury conveyed to Evolution   25%   of the interests in the Mengel Sand Interval, a separate interval within the Delhi Unit which we purchased for approximately   $6.5 million   in late 2014, and which interval is not currently producing; (3) effective July 1, 2016, we were credited with an additional   0.2226%   overriding royalty interest in the Holt-Bryant interval (the currently producing interval of the Delhi Unit); (4) the parties reached agreement as to the ownership of certain field assets, and established future CO   2    pipeline transportation charges following the end of the current ten-year fixed price arrangement set to expire in 2019; (5) Evolution waived and released any claims it may have to any insurance proceeds that may be received as a result of existing claims made by Denbury with respect to the June 2013 incident at Delhi Field; and (6) on July 11, 2016, the Court dismissed with prejudice the pending Delhi Field litigation between the parties.  The cash payment was recorded to  Other expenses  in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2016.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included herein and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  Form 10-K ), along with   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   contained in the Form 10-K.  Any terms used but not defined herein have the same meaning given to them in the Form 10-K.  Our discussion and analysis includes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with   Risk Factors   under Item 1A of Part II of this report, along with   Forward-Looking Information   at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than our forward-looking statements. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Denbury is an independent oil and natural gas company with operations focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO   2    enhanced oil recovery operations. 
    
  Oil Price Decline and Impact on Our Business.    Oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results.  Oil prices have historically been volatile, with NYMEX prices ranging from $35 to $111 per Bbl over the last three calendar years, and declining to less than $27 per Bbl in January 2016, the lowest level in over 13 years, and an average of approximately $45 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2016.  The following chart illustrates the fluctuations in our realized oil prices, excluding the impact of commodity derivative settlements, during 2014, 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016. 

Although average second and third quarter oil prices in 2016 have increased from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016, our focus continues to remain on cost reductions and preserving liquidity.  Cost reductions have been realized in all categories of our business in 2016.  We previously set our 2016 capital development budget (excluding capitalized interest) at $200 million, which we expect to be primarily funded with cash flow from operations, thus preserving our liquidity.  One advantage we have in this environment is that our oil assets have relatively low decline rates even with our significantly reduced planned capital spending level, and therefore we anticipate that our average daily production will decline by less than 10% in 2016, excluding the impact of weather-related downtime at Conroe and Thompson fields, completed asset sales, and production shut in for economic reasons.  Lastly, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2017 in order to cover our current level of cash costs

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

and to help mitigate any future price declines or sustained low oil prices (see   Results of Operations   Commodity Derivative Contracts   below). 
    
  During this period of reduced capital spending, we have continued to evaluate our assets with a goal of increasing the value of both existing assets and future projects by optimizing field operational and development plans, reducing CO   2    injection volumes due to increased efficiency, and reducing costs such as power and workovers.  We have reduced our overall CO   2    injection volumes by 35% and our total lease operating expenses by   20%   (23% on a normalized basis   see   Results of Operations   Production Expenses   Lease Operating Expenses  ) when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These initiatives aim to increase the profitability of our assets, making them more resilient to lower oil prices.  Together, we believe these initiatives will help us manage through this low oil price environment. 
    
  2016 Debt Reduction Transactions.    During 2016, we have completed a series of privately negotiated exchange agreements and open-market transactions, contributing to a net reduction of our debt principal balance of approximately $562 million between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  In May 2016, we exchanged   $1,057.8 million   of existing senior subordinated notes with a limited number of holders for   $614.9 million   of our new 9% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Senior Secured Notes ) plus 40.7 million shares of Denbury common stock, resulting in a net reduction from these exchanges of   $442.9 million   in our debt principal.  During the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased   $181.9 million   of our existing senior subordinated notes for   $76.7 million   in open-market transactions, for a net reduction of $105.2 million of our debt principal.  See   Capital Resources and Liquidity   2016 Debt Reduction Transactions   for further discussion. 
    
  2016 Divestiture of Non-Core Assets.    On August 31, 2016, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana (the  Williston Assets ) for $58 million (before closing adjustments).  The sale had an effective date of April 1, 2016, and proceeds realized after closing adjustments totaled $53.6 million.  Approximately $9 million of proceeds from the sale of Williston Assets was paid by the purchaser directly to a qualified intermediary to facilitate a like-kind-exchange, and are therefore not reflected as an investing activity on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  Operating Highlights.    Realized oil prices were relatively consistent on a sequential quarter basis between the second and third quarters of 2016 and only slightly less than the third quarter of 2015.  However, during 2015 and, to a lesser extent, the first half of 2016, we had strong in-the-money hedges offsetting a portion of the effect of low oil prices, collecting   $160.7 million   on these hedges in the third quarter of 2015 and   $52.0 million   during the second quarter of 2016.  Proceeds from hedges settling during the third quarter of 2016 were not as strong, resulting in a $10 per-barrel decrease in our realized oil prices after hedges when compared to those in the second quarter of 2016, and a $29 per-barrel decrease when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  This net realized price decline resulted in lower cash flows during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  In spite of the lower realized oil prices discussed above, our net loss in the third quarter of 2016 decreased due to the substantial decrease in noncash impairments, primarily because the oil price began to stabilize somewhat and the trailing 12-month average price (the primary driver of the value of our proved reserves and therefore any full cost pool ceiling test write-downs) declined only slightly between the second and third quarters of 2016.  The full cost pool ceiling test write-down of our oil and natural gas properties totaled   $75.5 million   (  $48.4 million   net of tax) in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $1.8 billion ($1.1 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2015 (see   Results of Operations       Write-Down of Oil and Natural Gas Properties   below), and during the third quarter of 2015 we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.2 billion net of tax) (see   Results of Operations   2015 Impairment of Goodwill   below).  This significant difference in impairments reduced our net loss during the third quarter of 2016 to $24.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $6.41 per diluted common share, during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  We generated   $96.4 million   of cash flows from operating activities in the   third quarter   of   2016  , an increase of   $35.5 million   from the $60.9 million generated in the   second quarter   of   2016  .  The sequential increase in cash flows from operations was due primarily to positive impacts from working capital changes ($66.9 million) and the second quarter Evolution settlement ($27.5 million), partially offset by a decline in derivative settlements ($59.3 million).  When compared to the prior year third quarter, cash flows from operating activities decreased   $176.3 million   from   $272.7 million  , due primarily to a   $168.0 million   decline in derivative settlements and lower oil prices and production volumes, which caused a decrease in oil revenues, partially offset by reductions in operating expenses.

During the   third quarter   of   2016  , our oil and natural gas production, which was   96%   oil, averaged   61,533   BOE/d, compared to an average of   71,410   BOE/d produced during the   third quarter   of   2015   and   64,506   BOE/d during the   second quarter   of   2016  .  Declines during these comparative periods were significantly impacted by weather-related shut-in production, facility downtime, maintenance and repair work, and natural production declines based on our lower capital spending level, with the year-over-year declines further impacted by production shut in due to economics.  Total production also includes production from the Williston Assets which were sold during the third quarter of 2016 and other property divestitures.  Production related to the Williston Assets and other property divestitures averaged 819 BOE/d in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 1,957 BOE/d during the third quarter of 2015 and 1,530 BOE/d during the second quarter of 2016.  These production decreases were partially offset by increases in production due to continued CO   2    enhanced oil recovery response at Delhi Field in the Gulf Coast region, with the year-over-year decrease further offset by production increases at Bell Creek Field in the Rocky Mountain region.  See   Results of Operations   Production   for further discussion. 
    
  Our average realized oil price per barrel, excluding the impact of commodity derivative contracts, was $  43.45   per Bbl during the   third quarter   of 2016, a   decrease   of   5%   compared to   $45.74   per Bbl realized during the   third quarter   of   2015   and consistent with the average price received during the second quarter of 2016.  The oil price we realized relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential) was $  1.57   per Bbl   below   NYMEX prices in the   third quarter   of   2016  , compared to a   negative     $0.96   per-Bbl NYMEX differential in the   third quarter   of   2015   and a negative   $2.18   per-Bbl NYMEX differential in the   second quarter   of   2016  .  The weakening in our oil price differential in comparison to its level in the   third quarter   of   2015   was principally due to weakening of our Light Louisiana Sweet ( LLS ) premium relative to NYMEX oil prices. 
    
  One of our primary focuses in the past few years has been to reduce costs throughout the organization through a number of internal initiatives.  As a result of these efforts, we have been able to achieve reductions in our lease operating expenses, with total lease operating expenses of   $309.0 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a   20%   reduction when compared to the prior year period (a 23% reduction when normalized to eliminate the effect of special or unusual items in the prior-year period).  Excluding special or unusual amounts reported in 2015, total lease operating expenses per BOE during the nine months ended September 30,   2016   were   $17.32  , compared to   $20.08   during the same prior year period, with decreases realized in most categories of lease operating expenses.  On a sequential-quarter basis, lease operating expenses per BOE increased   10%   from the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to both a 5% decline in production and higher repair costs at Thompson Field attributable to work done to bring the field back to production during the third quarter of 2016.  General and administrative expenses per BOE increased 13% from the second quarter of 2016 due to the decline in production and higher employee-related costs due to our annual long-term incentive grants being made during the third quarter of 2016 rather than in the first quarter as in years past. 
    
  Grieve Field Revised Joint Venture.    On August 4, 2016, the Company and its joint venture partner in Grieve Field, located in Wyoming, reached an agreement to revise the joint venture arrangement between the parties for the continued development of such field.  The revised agreement provides for our partner to fund the remaining estimated capital of $55 million to complete development of the facility and fieldwork in exchange for a 14% higher working interest and a disproportionate sharing of revenue during the first 2 million barrels of production.  As a result of this agreement, our working interest in the field was reduced from 65% to 51%.  This arrangement will accelerate the remaining development of the facility and fieldwork, which we now anticipate should be complete by the middle of 2018. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  Overview.    Our primary sources of capital and liquidity are our cash flows from operations and availability of borrowing capacity under our senior secured bank credit facility.  As a result of the significant reduction in oil prices discussed above and less advantageous hedge positions, our cash flow from operations has significantly decreased, from   $699.4 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $159.4 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The preservation of cash and liquidity remains a significant priority for us in the current oil price environment.  We have taken steps to lower our costs in all categories of our business, and we have made significant progress in that regard.  Over the past year, we have also amended our bank credit facility to relax certain bank covenants through 2018 (see   Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility   below).  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $260.0 million   drawn on our $1.05 billion senior secured bank credit facility, leaving us $714.7 million of current liquidity after consideration of $75.3 million of outstanding letters of credit.  This liquidity, coupled with our other cost saving and liquidity preservation measures, should be sufficient to cover any cash flow shortfall and fund our capital and operating cash outflows during this low oil price environment.

In order to provide a level of price protection to a portion of our oil production, we have entered into a combination of oil swaps, collars, and three-way collars for the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017 (see   Results of Operations   Commodity Derivative Contracts   below).  While a portion of these derivatives entered into in early 2016 are fixed-price swaps at prices that do not support capital spending levels which would grow our production, they do at least cover our most recent total cash costs, which were in a per-barrel range in the low-to-mid $30 s in the third quarter of 2016, including corporate overhead and interest, thereby minimizing the amount that would be required for day-to-day operations from our bank credit facility. 
    
  Since we do not expect oil prices to recover in the foreseeable future to recent historical highs of 2014, we must adjust our business to compete in an oil price environment that is likely not as robust as it was a few years ago, requiring reductions in overall debt levels over time.  We have made significant progress in this endeavor during 2016 with a net reduction in our debt principal of $562 million through September 30, 2016 (see Note 2,   Long-Term Debt  , to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), and we would like to find other ways to reduce our debt.  Our subordinated debt is currently trading higher than it was during the first half of 2016, making it more difficult to make accretive exchanges or repurchases of this debt.  We would like to reduce our debt further if possible, and we plan to monitor the market and be opportunistic in our debt transactions based upon market conditions.  These potential transactions could include purchases of our subordinated debt in the open market, cash tenders for our debt or public or privately-negotiated debt exchanges, and future potential debt reduction with proceeds of issuances of equity, asset sales and other cash-generating activities.  We may utilize a portion of the availability under our bank credit facility for such repurchases and may also consider other forms of capital such as additional second lien notes or other senior notes. 
    
  Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility.    In December 2014, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (the  Bank Credit Agreement ).  In October 2016, as part of our semiannual borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base and lender commitments for our Bank Credit Agreement were reaffirmed at $1.05 billion, with our next borrowing base redetermination scheduled for May 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $260.0 million   of debt outstanding and $75.3 million in letters of credit on the senior secured bank credit facility.  In order to provide more flexibility in managing our balance sheet, the credit extended by our lenders, and continuing compliance with maintenance financial covenants in this low oil price environment, we entered into three amendments to the Bank Credit Agreement between May 2015 and April 2016 that modified the Bank Credit Agreement as follows: 

for 2016 and 2017, the maximum permitted ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated EBITDAX covenant has been suspended and replaced by a maximum permitted ratio of consolidated senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDAX covenant of 3.0 to 1.0 (only debt under our Bank Credit Agreement is considered consolidated senior secured debt for purposes of this ratio); 
                  
    allows for the incurrence of up to $1.0 billion of junior lien debt (subject to customary requirements), with $385.1 million of future incurrence available as of September 30, 2016; 
                
    limits unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to $225 million if more than $250 million of borrowings are outstanding under the Bank Credit Agreement; and 
                
    limits the amount spent on repurchases or other redemptions of our senior subordinated notes to $225 million, with up to $148.3 million of this capacity remaining available as of September 30, 2016. 
       
  For these financial performance covenant calculations as of September 30, 2016, our ratio of consolidated senior secured debt to consolidated EBITDAX was 0.52 to 1.0, our ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest charges was 2.88 to 1.0, and our current ratio was 3.54.  Based upon our currently forecasted levels of production and costs, hedges in place as of November 2, 2016, and current oil commodity futures prices, we currently anticipate continuing to be in compliance with our bank covenants during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. 
    
  The above description of our Bank Credit Agreement financial covenants and the changes provided for within the three amendments are qualified by the express language and defined terms contained in the Bank Credit Agreement, the First Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated May 4, 2015, the Second Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated February 17, 2016,

and the Third Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement dated April 18, 2016, each of which are filed as exhibits to our periodic reports filed with the SEC. 
    
  2016 Debt Reduction Transactions.    During 2016, we have completed a series of privately negotiated debt exchange agreements and open-market debt repurchase transactions, contributing to a net reduction of our debt principal balance of approximately $562 million between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  During May 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements to exchange   $175.1 million   principal amount of our 6 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 ( 2021 Notes ),   $411.0 million   principal amount of our 5 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ), and   $471.7 million   principal amount of our 4 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes ) for   $614.9 million   principal amount of new 2021 Senior Secured Notes plus 40.7 million shares of Denbury common stock, resulting in a net reduction from these exchanges of   $442.9 million   in our debt principal.  Our Bank Credit Agreement allows for the incurrence of up to $1.0 billion of junior lien debt, so after taking these exchanges into account, we have an additional $385.1 million of junior lien debt capacity that remains available to us. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased a total of   $152.3 million   principal amount of our existing senior subordinated notes in open-market transactions, consisting of   $4.0 million   principal amount of our 2021 Notes,   $42.3 million   principal amount of our 2022 Notes, and   $106.0 million   principal amount of our 2023 Notes for a total purchase price of   $55.5 million  , excluding accrued interest.  During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased an additional $29.6 million of senior subordinated notes in open-market transactions, consisting of   $5.8 million   principal amount of our 2021 Notes and   $23.8 million   principal amount of our 2022 Notes for a total purchase price of   $21.2 million  , excluding accrued interest.  The repurchases were made at prices ranging from approximately 25% to 75% of the principal amount of the individual senior subordinated notes.  In connection with these series of transactions, we recognized a $103.1 million gain on debt extinguishment, net of unamortized debt issuance costs written off, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We currently estimate combined annual cash interest savings of approximately $7 million related to these repurchases and the exchange transactions.  Our Bank Credit Agreement limits open-market repurchases of our senior subordinated notes to $225 million, and as of November 2, 2016, we have up to $148.3 million of remaining capacity for senior subordinated notes repurchases or other redemptions. 
    
  Capital Spending  .    We anticipate that our full-year   2016   capital budget, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, will be approximately   $200 million  , which includes approximately   $55 million   in capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs and pre-production tertiary startup costs.  This combined   2016   capital budget amount, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, is comprised of the following: 

$110 million   allocated for tertiary oil field expenditures; 
                
    $30 million   allocated for other areas, primarily non-tertiary oil field expenditures; 
                
    $5 million   to be spent on CO   2    sources and pipeline construction; and 
                
    $55 million   for other capital items such as capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs and pre-production tertiary startup costs. 
       
  Based upon our currently forecasted levels of production and costs, commodity hedges in place, and current oil commodity futures prices, we intend to fund our development capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations, with any potential shortfall funded with incremental borrowings under our senior secured bank credit facility, and as of September 30, 2016, we had ample availability on our senior secured bank credit facility to cover any foreseeable cash flow shortfall.

Capital Expenditure Summary.    The following table reflects incurred capital expenditures (including accrued capital) for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Includes capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs and pre-production tertiary startup costs. 
       
  For the   nine months   ended September 30,   2016  , our capital expenditures and property acquisitions were primarily funded with $159.4 million of cash flows from operations, with additional funds provided by asset sales and borrowings on our senior secured bank credit facility.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our capital expenditures and property acquisitions were fully funded with cash flows from operations. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.    Our off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases for office space and various obligations for development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry, none of which are recorded on our balance sheet.  In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs estimated in our proved reserve reports. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, we amended our CO   2    offtake agreement with Mississippi Power Company ( MSPC ), which amendment included increasing our offtake percentage from 70% to 100% of CO   2    quantities produced and lowering the base price related to the cost of CO   2   , deliveries of which are currently expected to begin in late 2016 or early 2017.  Based on the amended terms in the agreement, we concluded for accounting purposes that the agreement contains an embedded lease related to the pipeline owned by MSPC used to transport CO   2    to Denbury.  We currently plan to record a capital lease on the balance sheet of approximately $110 million upon lease commencement. 
    
  Our commitments and obligations consist of those detailed as of   December 31, 2015  , in our Form 10-K under   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Capital Resources and Liquidity       Commitments and Obligations  . 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Our tertiary operations represent a significant portion of our overall operations and are our primary long-term strategic focus.  The economics of a tertiary field and the related impact on our financial statements differ from a conventional oil and gas play, and we have outlined certain of these differences in our Form 10-K and other public disclosures.  Our focus on these types of operations impacts certain trends in both current and long-term operating results.  Please refer to   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Financial Overview of Tertiary Operations   in our Form 10-K for further information regarding these matters.

              (4) 
    Noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives is a non-GAAP measure and is different from  Commodity derivatives expense (income)  in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in that the noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives represent only the net changes between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions, and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period, which were payments on settlements of   $7.3 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and receipts on settlements of   $117.0 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to receipts on settlements of   $160.7 million   and   $433.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We believe that noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to  Commodity derivatives expense (income)  in order to differentiate noncash fair market value adjustments from receipts or payments upon settlements on commodity derivatives during the periods presented.  This supplemental disclosure is widely used within the industry and by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies in calculating EBITDA and in adjusting net income (loss) to present those measures on a comparative basis across companies, as well as to assess compliance with certain debt covenants.  Noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for  Commodity derivatives expense (income)  in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (5) 
    Lease operating expenses reported in this table include certain special items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, that had the effect of reducing lease operating expenses on a net basis, comprised of (1) lease operating expenses and related insurance recoveries recorded to remediate an area of Delhi Field ($3.2 million) (see   Production Expenses   Lease Operating Expense  ), (2) a reimbursement for a retroactive utility rate adjustment ($9.6 million), and (3) other insurance recoveries ($0.9 million).  If these special items are excluded, lease operating expenses would have increased to $127.6 million and $400.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and lease operating expense per BOE would have increased to an average of $19.43 and $20.08 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Total Production 
    
  Total continuing production during the   third quarter   of   2016   averaged   60,714   BOE/d, including   37,199   Bbls/d from tertiary properties and   23,515   BOE/d from non-tertiary properties.  This total continuing production level represents a   decrease   of   2,262   BOE/d (  4%  ) compared to   second quarter   of 2016 production levels and a decrease of   8,739   BOE/d (  13%  ) compared to   third quarter   of   2015   production levels.  Total continuing production excludes production from the Williston Assets that were sold during the third quarter of 2016 and other minor property divestitures, totaling 819 BOE/d during the third quarter of 2016, compared to 1,530 BOE/d during the second quarter of 2016 and 1,957 BOE/d during the third quarter of 2015.  Third quarter of 2016 production continued to be impacted by the weather-related downtime at Thompson and Conroe fields due to flooding and damage caused by strong thunderstorms in the Houston area during April and May this year; however, both fields were largely returned to full production by the end of September, and combined production from these two fields was relatively flat sequentially.  Most of the sequential quarterly production decline was related to our tertiary production, which was impacted to some degree by unplanned downtime at some fields and a planned facility turnaround at Tinsley Field.  This production decline was offset in part by continued tertiary production growth at Delhi Field. 
    
  In reviewing the   13%   decline in continuing production from the third quarter of 2015, approximately one-half of the production decline was due to weather-related shut-in production at Thompson and Conroe fields, planned facility downtime at Tinsley Field and unplanned downtime at other fields.  The remaining decline is largely due to natural production declines; although we have some inclining production at our fields, we are not currently investing sufficient capital to hold production flat. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we estimate that approximately 2,000 BOE/d of production remained shut in attributable to uneconomic wells, a reduction of approximately 600 BOE/d from June 30, 2016 levels, primarily due to the Williston Asset sale, in addition to minor production volumes returned to production during the quarter.  Our production during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   96%   oil, consistent with 95% oil production during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Tertiary Production 
    
  Oil production from our tertiary operations during the   third quarter   of   2016     decreased     2,013   Bbls/d (  5%  ) sequentially and   3,635   Bbls/d (  9%  ) compared to the same period in   2015  .  These decreases were primarily due to facility downtime at Tinsley Field, unplanned compressor downtime at Oyster Bayou Field, and natural production declines at our mature fields in the Gulf Coast region, partially offset by increased production due to continued CO   2    enhanced oil recovery response at Delhi Field in the Gulf Coast region. The year-over-year decline was further offset by increased production at Bell Creek Field in the Rocky Mountain region. 
    
  Non-Tertiary Production 
    
  Continuing production from our non-tertiary operations averaged   23,515   BOE/d during the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   249   BOE/d (  1%  ) sequentially and   a decrease   of   5,104   BOE/d (  18%  ) compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   levels.  The year-over-year production declines include weather-related downtime at Conroe and Thompson fields, as noted above, and production attributable to wells shut in as uneconomic to either produce or repair due to commodity prices.  When combined, these weather-related downtime and shut-in production impacts resulted in a quarterly production decline of approximately 3,000 BOE/d when compared to prior year.  In addition, the sequential and year-over-year changes include natural production declines at our non-tertiary properties in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions.

Oil and Natural Gas Revenues 
    
  Our oil and natural gas revenues during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     17%   and   29%  , respectively, compared to these revenues for the same periods in   2015  .  The changes in our oil and natural gas revenues are due to changes in production quantities and commodity prices (excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts), as reflected in the following table: 

Excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts, our net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during the first quarters, second quarters, third quarters, and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

As reflected in the table above, our average net realized oil price, excluding the impact of commodity derivative contracts,   decreased     5%   during the   third quarter   of   2016   from the average price received during the   third quarter   of   2015   and was consistent with the average price received during the second quarter of 2016.  Company-wide average oil price differentials in the   third quarter   of   2016   were   $1.57   per Bbl   below   NYMEX, compared to an average differential of   $0.96   per Bbl   below   NYMEX in the   third quarter   of   2015   and $2.18 per Bbl below NYMEX in the second quarter of 2016.  The change versus prior year was principally due to weakening of our Gulf Coast region LLS price differentials, offset in part by Rocky Mountain region price differentials described below.  Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality, and location differentials.  The oil differentials we received in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions are discussed in further detail below. 
    
  Our average NYMEX oil differential in the Gulf Coast region was a   negative     $0.77   per Bbl and a positive   $0.92   per Bbl during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a   negative     $1.22   per Bbl during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  These differentials are impacted significantly by the changes in prices received for our crude oil sold under LLS index prices relative to the change in NYMEX prices, as well as various other price adjustments such as those noted above.  The quarterly average LLS-to-NYMEX differential (on a trade-month basis) was a positive $1.73 per Bbl in the   third quarter   of   2016  , down from a positive $3.89 per Bbl in the   third quarter   of   2015   and down from a positive $2.04 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2016.  During the third quarter of 2016, we sold approximately   60%   of our crude oil at prices based on, or partially tied to, the

LLS index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. 
    
  NYMEX oil differentials in the Rocky Mountain region averaged   $3.08   per Bbl and   $4.73   per Bbl below NYMEX during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3.98   per Bbl below NYMEX during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  Differentials in the Rocky Mountain region can fluctuate significantly on a month-to-month basis due to weather, refinery or transportation issues, and Canadian and U.S. crude oil price index volatility.

In order to provide a level of price protection to a portion of our oil production, we have entered into a combination of oil swaps, collars, and three-way collars for the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017.  The following table summarizes our commodity derivative contracts as of November 2, 2016: 

(1) 
    Averages are volume weighted. 
              (2) 
    If oil prices were to average less than the sold put price, receipts on settlement would be limited to the difference between the floor price and the sold put price. 
       
  Based on current futures prices as of November 2, 2016, which average approximately $46 per Bbl for the remainder of 2016, and the fixed-price swaps that we have in place, we currently expect that we will make cash payments for the remainder of the year upon settlement of these contracts, the amount of which is dependent upon fluctuations in future NYMEX prices in relation to the fixed prices of these swaps, which have a weighted average price of $38.80 per Bbl for the remainder of 2016.  Changes in commodity prices, expiration of contracts, and new commodity contracts entered into cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts.  Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the period-to-period changes in the fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized in our statements of operations.  The details of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts at   September 30, 2016  , are included in   Note 5  ,   Commodity Derivative Contracts  , to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Also, see Item 3,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   below for additional discussion on our commodity derivative contracts.

Production Expenses 
    
  Lease Operating Expense 

Our lease operating costs on an absolute-dollar basis have declined as a result of our cost reduction efforts, as well as general market decreases in the prices of many of the components of these costs.  When normalized to exclude a reimbursement for a retroactive utility rate adjustment ($9.6 million) and an insurance reimbursement ($4.1 million) in the 2015 periods, t  otal lease operating expenses decreased     $21.1 million     (  17%  ) and     $91.9 million     (  23%  ) on an absolute-dollar basis during the     three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,     compared to levels in the same periods in 2015.  These reductions were   due to cost decreases in most lease operating expense categories, the most significant of which included     (1) a decrease in workover costs and repairs as a result of reduced failures through root-cause analysis and fewer well repairs in the nine-month period as more wells are uneconomic to repair based on low commodity prices, (2) lower power costs due to lower usage and rates, (3) lower CO   2    expense resulting from a decrease in CO   2    injection volumes, and (4) lower company labor costs resulting from a reduction in force.  The reductions were partially offset by increased repair costs at Thompson Field following the weather-related events of the second quarter of 2016.  On a per-BOE basis, our total normalized lease operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparative periods in 2015.  However, those decreases on a percentage basis were not as large as the absolute-dollar decrease, as our lower production between the periods offset some of the cost reductions.  Adjusting for the weather-related impacts at Thompson Field, lease operating expenses per BOE would have been $18.23 and $17.12 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
    
  Sequentially, lease operating expenses increased 7% on an absolute-dollar basis and 10% on a per-BOE basis between the second and third quarters of 2016.  The increase on an absolute-dollar basis was primarily due to increased repair costs at Thompson Field following the weather-related events of the second quarter of 2016.  The sequential quarter increase on a per-BOE basis was further impacted by the decrease in production. 
    
  Currently, our CO   2    expense comprises approximately 20% of our typical tertiary lease operating expenses, and for the CO   2    reserves we already own, consists of CO   2    production expenses, and for the CO   2    reserves we do not own, consists of our purchase of CO   2    from royalty and working interest owners and industrial sources.  During the   third quarter  s of   2016   and   2015  , approximately 57% of the CO   2    utilized in our CO   2    floods consisted of CO   2    owned and produced by us (our net revenue interest).  The price we pay others for CO   2    varies by source and is generally indexed to oil prices.  When combining the production cost of the CO   2    we own with what we pay third parties for CO   2   , our average cost of CO   2    during the   third quarter   of   2016   was approximately $0.35 per Mcf, including taxes paid on CO   2    production but excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization of capital expended at our CO   2    source fields and industrial sources.  This per-Mcf CO   2    cost during the   third quarter   of   2016   was higher than the $0.31 per Mcf during the   third quarter   of   2015   due primarily to a lower utilization of CO   2,    while certain pipeline and processing costs

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

are relatively fixed, but lower than the $0.38 per Mcf comparable measure during the second quarter of 2016 due to higher relative CO   2    volumes in the Gulf Coast region at a lower cost.  Including the cost of depletion, depreciation and amortization of capital expended at our CO   2    source fields and industrial sources, but excluding depreciation of our CO   2    pipelines, our cost of CO   2    was $0.47 per Mcf and $0.42 per Mcf during the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase between periods is primarily the result of the significant reduction of CO   2    production volumes, while certain of our depreciation costs remain fixed.  As we anticipate additional industrial-sourced CO   2    volumes from MSPC coming into our CO   2    supply in late 2016 or early 2017, we expect that our per-Mcf cost of CO   2    could trend higher; however, utilizing industrial-sourced CO   2    significantly reduces the future capital we would otherwise have to spend at Jackson Dome and provides a long-term consistent source of CO   2   . 
    
  Marketing and Plant Operating Expenses 
    
  Marketing and plant operating expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred relating to the marketing, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas production, as well as expenses related to our Riley Ridge gas processing facility.  Marketing and plant operating expenses were   $14.5 million   for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and   $40.6 million   and   $40.4 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Taxes Other Than Income 
    
  Taxes other than income includes ad valorem, production and franchise taxes.  Taxes other than income   decreased     $5.2 million   (  20%  ) and   $25.8 million   (  30%  ) during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  , due primarily to a decrease in production taxes resulting from lower oil and natural gas revenues and a decrease in the assessed value of our properties resulting in lower ad valorem taxes during 2016. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses ( G A ) 

Gross cash compensation and administrative costs on an absolute-dollar basis   decreased     $17.3 million   (  22%  ) and   $55.5 million   (  22%  ) during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to those costs in the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to lower employee-related costs such as salaries, bonus accruals and long-term incentives.  As part of our efforts to reduce overhead and operating costs in response to the significant decline in oil prices, we reduced our employee headcount in mid-2015 and further reduced our employee headcount in February 2016 through an involuntary workforce reduction, which contributed to an overall headcount reduction of approximately 30% between March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  The severance-related payments associated with the 2016 workforce reduction were approximately $9.3 million.  The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was offset in part by higher severance costs incurred during the first quarter of 2016 compared to severance costs in 2015.

Net G A expense on a per-BOE basis   decreased     13%   and   23%   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to levels in the same periods in 2015.  The changes were primarily based upon the changes noted in gross cash compensation and administrative costs, partially offset by lower operating and overhead recovery charges, lower capitalized exploration and development costs, and lower production volumes. 
    
  Gross stock-based compensation on an absolute-dollar basis   decreased     $2.6 million   (  27%  ) and   $15.2 million   (  52%  ) during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to levels in the same periods in   2015  .  The decrease during both periods was primarily due to the reductions in headcount mentioned above, the reduction in previously-recognized stock compensation expense associated with our performance share awards for our executive officers which vested in the first quarter of 2016 or are projected to vest in future periods below target levels, and the postponement of our annual long-term incentive award grants from January in prior years to early July in the current-year period. 
    
  Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well.  In addition, salaries associated with field personnel are initially recorded as gross cash compensation and administrative costs and subsequently reclassified to lease operating expenses or capitalized to field development costs to the extent those individuals are dedicated to oil and gas production, exploration, and development activities. 
    
  Interest and Financing Expenses 

(1) 
    Cash interest is presented on an accrual basis, and includes interest on our new 2021 Senior Secured Notes (interest on which is to be paid semiannually May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2016), which are accounted for as debt and not reflected as interest for financial reporting purposes.  See below for further discussion. 
              (2) 
    Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discount or premium. 
       
  As reflected in the table above, cash interest during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , decreased when compared to the same periods in 2015 due primarily to repurchasing a total of $181.9 million principal amount of our existing senior subordinated notes at a discount to par value in open-market transactions during the first nine months of 2016.  In addition, we entered into privately negotiated exchange transactions during the second quarter of 2016 to exchange $1,057.8 million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes for $614.9 million principal amount of our new 2021 Senior Secured Notes plus 40.7 million shares of Denbury common stock (see   Capital Resources and Liquidity   2016 Debt Reduction Transactions  ).  Although these exchange transactions had minimal impact on our cash interest, as more fully described in Note 2,   Long-Term Debt  , to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the exchange transactions were accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification 470-60,   Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors  , whereby $254.7 million of future interest on the 2021 Senior Secured Notes has been recorded as debt, which will be reduced as semiannual interest payments are made, with the remaining $22.8 million of future interest to be recognized as interest expense over the term of the 2021 Senior Secured Notes.  Therefore, future interest expense reflected in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations on the 2021 Senior Secured Notes will be significantly lower than the actual cash interest payment.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, $12.5 million of interest on the 2021 Senior Secured Notes was accounted for as debt, and is therefore not reflected as interest expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Noncash interest expense during

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased when compared to the same prior year period due to the $5.5 million write-off of debt issuance costs associated with our senior secured bank credit facility following the May 2016 redetermination which reduced our borrowing base and lender commitments and the February 2016 amendment which reduced our lender commitments.  Capitalized interest during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased     $1.2 million   (  15%  ) and   $6.3 million   (  25%  ), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to a reduction in the number of projects that qualify for interest capitalization. 
    
  Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization ( DD A ) 

We adjust our DD A rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs.  In addition, under full cost accounting rules, the divestiture of oil and gas properties generally does not result in gain or loss recognition; instead, the proceeds of the disposition reduce the full cost pool.  As such, our DD A rate has changed significantly over time, and it may continue to change in the future.  DD A of oil and natural gas properties and asset retirement obligations   decreased     68%   and   63%   on an absolute-dollar basis during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  On a per-BOE basis, DD A of oil and natural gas properties and asset retirement obligations decreased   63%   and   59%   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  These decreases were primarily due to a reduction in depletable costs associated with our reserves base resulting from the significant full cost pool ceiling test write-downs recognized during 2015 and the first half of 2016 and an overall reduction in future development costs, partially offset by reductions in proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities.  The per-BOE decrease was also partially offset by a decrease in production volumes during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the 2015 period.  Given the additional full cost pool ceiling test write-down recognized during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we currently expect our DD A rate in the fourth quarter of   2016   to decrease slightly from the   third quarter   of   2016   rate.  However, the overall decrease in our fourth quarter DD A rate will also be impacted by potential changes in reserve volumes, production, and future capital expenditure estimates, among other factors, and therefore, the actual decrease may differ from this estimate. 
    
  Depletion and depreciation of our CO   2    properties, pipelines, plants and other property and equipment   decreased     11%   on an absolute-dollar basis and increased   3%   on a per-BOE basis during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease on an absolute-dollar basis between periods was primarily due to lower depletion associated with our CO   2    properties resulting from a decrease in CO   2    production during the period, while the increase on a per-BOE basis was primarily driven by the decrease in oil and natural gas production volumes between the third quarter of 2015 and 2016.

Write-Down of Oil and Natural Gas Properties    
    
  Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation.  Under these rules, the full cost ceiling value is calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period ended as of each quarterly reporting period.  The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves has followed a precipitous and continuing decline in oil prices throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, and the average has declined from   $59.21   per Bbl for the third quarter of 2015 to   $41.68   per Bbl for the   third quarter   of   2016  .  In addition, the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX natural gas price used in estimating our proved reserves was   $3.04   per MMBtu for the third quarter of 2015 and   $2.36   per MMBtu for the   third quarter   of   2016  .  These third quarter prices represent a decrease of 17% for crude oil and 10% for natural gas prices compared to prices used to calculate the December 31, 2015, full cost ceiling value.  These falling prices have led to our recognizing full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of   $75.5 million  , $479.4 million, and $256.0 million during the three months ended September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and   $1.8 billion  , $1.7 billion, and $146.2 million during the three months ended September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2015, respectively.  We currently do not expect that we will record a significant write-down in the fourth quarter of 2016 if oil and natural gas prices remain at or near late-October 2016 levels.  Any such write-down would also be affected, in part, by changes in proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, future capital expenditures and operating costs. 
    
  2015 Impairment of Goodwill 
    
  We are required to test goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2015, to fully impair the carrying value of our goodwill. 
    
  Other Expenses 
    
  Other expenses totaled   $36.2 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily comprised of a   $27.5 million   cash payment to Evolution pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into in June 2016.  See Note 7,   Commitments and Contingencies  , to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  
    
  Income Taxes 

We evaluate our estimated annual effective income tax rate based on current and forecasted business results and enacted tax laws on a quarterly basis and apply this tax rate to our ordinary income or loss to calculate our estimated tax liability or benefit.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $34.5 million   of deferred tax assets associated with State of Louisiana net operating losses.  As the result of a new tax law enacted in the State of Louisiana effective June 30, 2015, which limits a company s utilization of certain deductions, including our net operating loss carryforwards, we recognized tax valuation allowances of $30.5 million during the second quarter of 2015, $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, and an additional   $0.9 million   during the first quarter of 2016, which reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets associated with State of Louisiana net operating losses.  The valuation allowances will remain until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an unrecognized tax benefit of $5.4 million related to an uncertain tax position.  The unrecognized tax benefit was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a direct reduction of the associated deferred tax asset and, if recognized, would not materially affect our annual effective tax rate.  The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position will  

37 

Table of Contents  
  Denbury Resources Inc. 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position.  We currently do not expect a material change to the uncertain tax position within the next 12 months.  Our policy is to recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense; however, no such amounts were accrued related to the uncertain tax position as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Our income taxes are based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38% in   2016   and   2015  .  Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was slightly lower than our estimated statutory rate, primarily due to the full cost pool ceiling test write-downs recorded.  The nine-month period was further impacted by the impact of a tax shortfall on the stock-based compensation deduction (e.g., the compensation expense recognized in the financial statements was greater than the actual compensation realized resulting in a shortfall in the income tax deduction for stock awards that vested during the first quarter) which, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, was recorded as an adjustment to equity.  Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was lower than our estimated statutory rate, as a significant portion of the book value of our goodwill impaired during the third quarter of 2015 had no related tax basis.  Therefore, no corresponding deferred tax benefit was recognized related to that portion of the goodwill impairment.  Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was further impacted by the tax valuation allowance discussed above, which also reduced the net deferred tax benefit recognized.  The deferred income tax benefits during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, were primarily due to the impact of the write-down of our oil and natural gas properties during the year.  In connection with the privately negotiated exchange agreements to exchange a portion of our existing senior subordinated notes for 2021 Senior Secured Notes during the second quarter of 2016, we realized a tax gain due to the concession extended by our note holders.  This tax gain was offset by net operating losses and other deferred tax asset attributes. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an estimated $51.1 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward related to our tertiary operations, $21.6 million of research and development credits, and $41.1 million of alternative minimum tax credits that can be utilized to reduce our current income taxes during   2016   or future years.  The enhanced oil recovery credits and research and development credits do not begin to expire until 2023 and 2031, respectively.  We currently do not expect to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits during 2016.

  Debt and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
    
  We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt.  These debt agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $260.0 million   of debt outstanding on our senior secured bank credit facility.  At this level of variable-rate debt, an increase or decrease of 10% in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our interest expense.  None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, although under the NEJD financing lease, in light of recent credit downgrades in February 2016, we were required to provide a $41.3 million letter of credit to the lessor, which we provided on March 4, 2016.  The letter of credit may be drawn upon in the event Denbury Onshore or Denbury fail to make a payment due under the pipeline financing lease agreement or upon other specified defaults set out in the pipeline financing lease agreement (filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 5, 2008).  The fair values of our senior secured second lien notes and senior subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices.  The following table presents the principal cash flows and fair values of our outstanding debt at   September 30, 2016  : 

See   Note 2  ,   Long-Term Debt  , to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our long-term debt. 
    
  Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts 
    
  Historically, we have entered into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  Generally, these contracts have consisted of various combinations of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, and fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put.  The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt, financial strength, and expectation of future commodity prices.  In order to provide a level of price protection to a portion of our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2017 using both NYMEX and LLS fixed-price swaps, collars and three-way collars.  See also   Note 5  ,   Commodity Derivative Contracts  , and   Note 6  ,   Fair Value Measurements  ,   to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts. 
    
  All of the mark-to-market valuations used for our commodity derivatives are provided by external sources.  We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification.  All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our senior secured bank credit facility (or affiliates of such lenders).  We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our commodity derivative contracts, which we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads. 
    
  For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our commodity derivative contracts.  This means that any changes in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings.

At   September 30, 2016  , our commodity derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of $73.9 million, a $28.5 million   decrease   from the $102.4 million net liability recorded at June 30, 2016, and a $216.7 million decrease from the $142.8 million net asset recorded at December 31, 2015.  Changes in this value are comprised of the expiration of commodity derivative contracts during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , new commodity derivative contracts entered into during 2016 for future periods, and to the changes in oil futures prices between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis 
    
  Based on NYMEX and LLS crude oil futures prices as of   September 30, 2016  , and assuming both a 10% increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make payments on our crude oil derivative contracts as shown in the following table: 

Our commodity derivative contracts are used as an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future production.  As a result, changes in receipts or payments of our commodity derivative contracts due to changes in commodity prices as reflected in the above table would be mostly offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the cash receipts on sales of our oil and natural gas production to which those commodity derivative contracts relate.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.      As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  , to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that information that is required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have determined that, during the   third quarter   of fiscal   2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses.  While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business or finances, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties.  Although a single or multiple adverse rulings or settlements could possibly have a material adverse effect on our business or finances, we only accrue for losses from litigation and claims if we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
    
  Potential Mississippi Environmental Administrative Proceeding 
    
  The Company is currently attempting to conclude negotiations with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality ( MDEQ ) that began following receipt of a February 2015 notice from the MDEQ related to a discharge of materials at the West Heidelberg Field in Jasper County, Mississippi in the third quarter of 2013.  Based upon discussions with the MDEQ during 2016, it is currently anticipated that a settlement related to the discharge providing for a monetary fine as a civil penalty will be reached with the MDEQ in 2016, thus eliminating the need for an administrative proceeding.  The Company expects any such fine will not be material to the Company s business or financial condition. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Information with respect to the Company s risk factors has been incorporated by reference to Item 1A of the Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in the Form 10-K since its filing.

  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The following table summarizes purchases of our common stock during the   third quarter   of   2016  : 

(1) 
    Stock repurchases during the   third quarter   of   2016   were made in connection with delivery by our employees of shares to us to satisfy their tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of restricted shares and the exercise of stock appreciation rights. 
       
           (2) 
    In October 2011, we commenced a common share repurchase program, which has been approved for up to an aggregate of $1.162 billion of Denbury common shares by the Company s Board of Directors.  The program has no pre-established ending date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  We are not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of our common stock under the program, and do not anticipate repurchasing shares of our common stock as long as current commodity pricing and market conditions persist. 
       
  Between early October 2011 and   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   64.4 million   shares of Denbury common stock (approximately   16.0%   of our outstanding shares of common stock at September 30, 2011) for   $951.8 million  , with no repurchases made since October 2015.
