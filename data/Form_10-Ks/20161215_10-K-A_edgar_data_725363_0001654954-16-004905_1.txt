on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report; 

3.           Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial

respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
this report; 

4.           The
registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

a)           designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure

ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared; 

b)           designed

accepted accounting principles; 

c)           evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and

performing the equivalent functions): 

a)           all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and 

b)           any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have significant role in the registrant s

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and 

b)           any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have significant role in the registrant s
