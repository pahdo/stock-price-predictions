        1. B  asis of Presentation   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of R.R. Donnelley   Sons Company and its subsidiaries (the  Company  or  RR Donnelley ) and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include estimates and assumptions of management that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 Spinoff Transactions  
 On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced separation of its financial communications and data services business ( Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.  or  Donnelley Financial ) and the publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business ( LSC Communications, Inc.  or  LSC ) into two separate publicly-traded companies (the "Separation"). The Company completed the tax free distribution of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of Donnelley Financial and 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of LSC, to the Company s stockholders (the  Distribution ). The Distribution was made to the Company s stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016, who received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock and one share of LSC common stock for every eight shares of RR Donnelley common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the Distribution, Donnelley Financial and LSC are now independent public companies trading under the symbols  DFIN  and  LKSD , respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange. Immediately following the Distribution, the Company held 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial Solutions common stock and 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock. The Company will account for these investments as available-for-sale equity securities. The value of the Company s investment in Donnelley Financial and LSC was approximately $350.1 million, calculated using the mid-point stock price for each company s common stock on October 3, 2016. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the historical results of Donnelley Financial and LSC, as the Separation did not take place until October 1, 2016. In future filings, the historical results of Donnelley Financial and LSC will be presented as discontinued operations. As a result of the Separation, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not indicative of the Company's future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 In conjunction with the Separation, the Company entered into certain agreements with Donnelley Financial and LSC, to implement the legal and structural separation from Donnelley Financial and LSC, govern the relationship between the Company, Donnelley Financial and LSC up to and after the completion of the Separation, and allocate between the Company, Donnelley Financial and LSC various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, intellectual property and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, Patent Assignment and License Agreement, Trademark Assignment and License Agreement, Data Assignment and License Agreement, Software, Copyright and Trade Secret Assignment and License Agreement, Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement and commercial and other arrangements and agreements. 
 Reverse Stock Split  
 Immediately following the Distribution on October 1, 2016, the Company effected a one for three reverse stock split for RR Donnelley common stock (the  Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company s Board of Directors on September 14, 2016 and previously approved by the Company s stockholders at the annual meeting on May 19, 2016. 
   As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding and treasury shares of the Company s common stock will be reduced proportionally based on the Reverse Stock Split ratio of one share for every three shares of common stock held before the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares of RR Donnelley common stock were distributed to stockholders in connection

  with the Reverse Stock Split, but in  stead, all fractional shares were aggregated by the Company s transfer agent and sold at the prevailing price in the open-market on October 6, 2016. The total number of aggregated shares of the Company s common stock of   3,088   shares was sold for total net   cash proceeds of   less than   $0.  1   million which was then paid to s  tock  holders in an amount equal to their respective pro rata share of the total net cash proceeds.   All references in these   unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements   to the n  umber of shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.      
   
 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 2016 Acquisitions 
 On August 4, 2016, the Company acquired Precision Dialogue Holdings, LLC ( Precision Dialogue ), a provider of email marketing, direct mail marketing and other services with operations in the United States for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of approximately $58.6 million. The acquisition expanded the Company s ability to help its customers measure communications effectiveness and audience engagement.   Precision Dialogue contributed $8.2 million in sales and a loss before income taxes of $1.1 million during the  three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and is  included within the operating results of the Variable Print segment.  
 The Precision Dialogue acquisition was recorded by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired, including other intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  The excess of the cost over the net amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill associated with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisition. The total tax deductible goodwill related to the Precision Dialogue acquisition was $8.8 million. 
 Based on the valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Precision Dialogue acquisition was as follows:

 (in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise indicated)  
   
    The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is still in the process of obtaining data to finalize the estimated fair values of certain   intangible assets  .  
 The fair values of other intangible assets, technology and goodwill associated with the Precision Dialogue acquisition were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.  The following table presents the fair value, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs for these Level 3 measurements: 

The fair values of property, plant and equipment associated with the 2016 acquisitions were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy and were estimated using either the market approach, if a secondhand market existed, or the cost approach.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0.7 million and $2.7 million of acquisition-related expenses, respectively, associated with completed or contemplated acquisitions within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 2016 Dispositions 
 On January 11, 2016, the Company sold two entities within the business process outsourcing reporting unit for net proceeds of $13.4 million, all of which was received as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company sold three immaterial entities for proceeds of $0.3 million. The dispositions of these entities resulted in a loss of $0.3 million and a net gain of $12.0 million during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which were recorded in other operating income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operations of these entities were included in the International segment. 
   
 2015 Acquisitions 
 On June 8, 2015, the Company acquired Courier Corporation ( Courier ), a leader in digital printing and publishing primarily in the United States, specializing in educational, religious and trade books. The acquisition expanded the Company s digital printing and content management capabilities. The purchase price for Courier was $137.3 million in cash and 2.7 million shares of RR Donnelley common stock, or a total transaction value of $291.5 million based on the Company s closing share price on June 5, 2015, plus the assumption of Courier s debt of $78.2 million. Courier had $20.9 million of cash as of the date of acquisition. Immediately following the acquisition, the Company repaid substantially all of the debt assumed. Courier s book manufacturing operations are included in the Publishing and Retail Services segment, publishing operations are included in the Strategic Services segment and Brazilian operations are included in the International segment. 
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $0.3 million and $14.1 million of acquisition-related expenses, respectively, associated with acquisitions completed or contemplated, within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The Courier acquisition was recorded by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired, including other intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  The excess of the cost over the net amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill associated with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisition.

    In addition to the acquisition of Courier, the Company completed three insignificant   acquisitions in 2015, one of which included the settlement of accounts receivable in exchange for the acquisition of the business.  
 The tax deductible goodwill related to 2015 acquisitions was $15.0 million. 
 Based on the valuations, the final purchase price allocation for the 2015 acquisitions was as follows: 

The fair values of other intangible assets, technology and goodwill associated with the acquisition of Courier were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.  The following table presents the fair value, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs for these Level 3 measurements: 

The fair values of property, plant and equipment associated with the Courier acquisition were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy and were estimated using either the market approach, if a secondhand market existed, or the cost approach.  
 2015 Disposition 
 On April 29, 2015, the Company sold its 50.1% interest in its Venezuelan operating entity. The proceeds were de minimis, and the sale resulted in a  net loss of $14.7 million, which was recognized in net investment and other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company s Venezuelan operations had net sales of $16.3 million and a loss before income taxes of $38.4 million, including the net loss as a result of the sale, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

    Restructuring and   Impairment Charges  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $11.2 million and $24.9 million, respectively, for employee termination costs for an aggregate of 870 employees, of whom 843 were terminated as of September 30, 2016. These charges primarily related to the reorganization of certain administrative functions and operations, two facility closures in the International segment and one facility closure in the Publishing and Retail Services segment. Additionally, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $2.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company also recorded $0.5 million of net impairment charges primarily related to buildings and machinery and equipment associated with facility closures, as well as gains on the sale of previously impaired assets. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $18.8 million and $39.8 million, respectively, for employee termination costs for 1,829 employees, all of whom were terminated as of September 30, 2016. These charges primarily related to two facility closures, both in the International segment, one facility closure in the Variable Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations. Additionally, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $4.6 million and $13.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recorded $7.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively, of net impairment charges primarily related to buildings and machinery and equipment associated with facility closures. The fair values of the buildings and machinery and equipment were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy and were estimated based on discussions with real estate brokers, review of comparable properties, if available, discussions with machinery and equipment brokers, dealer quotes and internal expertise related to the current marketplace conditions.   
   
  As the result of the Company s interim goodwill impairment review, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $13.7 million and $4.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 to recognize the impairment of goodwill in the Europe and Latin America reporting units, respectively, both of which are within the International segment. The goodwill impairment charge in the Europe reporting unit was due to the announced reorganization of certain operations which resulted in a reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit based on lower expectations of future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations as of the October 31, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test. As of September 30, 2015, the Europe and Latin America reporting units had no remaining goodwill. The goodwill impairment charges were determined using Level 3 inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses, comparable marketplace fair value data and management s assumptions in valuing the significant tangible and intangible assets. Additionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $2.3 million for the impairment of intangible assets, substantially all of which related to the impairment of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and trade names in the Latin America reporting unit within the International segment.  
 Other Charges 
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded other charges of $1.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for multi-employer withdrawal pension plan obligations unrelated to facility closures. The total liabilities for the withdrawal obligations associated with the Company s decision to withdraw from multi-employer pension plans included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities are $11.0 million and $78.4 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 .    
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded other charges of $1.3 million and $23.1 million, respectively, including integration charges of $19.1 million for payments made to certain Courier employees upon the termination of Courier s executive severance plan, immediately prior to the acquisition.  
 The Company s multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities could be affected by the financial stability of other employers participating in the plans and any decisions by those employers to withdraw from the plans in the future. While it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of future events or circumstances, reductions in other employers  participation in multi-employer pension plans, including certain plans from which the Company has previously withdrawn, could have a material impact on the Company s previously estimated withdrawal liabilities, consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
  As a result of the acquisition of Courier, the Company participates in two multi-employer pension plans, in one of which the Company's contributions account for approximately 85% of the total plan contributions.  Both plans are estimated to be underfunded and   have a Pension Protection Act zone status of critical ( red ). Red status identifies plans that are less than 65% funded.

    Restructuring Reserve   
 The restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as follows: 

The current portion of restructuring reserves of $22.9 million at September 30, 2016 was included in accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion of $33.5 million, primarily related to multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations related to facility closures and lease termination costs, was included in other noncurrent liabilities at September 30, 2016. 
 The Company anticipates that payments associated with the employee terminations reflected in the above table will be substantially completed by September 2017.  
 Payments on all of the Company s multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations are scheduled to be completed by 2034. Changes based on uncertainties in these estimated withdrawal obligations could affect the ultimate charges related to multi-employer pension plan withdrawals.  
 The restructuring liabilities classified as  lease terminations and other  consisted of lease terminations and other facility closing costs. Payments on certain of the lease obligations are scheduled to continue until 2026. Market conditions and the Company s ability to sublease these properties could affect the ultimate charges related to the lease obligations. Any potential recoveries or additional charges could affect amounts reported in the Company s financial statements. 

7. Employee Benefits  
 The components of the estimated net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense (income) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

    In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company communicated to certain former employees the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity with payments   computed in accordance with statutory requirements, beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Payments to eligible participants who elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity were funded from existing pension plan assets and constituted a comp  lete settlement of the Company s pension liabilities with respect to these participants. The Company s pension assets and liabilities were remeasured as of the payout date. The discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate the payouts were det  ermined in accordance with federal regulations. As of the remeasurement date, the reduction in the reported pension obligation for these participants was $354.8 million, compared to payout amounts of approximately $328.4 million  . The Company recorded non-c  ash settlement charges of   $1.6 million and $98.5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,     in connection with the settlement payments. These charges resulted from the re  cognition in earnings of a portion of the actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss based on the proportion of the obligation settled.  
 During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed the method used to estimate the interest cost components of net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Historically, the interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these interest components of net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement and calculation of the Company s total benefit obligations. The Company has accounted for this change prospectively as a change in estimate. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company announced the discontinuation of retiree medical, prescription drug and life insurance benefits for individuals retiring on or after October 1, 2016. This change was accounted for as a significant plan amendment and the other postemployment benefit plan obligations were remeasured as of September 30, 2016. This remeasurement resulted in a reduction to the other postemployment benefit plan obligations of $35.0 million and a curtailment gain of $16.4 million within cost of sales and $3.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

8. Equity  
 The Company s equity as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as follows:  

On May 31, 2016, the Company reduced the par value of the authorized shares of RR Donnelley s common stock from $1.25 per share to $0.01 per share.

    The Company s equity as of December 31, 2014 and   September 30, 2015  , and changes during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , were as follows:   

During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company issued stock in conjunction with the Courier acquisition with a closing date value of $154.2 million.   

9. Earnings per Share  
 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to RR Donnelley common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In computing diluted earnings per share, basic earnings per share is adjusted for the assumed issuance of all potentially dilutive share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. Performance share units are considered anti-dilutive and excluded if the performance targets upon which the issuance of the shares is contingent have not been achieved and the respective performance period has not been completed as of the end of the current period. Additionally, stock options are considered anti-dilutive when the exercise price exceeds the average of the Company s stock price during the applicable period.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no shares of common stock were purchased by the Company; however, shares were withheld for tax liabilities upon the vesting of equity awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 2.7 million shares of stock in conjunction with the Courier acquisition.

    The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation and the anti-dilutive sh  are-based awards for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was as follows:   

(1)   
 
  Earnings per share amounts, dividends declared per common share and adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding for all periods reflect RR Donnelley's 1-for-3 reverse stock split, which was effective October 1, 2016.     

10. Comprehensive Income

12. Commitments and Contingencies  
 The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change and are generally not discounted. The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party or has received claims in thirteen active federal and state Superfund and other multiparty remediation sites. In addition to these sites, the Company may also have the obligation to remediate eleven other previously and currently owned facilities. At the Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act provides that the Company s liability could be joint and several, meaning that the Company could be required to pay an amount in excess of its proportionate share of the remediation costs.     
 The Company s understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the multiparty sites and of other liable parties at the previously owned facilities has been considered, where appropriate, in the determination of the Company s estimated liability. The Company established reserves, recorded in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, that it believes are adequate to cover its share of the potential costs of remediation at each of the multiparty sites and the previously and currently owned facilities. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
 From time to time, the Company s customers and others file voluntary petitions for reorganization under United States bankruptcy laws. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company from these parties could be considered preference items and subject to return. In addition, the Company may be party to certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the final resolution of these preference items and litigation will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

    13  . Debt   
 The Company s debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

(b)   
 
 Includes miscellaneous debt obligations and capital leases. The balance as of December 31, 2015 also included the fair value adjustments to the 8.25% senior notes due March 15, 2019 related to the Company s fair value hedges, which were terminated as of September 30, 2016.     

The fair values of the senior notes and debentures, which were determined using the market approach based upon interest rates available to the Company for borrowings with similar terms and maturities, were determined to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company s debt was greater than its book value by approximately $120.9 million at September 30, 2016 and less than its book value by approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2015.  
 In connection with the spin-off transactions, on September 30, 2016, Donnelley Financial issued 8.250% senior notes due 2024 with an aggregate principal of $300.0 million (the  DFS Notes ) and incurred a senior secured term loan B facility (the  DFS Term Loan Facility ) under its new credit agreement in an aggregate principal of $350.0 million, under which Donnelley Financial will borrow at 4.00% over LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. Donnelley Financial s credit agreement also includes a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which was undrawn as of September 30, 2016. Additionally on September 30, 2016, LSC issued 8.750% senior secured notes due 2023 with an aggregate principal of $450.0 million (the  LSC Notes ) and incurred a senior secured term loan B facility (the  LSC Term Loan Facility ) under its new credit agreement in an aggregate principal of $375.0 million, under which LSC will borrow at 6.00% over LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. LSC s credit agreement also includes a $400.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which was undrawn as of September 30, 2016. The net proceeds from the sale of the LSC Notes and the borrowings under the DFS Term Loan Facility and the LSC Term Loan Facility were distributed to their parent company, RR Donnelley in connection with the spinoff transactions. RR Donnelley used these proceeds to reduce its existing debt. Additionally, t here were approximately $4.5 million of accrued financing fees as of  September 30, 2016 related to these transactions.

    On August 31, 2016, the Company and   certain third party financial institutions   (such financial institutions collectively, the  Third Party Purchasers ), launched cash tender offers for certain of the Company s outstanding deb  t securities, including the Company s 6.125  % senior n  otes due   January 15,   2017   (the  2017 Notes )  , 7.250  % senior n  otes due   May 15,   2018   the ( 2018 Notes )  , 8.250  % senior n  otes due   March 15, 2019   (the  2019 Notes )   and 7.000%   senior n  otes due   February 15,   2022   (the  2022 Notes )  . On September 16, 2016, the Third Party Purchasers purchased $  27  4.  4   million in aggregate principal amount of   the   2017 Notes and 2018 Notes   (the  Third Party Purchase Notes ). On September 30, 2016, the Company purchased approximatel  y $503.6 million in aggregate principal amount of   the   2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes, the 2019 Notes and the 2022 Notes   (the  Company Purchase Notes ), and exchanged $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of   the DFS Notes   for the Third Party Purchase Not  es. The Company cancelled the Third Party Purchase Notes and Company Purch  ase Notes on September 30, 2016. As a result, the Company recognized an $  83.9   million loss on debt extinguishment  s   in the three months ended September 30, 2016   related to premiums an  d other related transaction costs  .   
  On October 6, 2016, the Company redeemed the outstanding $45.8 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes and the outstanding $21.3 principal amount of the 2019 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, the Company redeemed the outstanding $155.2 million aggregate principal of the 2017 Notes on November 2, 2016. As a result, the Company expects to recognize an estimated $9.0 million loss on debt extinguishments in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) providing for $800.0 million in credit facilities (the  Revolving Facility ). The Revolving Facility matures on September 30, 2021. Interest rates on borrowings are equal to, at the Company s option, a base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.50%, or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.125% to 2.50%, in either case based upon the leverage ratio of RR Donnelley. In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee on the actual daily amount of the aggregate revolving commitments regardless of usage ranging from 0.375% to 0.50%, based upon the leverage ratio of the Company. As a result of the reduction in borrowing capacity, the Company recognized a $1.4 million loss related to   unamortized debt issuance costs   within loss on debt extinguishments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company had approximately $0.8 million of accrued financing fees as of   September 30, 2016   related to this transaction.   
  The Credit Agreement   contains a number of restrictive covenants, including a maximum secured leverage ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the   Credit Agreement  , that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of $60.0 million in aggregate though additional dividends may be permitted subject to certain conditions.  
 The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the prior Credit Agreement was 2.2% and 2.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Interest income was $1.3 million and $4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to pay the $219.8 million of 8.6% senior notes that matured on August 15, 2016.

    1  4  . Derivatives   
 All derivatives are recorded as other current or noncurrent assets or other current or noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values. Unrealized gains and losses related to derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes, or in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss related to the derivatives are generally recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the transaction affects earnings. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for designation as a hedge at inception, or fail to meet the criteria thereafter, are recognized currently in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. At the inception of a hedge transaction, the Company formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge. In addition, the Company assesses both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative in the hedging transaction has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and whether the derivative is expected to continue to be highly effective. The impact of any ineffectiveness is also recognized currently in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in many countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues, expenses or other transactions are not in the local currency of the subsidiary or operating unit, the Company is exposed to currency risk. Periodically, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations. Accordingly, the gains and losses associated with the fair values of foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized currently in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables, receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The aggregate notional value of the forward contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $260.4 million and $268.4 million, respectively. The fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts were determined to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy and are valued using market exchange rates.  
 On March 13, 2012, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively changing the interest rate on $400.0 million of its fixed-rate senior notes to a floating-rate based on LIBOR plus a basis point spread. The interest rate swaps, with a notional value of $400.0 million at inception, were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the value of the Company s $450.0 million 8.25% senior notes due March 15, 2019, which were attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.  During 2014, the Company repurchased $211.1 million of the 8.25% senior notes due March 15, 2019, and related interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $210.0 million were terminated, resulting in payments of $4.2 million for the fair value of the interest rate swaps.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the tender of the Company s 8.25% senior notes due March 15, 2019, the Company terminated the remaining $190.0 million notional value of the interest rate swap agreements which resulted in cash received of $2.5 million for the fair value of the interest rate swaps.   
 The fair values of interest rate swaps were determined to be Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy and were developed using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on the expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves. In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit enhancements to the contracts, are incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the credit value adjustments of the interest rate swap agreements, which take into account the possibility of counterparty and the Company s own default.  
 The Company s foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps are subject to enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions with the respective counterparties. The Company settles foreign exchange forward contracts on a net basis when possible. Foreign exchange forward contracts that can be settled on a net basis are presented net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest rate swaps are settled on a gross basis and presented gross in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

    The Company manages credit risk for its derivative positions on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis, considering the net port  folio exposure with each counterparty, consistent with its risk management strategy for such transactions. The Company s agreements with each of its counterparties contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligat  ions if it either defaults or, in certain cases, is capable of being declared in default of any of its indebtedness greater than specified thresholds. These agreements also contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default subsequent to a   merger or restructuring type event if the creditworthiness of the resulting entity is materially weaker.   
 At September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the total fair value of the Company s foreign exchange forward contracts, which were the only derivatives not designated as hedges, and fair value hedges, along with the accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in which the fair value amounts were included, were as follows:  

The pre-tax (gains) losses related to derivatives not designated as hedges recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the pre-tax (gains) losses related to the hedged items attributable to changes in the hedged benchmark interest rate and the offsetting (gain) loss on the related interest rate swaps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:    

The Company also recognized a net reduction to interest expense of $0.2 million and $1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.5 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, related to the Company s fair value hedges, which included interest accruals on the derivatives and amortization of the basis in the hedged items.

    1  5  . Venezuela Currency Remeasurement   
 As described in Note 2,  Acquisitions and Dispositions ,  on April 29, 2015 the Company sold its 50.1% interest in its Venezuelan operating entity.  
 Since January 1, 2010, the three-year cumulative inflation for Venezuela using the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index has exceeded 100%. As a result, Venezuela s economy is considered highly inflationary and the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries were remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S. Dollar. Prior to March 31, 2014, the financial statements were remeasured based on the official rate determined by the government of Venezuela.   
 During the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan government expanded the operation of the Supplementary System for the Administration of Foreign Currency ( SICAD 1 ) currency exchange mechanism for use with certain transactions. In addition, the Venezuelan government also began operating the SICAD 2 exchange which the government indicated was available to all entities for all transactions.  The Venezuelan government indicated that the official rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar would be reserved only for settlement of U.S. Dollar denominated purchases of  essential goods and services.  As of December 31, 2014, the SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 exchange rates were 12.0 and 50.0 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, respectively. Beginning March 31, 2014, certain assets of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries were remeasured at the SICAD 2 rate as the Company believed those assets would ultimately be utilized to settle U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities using SICAD 2.  Remaining net monetary assets were remeasured at the SICAD 1 rate, as the Company believed SICAD 1 would be applicable for future transactions, and dividend remittances, if any, from the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries.  During the three months ended June 30, 2014, certain transactions pending approval at the official rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar were approved, resulting in foreign exchange gains.    
 In February 2015, the Venezuelan government discontinued the SICAD 2 rate and introduced a new currency exchange rate mechanism ( SIMADI ).  As of February 28, 2015, monetary assets and liabilities of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries were remeasured at the SIMADI rate as the Company believed the SIMADI was the exchange rate mechanism most likely to be available to the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries to settle U.S. Dollar denominated transactions. As of March 31, 2015, the SIMADI rate was 193 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar. 
   As a result of the remeasurement at the SIMADI rate and the related impact of the devaluation, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a pre-tax loss of $30.3 million ($27.5 million after-tax) was recognized in net investment and other expense, of which $10.5 million was included in loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.  

16. New Accounting Pronouncements  
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued  Accounting Standards Update No.  2016-02  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires lessees to put most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expense on the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, ASU 2016-02 also modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective in the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted; however the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue using a five-step process that supersedes virtually all existing revenue guidance. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,  which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to January 1, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2014-09 is permitted in the first quarter of 2017; however the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The standard allows the option of either a full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or a modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and currently anticipates applying the modified retrospective approach when adopting the standard.

I  tem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
 Company Overview  
 R.R. Donnelley   Sons Company ( RR Donnelley,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our ), a Delaware corporation, helps organizations communicate more effectively by working to create, manage, produce, distribute and process content on behalf of our customers. The Company assists customers in developing and executing multichannel communication strategies that engage audiences, reduce costs, drive revenues and increase compliance. R.R. Donnelley s innovative technologies enhance digital and print communications to deliver integrated messages across multiple media to highly targeted audiences at optimal times for clients in virtually every private and public sector. Strategically located operations provide local service and responsiveness while leveraging the economic, geographic and technological advantages of a global organization.  
 Spinoff Transactions  
 On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced separation of its financial communications and data services business ( Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.  or  Donnelley Financial ) and the publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business ( LSC Communications, Inc.  or  LSC ) into two separate publicly-traded companies (the "Separation"). The Company completed the tax free distribution of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of Donnelley Financial and 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of LSC, to the Company s stockholders (the  Distribution ). The Distribution was made to the Company s stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016, who received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock and one share of LSC common stock for every eight shares of RR Donnelley common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the Distribution, Donnelley Financial and LSC are now independent public companies trading under the symbols  DFIN  and  LKSD , respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange. Immediately following the Distribution, the Company held 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial Solutions common stock and 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock. The Company will account for these investments as available-for-sale equity securities. The value of the Company s investments in Donnelley Financial and LSC was approximately $350.1 million, calculated using the mid-point stock price for each company s common stock on October 3, 2016. 
 The disclosures within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   are on a consolidated Company basis which includes the results of Donnelley Financial and LSC and do not take into account the Separation. In future filings, the historical results of Donnelley Financial and LSC will be presented as discontinued operations. As a result of the Separation, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not indicative of the Company's future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 1A,  Risk Factors , of Part I of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016 and Item 1A of Part II under  Risk Factors  below for certain risk factors relating to the Separation.    
 Reverse Stock Split  
 Immediately following the Distribution on October 1, 2016, the Company effected a one for three reverse stock split for RR Donnelley common stock (the  Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company s Board of Directors on September 14, 2016 and previously approved by the Company s stockholders at the annual meeting on May 19, 2016. 
 As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of issued and outstanding and treasury shares of the Company s common stock will be reduced proportionally based on the Reverse Stock Split ratio of one share for every three shares of common stock held before the Reverse Stock Split. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Presentation , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split.  All references in these  unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements  to the number of shares of common stock and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

 Executive Overview 
 Third Quarter Overview  
   Net sales decreased by $55.6 million,   or 2.0%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. There was a $22.2 million, or 0.8%, decrease due to foreign exchange rates. In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, the decrease  
   
 32 

in net sales was due to lower volume in the Publishing and Retail Services, Variable Print and International segments, price pressu  res, a decrease in fuel surcharges in the logi  stics reporting unit   within the Strategic Services segment   and a $4.  4   million decline in pass-through paper sales. These items were partially offset by increased volume in the Strategic Services segment.  
 The Company continues to take actions across all segments to reduce its cost structure and enhance productivity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company realized cost savings from restructuring activities including the reorganization of administrative and support functions across all segments and facility consolidations. Additional cost savings were realized as a result of synergies from the integration of Courier.   
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.8 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $204.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected the  timing of supplier and customer payments, higher spinoff-related transaction expenses and higher payments for taxes, partially offset by lower payments for incentive compensation .  
 In connection with the spinoff transactions, the Company incurred spinoff-related transaction expenses of $27.0 million and $57.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Company expects to incur approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million of additional spinoff-related transaction and transition expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016, including advisory and other expenses. 
 As a result of the spin-off transactions of Donnelley Financial and LSC on October 1, 2016,  the Company is re-evaluating the realizability of its domestic deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2016.

 Operations:  reflected price pressures, unfavorable mix in the Strategic Services segment, lower volume in the Publishing and Retail Services and Variable Print segments, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense and cost saving initiatives. See further details in the review of operating results by segment that follows below.

 OUTLOOK  
 Competitive Environment  
 Technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and Internet technologies, continue to impact the market for the Company s products and services. One of the Company s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products and services, including print, which provide differentiated solutions for its customers. The Company works with its customers to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multi-channel communications strategies. The Company has and will continue to develop and expand its creative and design, content management, digital and print production, supply chain management and distribution services to address its customers  evolving needs while supporting the strategic objective of becoming a leading global provider of integrated communication services. 
 The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive. Despite consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented. Across the Company s range of products and services, competition is based primarily on price in addition to quality and the ability to service the special needs of customers. Management expects that prices for the Company s products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years. Therefore, the Company believes it needs to continue to lower its cost structure and continue to differentiate its product and service offerings. 
 Digital technologies have impacted printed retail inserts, magazines and catalogs as some advertiser spending has moved from print to electronic media. Electronic communication and transaction technology has eliminated or reduced the role of many traditional printed products and has continued to drive electronic substitution in directory and statement printing, in part driven by environmental concerns and cost pressures at key customers. In recent years, the trend in e-book substitution has shifted and the publishing industry has experienced growth in consumer print book volume, while sales of e-books have declined. The future impact of technology on the Company s business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments to offer customers innovative services and solutions that further secure the Company s position as a technology leader in the industry.    
   The acquisition of Courier supports the Company s strategic objective of generating profitable growth and improved cash flow and liquidity through targeted acquisitions. The acquisition has enhanced the Company s existing capabilities and ability to serve its  
   
 36 

customers and h  as provided cost savings through the combination of best practices, complementary products and manufacturing and distribution capabilities.   
 The Company has implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities. Future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities. Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial.  Management also reviews the Company s operations and management structure on a regular basis to balance appropriate risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support the Company s long-term strategic goals. Additionally, to align with its long-term strategic goals, the Company split into three independent public companies effective October 1, 2016.  The spinoff transactions will allow each business to pursue their own strategies and invest according to the unique dynamics of their respective industries. Refer to  Spinoff Transactions  for further details regarding the spinoff transactions.  
 Seasonality  
 Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by the Company. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books is higher in the second half of the year driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, and holiday volume in catalogs, retail inserts and books. Partially offsetting this pattern, demand for financial print and related services is typically stronger in the first half of the year due to annual compliance requirements. Additionally, the Company s Commercial and Digital Print reporting unit produces campaign-related printed products. Therefore, quarterly and annual results may be impacted by U.S. election cycles. These seasonal patterns can also be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy. The Company expects the seasonality impact in 2016 and future years to be in line with historical patterns. However, due to the breadth of our products and services offerings, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality in our business. 
 Raw Materials  
 The primary raw materials the Company uses in its print businesses are paper and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. In addition, a substantial amount of paper used by the Company is supplied directly by customers. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades and ink formulations used in the manufacturing process may affect the Company s consolidated financial results. Paper prices fluctuated during the first nine months of 2016, and volatility in the future is expected. Generally, customers directly absorb the impact of changing prices on customer-supplied paper. With respect to paper purchased by the Company, the Company has historically passed most changes in price through to its customers. Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support the Company s continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable the Company to successfully do so. Management believes that the paper industry is consolidating, and there may be shortfalls in the future in supplies necessary to meet the demands of the entire marketplace. Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on customers  demand for printed products. The Company has undertaken various strategic initiatives to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to the Company s ink requirements. The Company also resells waste paper and other print-related by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products. 
 The Company continues to monitor the impact of changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs, which impact the Company s ink suppliers, logistics operations and manufacturing costs. Crude oil and energy prices continue to be volatile. The Company believes its logistics operations will continue to be able to pass a substantial portion of any increases in fuel prices directly to its customers in order to offset the impact of related cost increases. Decreases in fuel prices are also passed on to customers which negatively impacts sales. The Company generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on its manufacturing costs, however, the Company enters into fixed price contracts for a portion of its natural gas purchases to mitigate the impact of changes in energy prices. The Company cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the Company s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 Distribution  
 The Company s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S. or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically  or by direct shipment to customer facilities. Through its logistics operations, the Company manages the distribution of most customer products printed by the Company in the U.S. and Canada to maximize efficiency and reduce costs for customers.  
   As a leading provider of print logistics and among the largest mailers of standard mail in the U.S., the Company works closely with its customers and the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) to offer innovative products and mail preparation services to

minimize postage costs. While the Company does not directly absorb the impact of higher postal rates on its customers  mailings, demand   for products distributed through the U.S. or foreign postal services has been negatively impacted by increases in postal rates  ,   as postal costs are a significant component of many customers  cost structures. Under the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhance  ment Act, it had been anticipated that postage for its Market Dominant mail categories would increase annually by an amount equal to or slightly less than the Consumer Price Index (the  CPI ). On January 15, 2015, the USPS filed for a CPI rate increase of   approximately 2.0%, which was approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission (the  PRC ) on May 7, 2015, and became effective on May 31, 2015.  On April 10, 2016, the USPS removed the exigent surcharge, which was approved in December 2013, resulting in a 4.3  % decrease in postage rates for all significant mail categories. The USPS has announced that it will seek a CPI postage increase on January 22, 2017 of approximately 1.0%. In addition, there is a pending bi-partisan legislative proposal that seeks to stabi  lize the financial condition of the USPS, which among other things calls for restoring a 2.15% increase (approximately half   of the exigent surcharge) on market d  ominant mail categories. Congressional passage of this legislation is unlikely in 2016.     The USP  S has temporarily suspended its previously announced plans to restructure its mail delivery network, including the closure of many post office facilities. These restructuring plans may resume in 2017. The impact to the Company of the USPS s restructuring p  lans, many of which require legislative action, cannot currently be estimated. Mail delivery services through the USPS accounted for approximately 41% of the Company s logistics revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
 The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of its interim review for indicators of impairment, management analyzed potential changes in value of individual reporting units with goodwill based on each reporting unit s operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to expected results. In addition, management considered how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last fiscal year s impairment analysis, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events.  
 Management considered trends in these factors when performing its assessment of whether an interim impairment review was required for any reporting unit. Based on this interim assessment, management concluded that as of September 30, 2016, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying value. Nevertheless, significant changes in economic and market conditions could result in changes to expectations of future financial results and key valuation assumptions. Such changes could result in revisions of management s estimates of the fair value of the Company s reporting units and could result in a material impairment of goodwill in a future interim period or as of October 31, 2016, the Company s next annual measurement date.  
 In particular, the commercial and digital print, statement printing and digital and creative solutions reporting units have experienced declines in sales primarily due to decreased volume. Continued  negative trends could impact the estimated fair values of these reporting units and could result in future impairment charges.  As of the October 31, 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, the fair values of the  commercial and digital print,  statement printing and  digital and creative solutions  reporting units exceeded their respective book values by approximately 20%, 17% and 27%. As of September 30, 2016, $416.3 million, $126.9 million and $25.5 million of goodwill was allocated to the  commercial and digital print, statement printing and digital and creative solutions  reporting units, respectively.   The commercial and digital print and statement printing  reporting units are part of the Variable Print segment. The  digital and creative solutions reporting unit is part of the Strategic Services segment. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
 The funded status of the Company s pension and other postretirement benefits plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. Market conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates (used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans) and the market value of the securities held by the plans, which could significantly increase or decrease the funded status of the plans. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December 31. Based on current estimates, the Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $25.0 million to $30.0 million to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans for the full year 2016, of which $18.6 million has been contributed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company announced the discontinuation of retiree medical, prescription drug and life insurance benefits for individuals retiring on or after October 1, 2016. This change was accounted for as a significant plan amendment and the other postemployment benefit plan obligation was remeasured as of September 30, 2016. This remeasurement resulted in a reduction to the other postemployment benefit plan obligations of $35.0 million and a curtailment gain of $16.4 million within cost of sales and $3.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 38 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company communicated to retirees the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity with payments beginning in the second quarter of 2016.   A p  ortion of the eligible participants elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity and as a result the Company s pension assets and liabilities were remeasured as of the payout date. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a non-ca  sh settlement charge of   $1.6 million and   $98.5 million in selling, general and ad  ministrative expenses during   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   (see Note 7,   Employee Benefits  , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  
 During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed the method used to estimate the interest cost components of net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Historically, the interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these interest components of net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement and calculation of the Company s total benefit obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in estimate, which prospectively started in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in the interest cost components of net pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense for 2016 associated with this change in estimate is approximately $34.0 million.    
 Financial Review  
 In the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and certain other information and does not give effect to the spinoff transactions which occurred on October 1, 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.

 Strategic Services segment income from operations decreased $11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, mainly due to a reduction in publishing volume and capital markets transactions and compliance products activity, partially offset by volume increases in freight brokerage services and sourcing, a purchase accounting inventory adjustment in the prior year period and lower restructuring, impairment and other charges. Operating margins decreased from 8.1% to 6.2% due to lower book publishing volume, a reduction in capital market transactions activity and unfavorable revenue mix in the logistics reporting unit. A purchase accounting inventory adjustment in the prior year period and lower restructuring, impairment and other charges improved operating margins by 0.2 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points, respectively. 
   
 44 

International   

Net sales in the International segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $539.5 million, a decrease of $32.1 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2015, including a $21.0 million, or 3.7%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The net sales decrease was also due to lower volume in the business process outsourcing, Global Turnkey Solutions, Europe and Latin America reporting units, as well as price pressures. An analysis of net sales by reporting unit follows:  

Asia: Sales increased due to higher volume primarily in packaging, partially offset by lower volume in labels along with price pressures.      

Business process outsourcing: Sales decreased due to changes in foreign exchanges rates, lower volume as a result of the sale of two entities in the first quarter of 2016 and price pressures.     

Global Turnkey Solutions: Sales decreased primarily due to lower volume.      

Europe: Sales decreased primarily due to lower volume and changes in foreign exchange rates.     

Canada: Sales increased due to higher volume in statement printing, forms and labels.     

Latin America: Sales decreased primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates across the region and lower volume.

 Depreciation and amortization decreased $29.0 million to $312.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower capital spending in recent years compared to historical levels, partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization due to the acquisition of Courier. Depreciation and amortization included $49.6 million and $58.6 million of amortization of other intangible assets related to customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, licenses and agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other operating income was $12.0   million, which rel  ated to   the   net   gain on the sale of entities in the International segment.  
 Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $343.1 million, a decrease of $53.5 million, or 13.5%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to the impact of the non-cash pension settlement charge, higher spinoff-related transaction expenses, price pressures, unfavorable revenue mix in the Strategic Services segment, lower volume in the Variable Print segment and increased bad debt and legal expenses, partially offset by the acquisition of Courier, including synergies from the integration, lower restructuring, impairment and other charges, lower depreciation and amortization expense and the curtailment gain.   

Net interest expense decreased $3.1 million to $204.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in average senior notes outstanding, partially offset by higher average borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  
 Net investment and other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.4 million and $43.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a loss of $30.3 million related to the currency remeasurement in Venezuela and the related impact of the devaluation, a $14.7 million net loss on the sale of its Venezuelan operating entity and a loss of $2.8 million for the impairment of the Company s investment in the Brazilian operations of Courier. 
 Loss on debt extinguishments, related to premiums paid, unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $85.3 million due to the tender of senior notes and amendments to the Credit Agreement.  

The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 64.4% compared to 54.1% in the same period in 2015.  The income tax provision for the period ended September 30, 2016   reflects the impact of certain non-deductible spinoff-related transaction expenses, income taxes for certain internal reorganization transactions in preparation for the spinoff transactions within the International segment and the adjustment of valuation allowances in the International segment.    The income tax provision for the period ended September 30, 2015  reflects charges for unrecognized tax positions of $9.0 million due to the receipt of an unfavorable court decision relating to payment of prior year taxes in the International segment, a lower tax benefit than the statutory rate of the Venezuelan currency devaluation, the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and the loss on the sale of the Company's Venezuelan operating entity.     
 Income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $0.8 million and a loss of $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the remeasurement of the Venezuelan currency, net of foreign exchange gains, resulted in losses attributable to noncontrolling interests of $10.5 million.  
 Net earnings attributable to RR Donnelley common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $80.1 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition to the factors described above, the per share results reflect an increase in weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.0 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Courier.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its stockholders. Operating cash flows and the Company s $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) are the Company s primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company s long-term debt obligations, distributions to stockholders that may be approved by the Board of Directors, acquisitions, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth and completion of restructuring programs. All references to the Credit Agreement and other credit facilities are related to RR Donnelley, unless otherwise specified as being borrowing by Donnelley Financial or LSC.

 LIQUIDITY  
 Cash and cash equivalents of $411.8 million as of September 30, 2016 included $94.3 million in the U.S. and $317.5 million at international locations. The Company s foreign subsidiaries are expected to make approximately $175.0 million in payments in 2016 and future years in satisfaction of intercompany obligations. The Company has recognized deferred tax liabilities of $5.5 million as of September 30, 2016 related to local taxes on certain foreign earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. Certain other cash balances of foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. or local country taxes if repatriated to the U.S. In addition, repatriation of some foreign cash balances is further restricted by local laws. Management regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws, or the Company s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.  
 Included in cash and cash equivalents of $411.8 million at September 30, 2016 were $27.7 million of short-term investments, which primarily consisted of short-term deposits and money market funds. These investments are held at institutions with sound credit ratings and are expected to be highly liquid.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a base or Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin determined at the time of the borrowing. In addition, the Company pays facility commitment fees which fluctuate dependent on the Credit Agreement s leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement is used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and letters of credit.

 There were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016. Based on the Company s results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and existing borrowings, the Company would have had the ability to utilize approximately $742.9 million of the $800.0 million Credit Agreement and not have been in violation of the terms of the agreement.  
   
 55 

The current availability under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016 is shown in the table below:   

The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2016, and expects to remain in compliance based on management s estimates of operating and financial results for 2016 and the foreseeable future. However, declines in market and economic conditions or demand for certain of the Company s products and services could impact the Company s ability to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in future periods. As of September 30, 2016, the Company met all the conditions required to borrow under the Credit Agreement and management expects the Company to continue to meet the applicable borrowing conditions.  
 The failure of a financial institution supporting the Credit Agreement would reduce the size of the Company s committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. Currently, the Credit Agreement is supported by sixteen U.S. and international financial institutions.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $83.0 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, of which $57.1 million were issued under the Credit Agreement.  The letters of credit used under the Credit Agreement reduced availability under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company also had $159.4 million in other uncommitted credit facilities, primarily outside the U.S. (the  Other Facilities ).

Total borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Other Facilities (the  Combined Facilities ) were $8.0 million as of September 30, 2016. 
 The Company s liquidity may be affected by its credit ratings. On September 14, 2016, Moody s Investor Services ( Moody s ) downgraded the Company s long-term corporate credit rating from Ba3 to B1 and changed the credit ratings outlook from developing to stable.  Moody s also downgraded its rating on the Company s senior unsecured debt and Credit Agreement from B1 to B2 and Baa3 to Ba1, respectively.

RR Donnelley has no obligations under Donnelley Financial s or LSC s senior secured notes or credit agreements. 
 There were no debt issuances during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    
 MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable debt and price risk on its fixed-rate debt. At September 30, 2016, the Company s variable-interest borrowings were $30.0 million, or approximately 0.8%, of the Company s total debt under borrowings under the Combined Facilities. Approximately 99% of the Company s outstanding term debt was comprised of fixed-rate debt as of September 30, 2016.  
 The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates. Using this sensitivity analysis, such changes would not have a material effect on interest income or expense and cash flows and would change the fair values of fixed-rate debt at September 30, 2016 and 2015 by approximately $102.0 million and $101.8 million, respectively.  
 The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in many countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate. To the extent that borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues, expenses or other transactions are not in the local currency of the subsidiary, the Company is exposed to currency risk and may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was approximately $260.4 million and $268.4 million, respectively (see Note 14,  Derivatives , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Net unrealized losses from these foreign exchange forward contracts were $1.8 million at September 30, 2016 and net unrealized gains from these foreign exchange forward contracts were $0.3 million at December 31, 2015. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that had materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II  OTHER INFORMATION  
   
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
 For a discussion of certain litigation involving the Company, see Note 12,  Commitments and Contingencies,  to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   
     Item 1A. Risk Factors  
   The following risk factors amend and supplement the Risk Factors identified under Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with such risk factors in the Form 10-K.  Unless the context otherwise  
   
 59 

requires, the risk factors identified below relating to the Company relate to the Company after giving effect to the completion of the spinoff transactions.    
 The spinoffs may not achieve the intended results. 
 The Company s operational and financial profile changed upon the separation of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions from the Company s other businesses. As a result, the Company s diversification of revenue sources diminished, and the Company s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of our business in the multichannel communications management industry. Further, shares of the Company s common stock represent an investment in a smaller company. These changes may not meet some stockholders  investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their shares of the Company s common stock. Excessive selling could cause the relative market price of the Company s common stock to decrease.   
 Further, the anticipated benefits to the Company of the spinoff transactions were based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. Any such incorrect assumptions could adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 In addition, we believe that the spinoff transactions will result in a number of benefits to the Company, including, among others, enabling management to better focus on our multichannel integrated communications business.  However, if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction, or if those benefits are delayed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and the value of our stock could be adversely impacted 
 The price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate significantly with the completion of the spinoffs. 
 We cannot predict the prices at which the Company s common stock may trade now that the spinoffs are complete , the effect of the spinoffs on the trading prices of the Company s common stock or whether the market value of the Company s common stock and the common stock of each of the new public companies held by a stockholder after the spinoffs will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of the Company s common stock held by such stockholder prior to the spinoffs. 
   The Company may not realize the full benefits from its retained ownership interests in LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions .   
 As part of the spinoff transactions, the Company distributed approximately 80.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions to the Company s stockholders.  After giving effect to these distributions, the Company retained approximately 19.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of each of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions.  In connection with the spinoff transactions, the Company entered into a stockholder and registration rights agreement with each of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions governing the Company s ownership and potential disposition of the shares of common stock retained in each company. The Company will dispose of any shares of common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions that it retains within the 12-month period following the initial distribution of shares of common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions to the Company s stockholders. 
 As with any investment in a publicly traded company, the Company s retained ownership in each company is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the businesses of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions and risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in public equity markets generally.  In addition, under the stockholders  and registration rights agreement, the Company gave a proxy to each company to vote all of its retained shares of common stock in proportion to the votes cast by LSC Communications  and Donnelley Financial Solutions  other stockholders. Consequently, the Company does not retain any influence over the management and affairs of each of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions. 
 Pursuant to the stockholders  and registration rights agreement with each company, we may dispose of shares of common stock of either company to investment banks in exchange for our outstanding public debt. We will dispose of all of the shares of common stock we retain in LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions within a year of the spinoff distribution date. Any disposition of shares of common stock of LSC Communications or Donnelley Financial Solutions held by the Company in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for LSC Communications common stock and Donnelley Financial Solutions common stock and thereby adversely affect the value of our retained ownership interests or adversely affect the terms and conditions of such disposition.  
   
 60 

Post-spin, we are a smaller company and may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in purchasing power.   
 Prior to the completion of the spinoff transactions, we had been able to take advantage of our size and purchasing power in sourcing products and services from third-party vendors. Since the spinoff transactions are complete, we are a smaller company and may not have the same purchasing power that we had before the completion of the spinoff transactions. Although we are seeking to expand our direct purchasing relationships with many of our most important third-party vendors, we may be unable to obtain products and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to completion of the spinoff transactions, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flow. 
   The Company may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management, which may be exacerbated by the spinoff transactions.  
 The Company s success depends, in part, on its general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of the Company s employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on the Company. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. Many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than the Company offers. In addition, many members of the Company s management have significant industry experience that is valuable to the Company s competitors. The Company enters into non-solicitation and, as appropriate, non-competition agreements with its executive officers, prohibiting them contractually from soliciting the Company s customers and employees and from leaving and joining a competitor within a specified period.  
 Furthermore, as a result of the spinoff transactions, certain members of our senior management team prior to the spinoff, resigned from their roles with the Company to assume positions with either LSC Communications or Donnelley Financial Solutions. The loss of members of our senior management team and other key employees due to the spinoff transactions may result in transitional challenges or temporary difficulty in managing our business properly, which could harm business prospects and the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    
 The spinoff transactions could result in significant tax liability.  
 We obtained an opinion from our outside legal counsel substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distributions in connection with the spinoff transactions will qualify as tax-free distributions under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). The opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Additionally, we have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that certain limited aspects of the distributions will not prevent the distributions from satisfying certain requirements for tax-free treatment under the Code. The opinion and the private letter ruling rely on customary factual representations and assumptions, which if incorrect or inaccurate may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion and letter ruling.  
 If either or both of the distributions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the common stock of such spun-off entity in a taxable sale for its fair value. In that case, it is expected that RR Donnelley stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of the spun-off entity s common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each holder s tax basis in its Company common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to RR Donnelley stockholders and us would be substantial if this were to occur. 
 Global market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on customers  businesses, could adversely affect the Company.  
 Global economic conditions affect customers  businesses and the markets they serve. In general, demand for the Company s products and services are highly correlated with general economic conditions. Because a significant part of the Company s business relies on its customers  advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and consumer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for printing and related services that the Company provides to these customers. Delays or reductions in customers  spending would have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could be material, and consequently could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased revenue, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. In addition, customer difficulties could result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. The Company may experience operating margin declines as a result.  Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for the Company to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments.  
   
 61 

Such declines in demand are difficult to predict and may result i  n the Company or the industry having increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for the Company s products and services. The overall business climate may also be impacted by wars or acts of terror  ism. Such acts may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for the Company s products and services.   
 Further, in June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 
   Our business is dependent upon brand reputation and the quality of our customer support and services offerings and if we fail to offer effective customer support and services, our brand reputation would be harmed and customers may not use our solutions, resulting in a decline of our net sales.  
 A high level of customer support and service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions and the maintenance and enhancement of our brand reputation. If we are unable to provide a level of customer support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience a loss of customers and market share and a decline in our brand reputation which may result in reduced customer demand for our solutions. Furthermore, our brand reputation could be impacted by a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including actions of our competitors and third party providers and positive or negative publicity. 
 Adverse credit market conditions may limit the Company s ability to obtain future financing.  
 Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial institutions to fail, may cause lenders to reduce lending or may cause investors to reinvest in assets that are considered less risky. The failure of a financial institution that supports the Company s existing credit agreement would reduce the size of its committed facility unless a replacement institution was added.   Furthermore, the Company revised its existing financing structure to consummate the spinoff transactions,  through refinancing and debt tender and exchange transactions.  Any future capital markets transaction will be dependent on market conditions, which may result in the Company receiving financing on terms less favorable to the Company than its existing financings.   
 The Company s operating performance and creditworthiness may limit its ability to obtain future financing and the cost of any such capital may be higher than in past periods.  
 The Company s access to future financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the general availability of credit, its credit ratings and credit capacity at the time it pursues such financing. The Company s current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, the Company s borrowing costs may further increase or ability to borrow may be limited. The Company s obligations under its current $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) which expires September 30, 2021, are guaranteed by material and certain other domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including most of its domestic subsidiaries, and a security interest in substantially all of the domestic current assets and mortgages of certain domestic real property of the Company. The Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Leverage Ratio, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments, dispose of certain assets and may also limit the use of proceeds. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $60.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. If adequate capital is not available to the Company and its internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, or if future financings require more restrictive covenants, such combination of events could adversely affect the Company s ability to (i) acquire new businesses or enter new markets, (ii) service or refinance its existing debt, (iii) pay dividends on common stock, (iv) make necessary capital investments, and (v) make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of its business.  
   
 62 

The Company may not be able to reduce or extinguish any of its material indebtedness, and as a result the Company would have increased financial l  everage, which could adversely affect its business.  
 The Company will not be able to assign, and may not be able to reduce or extinguish, any of its material indebtedness.  The Company  has substantial indebtedness and if it is unable to reduce this indebtedness, the Company will have increased financial leverage since  the spinoff transactions are complete.  As a result of the transfer of certain businesses to LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions, the Company s interest and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness are expected to increase substantially in relation to its revenues and cash flows.  In addition, the Company s ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt, will depend largely upon its future operating performance. The Company s future operating performance may be adversely impacted by loss of earnings from businesses transferred to LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial Solutions.  
 The indentures governing the notes and debentures the Company issues do not contain restrictive covenants and the Company may incur substantially more debt or take other actions, including engaging in mergers and acquisitions, paying dividends and making other distributions to holders of equity securities, and disposing of certain assets, which may adversely affect the Company s ability to satisfy its obligations under the notes and debentures issued under its indentures.  
 Although the Credit Agreement is subject to a number of negative and financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, and covenants that restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers and acquisitions, pay dividends and make other distributions to the holders of the Company s equity securities, and dispose of certain assets, the indentures governing the Company s outstanding notes and debentures do not contain financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, the payment of dividends or making other distributions, or the disposition of certain assets. In addition, the limited covenants applicable to the notes and debentures do not require the Company to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to its financial position or results of operations.  
 In carrying out the Company s strategy focused on maximizing long-term stockholder value, the Company may enter into transactions which may increase its financial leverage. The Company s ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing its notes and debentures could have the effect of diminishing the Company s ability to make payments on those notes and debentures when due, and require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund the Company s operations, working capital and capital expenditures.  
 Fluctuations in the costs of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials may adversely impact the Company.  
 Purchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of the Company s costs. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase the Company s costs and the Company may not be able to pass these costs on to customers through higher prices. In addition, the Company may not be able to resell waste paper and other print-related by-products or may be adversely impacted by decreases in the prices for these by-products. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely impact customers  demand for the Company s printing and related services. 
   The Company may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.  
 The Company is dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support its operations. Unforeseen developments in these markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials and could cause a decline in the Company s revenues.   
 The Company may be unable to improve its operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions. 
 Because the markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive, the Company must continue to improve its operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve its profitability.  There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future.  In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology. 
   
 63 

The Company has in the past acquired and intends in the future to acquire other businesses, and the Company may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increa  sed net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.   
 Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the Company or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt the businesses of the Company or the acquired businesses. The Company s strategy is, in part, predicated on the Company s ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the Company s products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company s control. In particular, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.  
 The highly competitive market for the Company s products and industry consolidation may continue to create adverse price pressures.  
 The markets for the majority of the Company s product categories are highly fragmented and the Company has a large number of competitors. Management believes that excess capacity in the Company s markets has caused downward price pressure and that this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which the Company competes may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices.  
 The Company may be subject to more intensive competition if our competitors pursue consolidations.  
 The Company currently has a large number of competitors in the markets in which we operate. The Company believes that selectively pursuing acquisitions is an important strategy for our business following  the proposed spinoff transactions . If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another or otherwise consolidate, the competitive landscape we face could be significantly altered. Such consolidation could create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and, if we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the resulting increase in competitive pressures could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 
 The trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to the Company s employees and retirees may continue.  
 The Company provides health care and other benefits to both employees and retirees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, the Company s cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting the Company s profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. may also increase the Company s cost of providing such benefits.  
 Changes in market conditions or lower returns on assets may increase required pension and other postretirement benefits plan contributions in future periods.  
 The funded status of the Company s pension and other postretirement benefits plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions have increased the level of expected required pension and other postretirement benefits plan contributions in future years. Market conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate or worsen the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse market conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, the Company s costs and required cash contributions associated with pension and other postretirement benefits plans may substantially increase in future periods.  
   
 64 

Ca  tastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.   
 Natural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events could cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our customers, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature could also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and from performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 
 After the spinoff transactions, we may be more vulnerable to adverse events and trends associated with operations outside the United States.  
     Post the spinoff transactions, our business will be less diversified and focus only on variable   print and strategic services and will have significant operations outside the United States. As a result, the Company may be more exposed to the risks inherent in conducting such businesses and in conducting business outside the United States. Conducting b  usiness outside the United States subjects us to a number of additional risks and challenges, including: 

periodic changes in a specific country's or region's economic conditions, such as recession;     

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations (including those of municipalities or provinces where we have operations) and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, social insurance contributions and other payroll taxes and fees to governmental entities, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers;     

unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses;     

certification requirements;     

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those resulting from inflation, and currency devaluation activities;     

inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;     

potential political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts, and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are located;     

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas and cultures, including assuring compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U. S. and foreign anticorruption laws; and     

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.     

                       These factors, individually or in combination, could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products, result in unexpected and material expenses, or cause an unexpected decline in the demand for our products in certain countries or regions.   Specifically with respect to our operations in   China, our financial performance may be subject to the following risks, among others  : regulation of foreign investment and business activities by the Chinese government, including recent scrutiny of foreign co  mpanies, may limit our ability to expand our business in   China; uncertainties with respect to the legal system in   China may limit the legal protections available to us in   China; government restrictions on the remittance of currency out of China and the abi  lity of any subsidiary we may establish in   China to pay dividends and make other distributions to us; and potential unfavorable tax consequences as a result of our operations in China.  Our failure to manage the risks and challenges associated with our international business and operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 The Company is exposed to significant risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.  
 The Company is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which it does business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into the Company s consolidated financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that the Company s efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses that are material to the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
   
 65 

A decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units   of the Company could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.   
 The Company holds material amounts of goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on its balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of the Company s related goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write down or write off these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
 The substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials may continue to adversely affect the Company s businesses.  
 Electronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents. Consumers continue to accept electronic substitution in statement printing and forms while online and digital advertising is impacting customers  printed advertising spends. The extent to which consumers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future rates of acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has negatively impacted the Company s products, such as forms and statement printing. To the extent that consumers, customers and regulators continue to accept these alternatives, the Company s products will be adversely affected.  
 Changes in the rules and regulations to which the Company is subject may increase the Company s costs.  
 The Company is subject to numerous rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, product safety, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations. These rules and regulations may be changed by local, state or federal governments in countries in which the Company operates. Changes in these regulations may result in a significant increase in the Company s costs to comply. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to the Company s workforce, increased cost for compensation and benefits, or investments in new or upgraded equipment. In addition, growing concerns about climate change, including the impact of global warming, may result in new regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or  cap and trade  legislation. Compliance with new rules and regulations or changes in existing rules and regulations could result in additional costs to the Company.  
   Changes in the rules and regulations to which customers are subject may impact demand for the Company s products and services.  
 Many of the Company s customers are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications, governing the form of such communications and protecting the privacy of consumers.  For instance, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to such regulations. Changes in these regulations may impact customers  business practices and could reduce demand for the Company s products and services. Changes in such regulations could eliminate the need for certain types of communications altogether or such changes may impact the quantity or format of such communications.  
 Changes in postal rates, regulations and delivery structure may adversely impact demand for the Company s products and services.  
   Postal costs are a significant component of many of the Company s customers  cost structure and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces and types of mailings that the Company s customers mail. On December 24, 2013, the Postal Regulatory Commission (the  PRC ) approved the USPS Board of Governors  request for an exigent price increase of 4.3%. This exigent rate increase was implemented in addition to a 1.7% rate increase, equal to the CPI, for total price increases of 6.0%, on average, across all mail categories, effective January 26, 2014. On January 15, 2015, the USPS filed for a CPI rate increase of approximately 2.0%, which was approved by the PRC on May 7, 2015, and became effective May 31, 2015. The USPS eliminated the 4.3% exigency rate increase in April 2016. In addition, the USPS has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may, as a result, implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery. The USPS is continuing to pursue its previously announced plans to restructure its mail delivery network, including the closure of many post office facilities and a possible suspension of Saturday service. The impact to the Company of the USPS s restructuring plans, many of which   require legislative action, cannot currently be estimated. If implemented, such changes could impact customers  ability or willingness to communicate by mail. Declines in print volumes mailed would have an adverse effect on the Company s business.  
 We rely on independent shipping companies to deliver the products we create for our customers, and as part of our logistics business for our customers, changes in our relationships with these companies or an increase in shipping costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  
       We rely upon third party carriers, including FedEx and UPS, for timely delivery of our product shipments. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement  
   
 66 

weather and increased fuel costs. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers. If our relationship   with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to ship products for us, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers for the shipment of products to our custo  mers. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could   have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
   Furthermore, shipping costs represent   a significant operational expense for us. C hanges in shipping terms, or the inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively (whether as a result of mechanical failure, casualty loss, labor stoppage, or any other reason) could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our carriers could have an adverse impact on our shipping costs.  Any future increases in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers. 
 A failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of customers may adversely impact the Company s business. 
 Many of the end markets in which customers of the Company compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences.  In order to grow and remain competitive, the Company will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance the Company's existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of customers.  If the Company is unable to continue to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish its products and services from those of its competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, the Company s business may be adversely affected. 
 Technological developments and changing demands of customers may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies. The Company must monitor changes in its customers  markets and develop new solutions to meet customers  needs. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers. If the Company is unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, customers  demand for the Company s products and services may be adversely affected. 
 Undetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.  
 Our products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point in their lives, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platform are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and reductions in net sales and margins, any of which could negatively impact our business. 
 Our services depend on the reliability of computer systems maintained by us and our vendors and the ability to implement and maintain information technology and security measures to protect against security breaches and data leakage. Our failure to maintain the integrity of these systems could compromise the confidentiality of certain information provided to us by our customers and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business. 
 We depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems, or a security breach or a data leak that compromises the confidential and sensitive information stored in those systems, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage and power outages and are also susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency.  
   
 67 

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems,   software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our customers and users who rely on us to protect the confidentiality of certain information they provide us.  Many of our customers  industries are highly regulated and have establi  shed standards and requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers. Disclosure of the information maintained on our systems due to human error, breach of our systems th  rough hacking or cybercrime, a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or otherwise could materially damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory risks and cause significant reputational harm for our customers, all of which could hav  e a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Exhibit 10.36 
   
 R. R. DONNELLEY   SONS COMPANY 
  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 THIS AGREEMENT  (this  Agreement ) is entered into, effective as of _________________, 2016, between R. R. Donnelley   Sons Company, a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and _______________ ( Indemnitee ).  
 WHEREAS,  it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors the most capable persons available;  
 WHEREAS,  Indemnitee is a director of the Company;  
 WHEREAS,  both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims currently being asserted against directors of corporations; and  
 WHEREAS,  in recognition of Indemnitee s need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee s continued and effective service to the Company, and in order to induce Indemnitee to provide continued services to the Company as a director, the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement and for the coverage of Indemnitee under the Company s directors  and officers  liability insurance policies.  
 NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the above premises and of Indemnitee s continuing to serve as a director of the Company and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
 1.   Certain Definitions  :  
 (a)   Board  :  The Board of Directors of the Company.    
 (b)   Change in Control  :    
   (i)   any  person,  as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), as modified and used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) thereof (but not including (a) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (c) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (d) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company) (hereinafter a  Person ) is or becomes the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its affiliates, excluding an acquisition resulting from the exercise of a conversion or exchange privilege in respect of   

outstanding convertible or exchangeable securities) representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding securities; or   
 (ii)   during any period of two consecutive years beginning on the date hereof, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director designated by a Person who has entered into any agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Clause (i), (iii) or (iv) of this Section) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (each such director, a  Continuing Director ), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or

 (f)   Indemnifiable Event  :  Any event or occurrence that takes place either prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company, or while a director is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or related to anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity, whether or not the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director of the Company, or in any other capacity, as described above.  
 (g)   Independent Counsel  :  Means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) the Indemnitee or (iii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification or Expense Advances hereunder, in any matter (other than with respect to matters relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses).  No law firm or lawyer shall qualify to serve as Independent Counsel if that person would, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement.  The Company shall select a law firm or lawyer to serve as Independent Counsel, subject to the consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 2.   Agreement to Indemnify  .  
 (a)   General Agreement regarding Indemnification  .  In the event Indemnitee was, is, or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee from and against Indemnifiable Costs, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto); provided that the Company s commitment set forth in this Section 2(a) to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be subject to the limitations and procedural requirements set forth in this Agreement.    
   (b)   Partial Indemnification  .  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Indemnifiable Costs,   
 3 

but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.  
 (c)   Advancement of Expenses  .  If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee (an  Expense Advance  or an  Advance ) within 21 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a request from Indemnitee for an Advance, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding; provided that the Company shall not advance any expenses to Indemnitee unless and until it shall have received a request and  undertaking substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A  .  Any request for an Expense Advance shall be accompanied by an itemization, in reasonable detail, of the Expenses for which advancement is sought; provided however that Indemnitee need not submit to the Company any information that counsel for Indemnitee deems is privileged and exempt from compulsory disclosure in any proceeding.  Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses.  If Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in Section 4, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed). Indemnitee s obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.    
 (d)   Exception to Obligation to Indemnify and Advance Expenses  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless (i) the Company has joined in or the Board has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding; or (ii) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 5.  
 3.   Reviewing Party  .  
 (a)   Definition of Reviewing Party  . Other than as contemplated by Section 3(b), the person, persons or entity  who shall determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in the first instance ( the Reviewing Party ) shall be (i) the Board of Directors of the Company acting by a majority vote of a quorum of Disinterested Directors or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written determination to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.  
   (b)   Reviewing Party Following Change in Control  . After a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors), the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Counsel.  With respect to all matters arising from such a Change in Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or   
 4 

hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from the Independent Counsel.    Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys  fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of Independent Counsel pursuant hereto.  
 4.   Indemnification Process and Appeal.  
 (a)   Indemnification Payment  .     
 (i)   The determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall, to the extent practicable, be made by the Reviewing Party not later than 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written demand on the Company for indemnification (which written demand shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification).  The Reviewing Party making the determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall notify Indemnitee of such written determination no later than two business days thereafter.    
 (ii)   Unless the Reviewing Party has provided a written determination to the Company that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs, and shall receive payment thereof, from the Company in accordance with this Agreement within 10 business days after the Reviewing Party has made its determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification.   
 (b)   Suit to Enforce Rights  .  If (i) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made within the time limitation for such a determination set forth in Section 4(a)(i), (ii) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) is not made within the period permitted for such payment by such section, (iii) the Reviewing Party determines pursuant to Section 4(a) that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) Indemnitee has not received advancement of Expenses within the time period permitted for such advancement by Section 2(c), then Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the indemnification and advancement rights granted under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof.  The Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding.  Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by the Indemnitee within six months of the date of the Reviewing Party s determination shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.  The remedy provided for in this Section 4 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee in law or equity.  
 (c)   Defense to Indemnification, Burden of Proof, and Presumptions  .  
 5 

(i)    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification (or payment of Expense Advances) hereunder, the Reviewing Party shall presume that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (or payment of Expense Advances) under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Reviewing Party of any determination contrary to that presumption.  
 (ii)   It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.  
 (iii)   For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval and whether with or without an admission of liability on the part of the Indemnitee), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  
 (iv)     For purposes of any determination under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Company. The provisions of this Section 4(c)(iv) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.  
 (v)   The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  
 5.   Indemnification for Expenses Incurred in Enforcing Rights  .    The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law and, if requested by Indemnitee pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2(c), shall advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by Indemnitee for:  
 (i)   enforcement of this Agreement;  
   (ii)   indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs or Expense Advances by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the   
 6 

Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events; and/or  
 (iii)   recovery under directors  and officers  liability insurance policies maintained by the Company.  
 6.   Notification and Defense of Proceeding.  
 (a)   Notice  .  Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement thereof.  The failure to notify or promptly notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement, and shall not relieve the Company from liability hereunder except to the extent the Company has been prejudiced or as further provided in Section 6(c).  
 (b)   Defense  .  With respect to any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense and except as otherwise provided below, to the extent the Company so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Company.  After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any Proceeding, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such Proceeding, but all Expenses related thereto incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense shall be at Indemnitee s expense unless: (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of the Proceeding, (iii) after a Change in Control, the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been approved by the Independent Counsel, or (iv) the Company shall not within 60 calendar days in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which case all Expenses of the Proceeding shall be borne by the Company.  If the Company has selected counsel to represent Indemnitee and other current and former directors, officers or employees of the Company in the defense of a Proceeding, and a majority of such persons, including Indemnitee, reasonably object to such counsel selected by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this   Section 6(b)  , then such persons, including Indemnitee, shall be permitted to employ one additional counsel of their choice and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , that such counsel shall be chosen from amongst the list of counsel, if any, approved by any company with which the Company obtains or maintains insurance.  In the event separate counsel is retained by a group of persons including Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 6(b), the Company shall cooperate with such counsel with respect to the defense of the Proceeding, including making documents, witnesses and other reasonable information related to the defense available to such separate counsel pursuant to joint-defense agreements or confidentiality agreements, as appropriate.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Indemnitee shall have made the determination provided for in (ii) above.  
 7 

(c)    Settlement of Claims  .    The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without the Company s written consent.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee s written consent.  Neither the Company nor the Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.  The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement with regard to any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action; the Company s liability hereunder shall not be excused if participation in the Proceeding by the Company was barred by this Agreement.  
 7.   Non-Exclusivity  .    The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the laws of the State of Delaware, the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  
 8.   Liability Insurance  .    To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors  or officers  liability insurance, Indemnitee, if a director of the Company, shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms.  
 9.   Amendment of this Agreement  .    No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  Except as specifically provided herein, no failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver thereof.  
 10.   Subrogation  .    In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  
 11.   No Duplication of Payments  .    The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (whether under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s Amended and Restated By-laws, any insurance policy, by law, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.  
   12.   Binding Effect  .    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and   
 8 

legal representatives.  The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company s request.  
 13.   Severability  .    If any provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, void, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, void, or unenforceable.  
 14.   Governing Law  .    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.  
 15.   Entire Agreement.    Subject to Section 7 hereof, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written, and implied, including the Prior Agreement, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.    
 16.   Notices  .    All notices, demands, and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand, against receipt, or mailed, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and addressed
