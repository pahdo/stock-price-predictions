  October 29, 2016    
  (Unaudited) 

(1) General  
  EVINE Live Inc. and its subsidiaries ("we," "our," "us," or the "Company") are collectively a digital commerce company that offers a mix of proprietary, exclusive and name brand merchandise directly to consumers in an engaging and informative shopping experience through TV, online and mobile devices.  The Company operates a 24-hour television shopping network, EVINE, which is distributed primarily on cable and satellite systems, through which it offers proprietary, exclusive and name brand merchandise in the categories of jewelry   watches; home   consumer electronics; beauty; and fashion   accessories.  Orders are taken via telephone, online and mobile channels.  The television network is distributed into approximately   87 million   homes, primarily through cable and satellite affiliation agreements and agreements with telecommunications companies such as AT T and Verizon.  Programming is also streamed live online at evine.com and is also available on mobile channels. Programming is also distributed through a Company-owned full power television station in Boston, Massachusetts and through leased carriage on a full power television station in Seattle, Washington.  
  The Company also operates evine.com, a comprehensive digital commerce platform that sells products which appear on its television shopping network as well as an extended assortment of online-only merchandise.  The live programming and products are also marketed via mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, and through the leading social media channels. 
  On November 18, 2014, the Company announced that it had changed its corporate name to EVINE Live Inc. from ValueVision Media, Inc. Effective November 20, 2014, the Company's NASDAQ trading symbol also changed to EVLV from VVTV. The Company transitioned from doing business as "ShopHQ" to "EVINE Live" and evine.com on February 14, 2015.   

(2) Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted in accordance with these rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   January 30, 2016   has been derived from the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .  The information furnished in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of these financial statements. Although management believes the disclosures and information presented are adequate, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s most recent audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  . Operating results for the   nine-month period   ended   October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   January 28, 2017  .  
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Fiscal Year 
  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31.  References to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years.  The Company s most recently completed fiscal year,   fiscal 2015  , ended on   January 30, 2016  , and consisted of 52 weeks.     Fiscal 2016   will end on   January 28, 2017  , and will contain 52 weeks.  The quarters ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   each consisted of 13 weeks. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Updates 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, Subtopic 835-30 (Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU 2015-03.  The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, applying it retrospectively.  The consolidated balance sheet as  
  
    7 

     Table of Contents  

of January 30, 2016 reflects the reclassification of debt issuance costs of   $266,000   from other assets to long term credit facilities. The amount of debt issuance costs included in long term credit facilities as of   October 29, 2016   was   $1.5 million  . In August 2015, the FASB issued Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, Subtopic 835-30 (ASU No. 2015-15), which clarifies that absent authoritative guidance in ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the revolving line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit arrangement. As of January 30, 2016, debt issuance costs of   $694,000   related to our PNC Credit Agreement, revolving line of credit were included within other assets.  We continue to include these costs within other assets, amortizing them over the term of the PNC Credit Agreement.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 (ASU No. 2014-09), which provides a framework for the recognition of revenue, with the objective that recognized revenues properly reflect amounts an entity is entitled to receive in exchange for goods and services. The guidance, also includes additional disclosure requirements regarding revenue, cash flows and obligations related to contracts with customers.  In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved a one year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09.  The standard will now become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, Topic 330 (ASU No. 2015-11).  ASU 2015-11 changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost or net realizable value. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, Topic 740 (ASU No. 2015-17).  ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted and applied either prospectively or retrospectively.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-17 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Leases, Topic 842 (ASU No. 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  The new standard is effective retrospectively for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Compensation-Stock Compensation, Topic 718 (ASU No. 2016-09).  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, the ASU also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards.  The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Cash Flows, Topic 230 (ASU No. 2016-15).  This amendment provides guidance on the presentation and classification of specific cash flow items to improve consistency in practice.  The new standard is effective retrospectively for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements. 

(3) Fair Value Measurements 
  GAAP utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurement), then priority to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which  
  
    8 

     Table of Contents  

all significant assumptions are observable in the market (Level 2 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). 
  As of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016   the Company had   $450,000   in Level 2 investments in the form of bank certificates of deposit.  The Company's investments in certificates of deposits were measured using inputs based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 investments.  As of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016   the Company also had long-term variable rate Credit Facilities, classified as Level 2, with carrying values of   $86,115,000   and   $72,414,000  , respectively.  As of   October 29, 2016   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively,   $2,993,000   and   $2,143,000   was classified as current. The fair value of the variable rate Credit Facilities approximates and is based on its carrying value.  The Company has   no   Level 3 investments that use significant unobservable inputs. 

(4) Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following: 

As of   January 30, 2016  , the Company had an intangible FCC broadcasting license with a carrying value of   $12,000,000   and an estimated fair value of   $12,900,000  .  The Company annually reviews its FCC television broadcast license for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an impairment indicator is present. The Company estimates the fair value of its FCC television broadcast license primarily by using income-based discounted cash flow models with the assistance of an independent outside fair value consultant. The discounted cash flow models utilize a range of assumptions including revenues, operating profit margin, projected capital expenditures and an unobservable discount rate.  The Company also considers comparable asset market and sales data for recent comparable market transactions for standalone television broadcasting stations to assist in determining fair value.  The Company concluded that the inputs used in its intangible FCC broadcasting license asset valuation are Level 3 inputs related to this valuation.   
  While the Company believes that its estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of the license are reasonable, different assumptions or future events could materially affect its valuation.  In addition, due to the illiquid nature of this asset, the Company's valuation for this license could be materially different if it were to decide to sell it in the short term which, upon revaluation, could result in a future impairment of this asset. 
   The EVINE trademark asset is included in Other Assets in the accompanying balance sheets.  Amortization expense related to the EVINE trademark license was   $18,000   for the three-month periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . Amortization expense related to the EVINE trademark license was   $61,000   and   $43,000   for the   nine-month periods   ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. Estimated amortization expense for   fiscal 2016   and each of the subsequent fiscal years is   $80,000   and   $74,000  , respectively.

(5) Credit Agreements 
  The Company's long-term credit facilities consist of: 

PNC Credit Facility 
  On February 9, 2012, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement (as amended through September 7, 2016, the "PNC Credit Facility") with PNC Bank, N.A. ("PNC"), a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as lender and agent.  The PNC Credit Facility, which includes The Private Bank as part of the facility, provides a revolving line of credit of   $90.0 million   and provides for a   $15 million   term loan on which the Company has drawn to fund improvements at the Company's distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The PNC Credit Facility also provides an accordion feature that would allow the Company to expand the size of the revolving line of credit by another   $25.0 million   at the discretion of the lenders and upon certain conditions being met.   
  All borrowings under the PNC Credit Facility mature and are payable on May 1, 2020.  Subject to certain conditions, the PNC Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to   $6.0 million   which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the PNC Credit Facility.  Maximum borrowings and available capacity under the revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility are equal to the lesser of   $90.0 million   or a calculated borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. The PNC Credit Facility is secured by a first security interest in substantially all of the Company s personal property, as well as the Company s real properties located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Bowling Green, Kentucky up to   $13 million  .  Under certain circumstances, the borrowing base may be adjusted if there were to be a significant deterioration in value of the Company s accounts receivable and inventory. 
  The revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of between   3%   and   4.5%   based on the Company's trailing twelve-month reported EBITDA (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) measured quarterly in fiscal 2016 and semi-annually thereafter as demonstrated in its financial statements.  The term loan bears interest at either a Base Rate or LIBOR plus a margin consisting of between   4%   and   5%   on Base Rate term loans and   5%   to   6%   on LIBOR rate loans based on our annual leverage ratio as demonstrated in its audited financial statements.  
   As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had borrowings of   $59.9 million   under its revolving credit facility.  Remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of   October 29, 2016   is approximately   $16.2 million  , and provides liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes. The PNC Credit Facility also provides for a   $15.0 million   term loan on which the Company has drawn to fund an expansion and improvements at the Company's distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  As of   October 29, 2016  , there was approximately   $11.2 million   outstanding under the PNC Credit Facility term loan of which   $2.1 million   was classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet. 
  Principal borrowings under the term loan are to be payable in monthly installments over an   84   month amortization period commencing on January 1, 2015 and are also subject to mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, upon receipt of certain proceeds from dispositions of collateral.  Borrowings under the term loan are also subject to mandatory prepayment starting in the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 in an amount equal to fifty percent (  50%  ) of excess cash flow for such fiscal year, with any such payment not to exceed   $2.0 million   in any such fiscal year.  The PNC Credit Facility is also subject to other mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances. In addition, if the total PNC Credit Facility is terminated prior to maturity,  
  
    10 

     Table of Contents  

the Company would be required to pay an early termination fee of   1.0%   if terminated on or before October 8, 2017,   0.5%   if terminated on or before October 8, 2018; and   no   fee if terminated after October 8, 2018.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the imputed effective interest rate on the PNC term loan was   7.3%  . 
  Interest expense recorded under the PNC Credit Facility for the three- and   nine-month periods   ended   October 29, 2016   was   $997,000   and   $2,864,000  , respectively, and   $684,000   and   $1,945,000   for the three- and   nine-month periods   ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The PNC Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus facility availability of   $10.0 million   at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures.  As our unused line availability was greater than   $10.0 million   at   October 29, 2016  , no additional cash was required to be restricted.  Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.1 to 1.0  , become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus facility availability falls below   $18.0 million  .  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company's unrestricted cash plus facility availability was   $55.8 million   and the Company was in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the PNC Credit Facility and expects to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months.  In addition, the PNC Credit Facility places restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders.   
  Costs incurred to obtain amendments to the PNC Credit Facility totaling   $1,181,000   and unamortized costs incurred to obtain the original PNC Credit Facility totaling   $466,000   have been deferred and are being expensed as additional interest over the   five  -year term of the PNC Credit Facility.  
  Great American Capital Partners Credit Agreement  
  On March 10, 2016, the Company entered into a term loan credit and security agreement (as amended on November 7, 2016, the "GACP Credit Agreement") with GACP Finance Co., LLC ("GACP") for a term loan of   $17.0 million  .  Proceeds from the GACP Credit Agreement will be used to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes and to help strengthen the Company's total liquidity position. The term loan under the GACP Credit Agreement (the "GACP Term Loan") is secured on a first lien priority basis by the proceeds of any sale of the Company's Boston television station FCC license and on a second lien priority basis by the Company's accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and certain real estate as well as other assets as described in the GACP Credit Agreement.  The Company has also pledged the stock of certain subsidiaries to secure such obligations on a second lien priority basis. 
  The GACP Credit Agreement matures on March 9, 2021. The GACP Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a fixed rate based on the greater of LIBOR for interest periods of   one  ,   two   or   three   months or   1%   plus a margin of   11.0%  , or (ii) a daily floating Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of   10.0%  .  As of   October 29, 2016  , the imputed effective interest rate on the GACP term loan was   14.0%  . 
  Principal borrowings under the GACP Term Loan are to be payable in consecutive monthly installments of   $70,833   each, commencing on April 1, 2016, with a final installment due at the end of the   five  -year term equal to the aggregate principal amount of all loans outstanding on such date.  The GACP Term Loan is also subject to mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including, but without limitation, from the proceeds of the sale of collateral assets and from   50%   of annual excess cash flow as defined in the GACP Credit Agreement.  The GACP Term Loan can be prepaid voluntarily at any time and, if terminated prior to maturity, the Company would be required to pay an early termination fee of   3.0%   if terminated on or before March 10, 2017;   2.0%   if terminated on or before March 10, 2018;   1.0%   if terminated on or before March 10, 2019; and   no   fee if terminated after March 10, 2019.   Interest expense recorded under the GACP Credit Agreement was   $585,000   and   $1,519,000   for the three and   nine-month periods   ended   October 29, 2016  .         
  The GACP Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and conditions, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus revolving line of credit availability under the PNC Credit Facility of   $10.0 million   at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures.  Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the GACP Credit Agreement) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.1 to 1.0  , become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus revolving line of credit availability under the PNC Credit Facility falls below   $18.0 million  .  In addition, the GACP Credit Agreement places restrictions on the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders.   
  Costs incurred to obtain the GACP Credit Agreement totaling   $1,475,000   have been deferred and are being expensed as additional interest over the   five  -year term of the GACP Credit Agreement.

(6) Shareholders' Equity 
  Private Placement Securities Purchase Agreements  
  On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into private placement securities purchase agreements ("Purchase Agreements") with certain accredited investors to which the Company: (a) sold, in the aggregate,   5,952,381   shares of the Company's common stock at a price of   $1.68   per share; (b) issued five-year warrants ("Warrants") to purchase   2,976,190   shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of   $2.90   per share, and (c) issued an option by which certain investors may purchase additional shares of Company's common stock and additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock ("Options").   
  The Company received gross proceeds of   $10.0 million   and incurred approximately   $868,000   of issuance costs.  The Warrants will expire on   September 19, 2021   and are not exercisable until   March 19, 2017  .  The term of each option is   six months   and expire on March 19, 2017, provided, however, that an option may not be exercised for the first   30 days   following issuance. Each option may only be exercised once, in whole or in part, and the future potential investment offering will have a price equal to the   five  -day volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock as of the day immediately prior to exercise.  Upon exercise of the Options, two-thirds of the option securities will be issued in the form of common stock, and one-third will be issued in the form of warrants ("Option Warrants"). These Option Warrants will have an exercise price at a   50%   premium to the Company's closing stock price one-day prior to the option exercise and will expire   five years   after issuance.  If all of the Warrants, Options and Option Warrants issued by the Company are all exercised, the total shares of common stock issued in connection with this offering cannot be more than approximately   19.99%   of the Company's total issued and outstanding shares following such exercises.  
  The Company allocated the   $10 million   proceeds of the stock offering to each of the issued freestanding financial instruments based on their fair value at the time of issuance. The Warrants are indexed to the Company's publicly traded stock and were classified as equity.  As a result, the portion of the proceeds allocated to the fair value of the Warrants was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.  The fair value of the Options was determined to be nominal.  The par value of the shares issued was recorded within common stock, with the remainder of the proceeds, less offering costs, recorded as additional paid in capital in the Company's balance sheet.  The Company plans to use the proceeds for general working capital purposes. 
  As part of the Purchase Agreements, the Company agreed to register the shares of common stock sold in the private placement and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, Options and Option Warrants.  Specifically, the Company agreed to (i) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the registrable securities within   30   days after the closing date; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to have the shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as possible after the initial filing, and in any event no later than   90   days after the closing date (or   120   days in the event of a full review of the shelf registration statement by the SEC); and (iii) keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of the second anniversary of the closing or such time as all registrable securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, without the need for current public information or other restriction.  The Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the common stock sold in the private placement and issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and Options.

  Stock-Based Compensation - Stock Option Awards  
  Compensation is recognized for all stock-based compensation arrangements by the Company.  Stock-based compensation expense for the   third   quarters of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015   related to stock option awards was   $119,000   and   $317,000  , respectively.  Stock-based compensation expense for the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015   related to stock option awards was   $374,000   and   $904,000  , respectively.  The Company has not recorded any income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options due to the uncertainty of realizing income tax benefits in the future. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had   one   omnibus stock plan for which stock awards can be currently granted: the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of up to   9,500,000   shares of the Company's stock.  The 2004 Omnibus Stock Plan expired on June 22, 2014.  No further awards may be made under the 2004 Omnibus Plan, but any award granted under the 2004 Omnibus Plan and outstanding on June 22, 2014 will remain outstanding in accordance with its terms.  The 2001 Omnibus Stock Plan expired on June 21, 2011.  No further awards may be made under the 2001 Omnibus Plan, but any award granted under the 2001 Omnibus Plan and outstanding on June 21, 2011 will remain outstanding in accordance with its terms.  The 2011 plan is administered by the human resources and compensation committee of the board of directors and provides for awards for employees, directors and consultants. All employees and directors of the Company and its affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the plan. The types of awards that may be granted under this plan include restricted and unrestricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive and nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, and other stock-based awards. Incentive stock options may be granted to employees at such exercise prices as the human resources and compensation committee may determine but not less than   100%   of the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date of grant. No incentive stock option may be granted more than   10   years after the effective date of the respective plan's inception or be exercisable more than   10 years   after the date of grant. Options granted to outside directors are nonstatutory stock options with an exercise price equal to   100%   of the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date of grant. With the exception of market-based options, options granted generally vest over   three   years in the case of employee stock options and vest immediately on the date of grant in the case of director options, and have contractual terms of   10 years   from the date of grant.  
   The fair value of each time-based vesting option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock. Expected term is calculated using the simplified method taking into consideration the option's contractual life and vesting terms.  The Company uses the simplified method in estimating its expected option term because it believes that historical exercise data cannot be accurately relied upon at this time to provide a reasonable basis for estimating an expected term due to the extreme volatility of its stock price and the resulting unpredictability of its stock option exercises. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yields were not used in the fair value computations as the Company has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and currently intends to retain earnings for use in operations.

  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Bob Rosenblatt was appointed as permanent Chief Executive Officer and entered into an executive employment agreement.  In conjunction with the employment agreement, the Company granted, to Mr. Rosenblatt,   231,799   shares of market-based restricted stock performance units as part of the Company's long-term incentive program.  The number of restricted stock units earned is based on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to a group of industry peers over a three-year performance measurement period.  The total grant date fair value was estimated to be   $422,000  , or   $1.82   per share and is being amortized over the   three  -year performance period. Grant date fair values were determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on assumptions, which included a weighted average risk-free interest rate of   0.76%  , a weighted average expected life of   three   years and an implied volatility of   77%  .  The percent of the target market-based performance vested restricted stock unit award that will be earned based on the Company's TSR relative to the peer group is as follows:

(7) Net Loss Per Common Share 
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing reported loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reported period. Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock of the Company during reported periods.

A reconciliation of net loss per share calculations and the number of shares used in the calculation of basic loss per share and diluted loss per share is as follows: 

(a) The net loss for the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 29, 2016   includes costs related to executive and management transition of   $568,000   and   $4,411,000  , respectively, and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs totaling   $150,000   and   $530,000  , respectively.  The net loss for the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 31, 2015   includes costs related to executive and management transition of   $754,000   and   $3,549,000  , respectively, and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs totaling   $294,000   and   $1,266,000  , respectively.    
  (b) For the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 29, 2016  , approximately   796,000   and   58,000  , respectively, incremental in-the-money potentially dilutive common shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, as the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive.  For the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 31, 2015  , approximately -  0  - and   71,000  , respectively, incremental in-the-money potentially dilutive common shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, as the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive.  

(8) Business Segments and Sales by Product Group 
  The Company has   one   reporting segment, which encompasses its digital commerce retailing.  The Company markets, sells and distributes its products to consumers primarily through its digital commerce television, online website evine.com and mobile platforms.  The Company's television shopping, online and mobile platforms have similar economic characteristics with respect to products, product sourcing, vendors, marketing and promotions, gross margins, customers, and methods of distribution.  In addition, the Company believes that its television shopping program is a key driver of traffic to both the evine.com website and mobile applications whereby many of the online sales originate from customers viewing the Company's television program and then place their orders online or through mobile devices.  All of the Company's sales are made to customers residing in the United States.  The chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Information on net sales by significant product groups are as follows (in thousands):

(9) Income Taxes  
  At   January 30, 2016  , the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately   $312 million  , and state NOLs of approximately   $200 million   which are available to offset future taxable income.  The Company's federal NOLs expire in varying amounts each year from 2023 through 2035 in accordance with applicable federal tax regulations and the timing of when the NOLs were incurred.  
   In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company had a change in ownership (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) as a result of the issuance of common stock coupled with the redemption of all the Series B Preferred Stock held by GE Equity.  Sections 382 and 383 limit the annual utilization of certain tax attributes, including NOL carryforwards, incurred prior to a change in ownership. Currently, the limitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 are not expected to impair the Company's ability to fully realize its NOLs; however, the annual usage of NOLs incurred prior to the change in ownership is limited.  In addition, if the Company were to experience another ownership change, as defined by Sections 382 and 383, its ability to utilize its NOLs could be further substantially limited and depending on the severity of the annual NOL limitation, the Company could permanently lose its ability to use a significant amount of its accumulated NOLs.  The Company currently has recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets.  The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets and related limitations depend on the ability of the Company to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, as well as the timing of such income. 
  For both the   third   quarters of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , the income tax provision included a non-cash tax charge of approximately   $197,000   relating to changes in the Company's long-term deferred tax liability related to the tax amortization of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible FCC license asset that is not available to offset existing deferred tax assets in determining changes to our income tax valuation allowance. For the first   nine-months   of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , the income tax provision included a non-cash charge of approximately   $592,000   and   $591,000  , respectively. The Company expects the continued tax amortization of its indefinite-lived intangible asset and resulting book versus tax asset carrying value difference to result in approximately   $197,000   of additional non-cash income tax expense over the remainder of   fiscal 2016  .  
  Shareholder Rights Plan 
  During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses.  On July 10, 2015, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one purchase right (a  Right ) for each outstanding share of the Company s common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 23, 2015 and issuable as of that date, and on July 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Shareholder Rights Plan (the  Plan ) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, with respect to the Rights.  Except in certain circumstances set forth in the Plan, each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock,   $0.01   par value, of the Company ( Preferred Stock  and each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, a  Unit ) at a price of   $9.00   per Unit.  
  The Rights initially trade together with the common stock and are not exercisable.  Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Plan, the Rights will separate from the common stock and become exercisable following (i) the tenth calendar day after a public announcement or filing that a person or group has become an  Acquiring Person,  which is defined as a person who has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of   4.99%   or more of the common stock then outstanding, subject to certain exceptions, or (ii) the tenth calendar day (or such later date as may be determined by the board of directors) after any person or group commences a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.  If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right will entitle its holders (other than such Acquiring Person) to purchase one Unit at a price of   $9.00   per Unit.  A Unit is intended to give the shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as would one share of Common Stock, and should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.  At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, the board of directors may exchange all or part of the outstanding Rights (other than those held by an Acquiring Person) for shares of common stock at an exchange rate of one share of common stock (and, in certain circumstances, a Unit) for each Right. The Company will promptly give public notice of any exchange (although failure to give notice will not affect the validity of the exchange). 
  The Rights will expire upon certain events described in the Plan, including the close of business on the date of the third annual meeting of shareholders following the last annual meeting of shareholders of the Company at which the Plan was most recently approved by shareholders, unless the Plan is re-approved by shareholders at that third annual meeting of shareholders.  However, in no event will the Plan expire later than the close of business on July 13, 2025.  The Plan was approved by the Company s shareholders at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders.  
  Until the close of business on the tenth calendar day after the day a public announcement or a filing is made indicating that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion amend the Rights or the Plan agreement without the approval of any holders of the Rights or shares of common stock in any manner, including without limitation, amendments that increase or decrease the purchase price or redemption price or accelerate or extend the final expiration date or the period in which the Rights may be redeemed. The Company may also amend the Plan after the close of business on

the tenth calendar day after the day such public announcement or filing is made to cure ambiguities, to correct defective or inconsistent provisions, to shorten or lengthen time periods under the Plan or in any other manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights. No amendment of the Plan may extend its expiration date. 

(10) Litigation 
  The Company is involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the claims and suits individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on the Company s operations or consolidated financial statements. 

(11) Related Party Transactions 
  Relationship with GE Equity, Comcast and NBCU 
  Until April 29, 2016 the Company was a party to an amended and restated shareholder agreement, dated February 25, 2009 (the  GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement ), with GE Capital Equity Investments, Inc. ( GE Equity ) and NBCUniversal Media, LLC ( NBCU ), which provided for certain corporate governance and standstill matters (as described further below). NBCU is an indirect subsidiary of Comcast Corporation ( Comcast ). The Company believes that as of   October 29, 2016  , the direct equity ownership of NBCU in the Company consists of   7,141,849   shares of common stock, or approximately   11.2%   of the Company s current outstanding common stock. The Company has a significant cable distribution agreement with Comcast and believe that the terms of the agreement are comparable to those with other cable system operators.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company received a   $500,000   cash payment from a wholly owned subsidiary of NBCUniversal for the right to use a specified channel in the Boston, Massachusetts' designated market area.  
  In an SEC filing made on August 18, 2015, GE Equity disclosed that on August 14, 2015, it and ASF Radio, L.P. ( ASF Radio ), an independent third party to us, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which GE Equity agreed to sell   3,545,049   shares of the Company s common stock, which is all of the shares GE Equity currently owns, to ASF Radio for   $2.15   per share. According to the SEC filing, ASF Radio is an affiliate of Ardian, an independent private equity investment company. The closing of this sale (the  GE/ASF Radio Sale ) occurred on April 29, 2016. In connection with the GE/ASF Radio Sale, the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement was terminated and the Company and NBCU entered into a new Shareholder Agreement (the  NBCU Shareholder Agreement ) described below. 
    
  GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement 
  The GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement that was terminated April 29, 2016 provided that GE Equity was entitled to designate nominees for   three   members of our Board of Directors so long as the aggregate beneficial ownership of GE Equity and NBCU (and their affiliates) was at least equal to   50%   of their beneficial ownership as of February 25, 2009 (i.e., beneficial ownership of approximately   8.7 million   common shares) (the    50%   Ownership Condition ), and   two   members of our Board of Directors so long as their aggregate beneficial ownership was at least   10%   of the shares of  adjusted outstanding common stock,  as defined in the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement (the    10%   Ownership Condition ). In addition, the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement provided that GE Equity may designate any of its director-designees to be an observer of the audit, human resources and compensation, and corporate governance and nominating committees of our Board of Directors. Neither GE Equity   no  r NBCU currently has, or during fiscal 2016 had, any designees serving on our Board of Directors or committees. 
  The GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement required that the Company obtain the consent of GE Equity before the Company (i) exceeded certain thresholds relating to the issuance of securities, the payment of dividends, the repurchase or redemption of common stock, acquisitions (including investments and joint ventures) or dispositions, and the incurrence of debt; (ii) entered into any business different than the business in which the Company and our subsidiaries are currently engaged; and (iii) amended our articles of incorporation to adversely affect GE Equity and NBCU (or their affiliates); provided, however, that these restrictions would no longer apply when both (1) GE Equity is no longer entitled to designate   three   director nominees, and (2) GE Equity and NBCU no longer hold any Series B preferred stock. The Company was also prohibited from taking any action that would cause any ownership interest by us in television broadcast stations from being attributable to GE Equity, NBCU or their affiliates. 
    
  NBCU Shareholder Agreement 
  On April 29, 2016, the Company entered into the NBCU Shareholder Agreement with NBCU. The NBCU Shareholder Agreement replaced the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement. The NBCU Shareholder Agreement provides that as long as NBCU or its affiliates beneficially own at least   5%   of our outstanding common stock, NBCU will be entitled to designate   one   individual  
  
    19 

     Table of Contents  

to be nominated to the Company s Board of Directors. In addition, the NBCU Shareholder Agreement provides that NBCU may designate its director designee to be an observer of the audit, human resources and compensation, and corporate governance and nominating committees of our Board of Directors. In addition, the NBCU Shareholder Agreement requires the Company to obtain the consent of NBCU prior to our adoption or amendment of any shareholder s rights plan or certain other actions that would impede or restrict the ability of NBCU to acquire our voting stock or our taking any action that would result in NBCU being deemed to be in violation of the Federal Communications Commission multiple ownership regulations. 
  Unless NBCU beneficially owns less than   5%    or more than   90%   of the adjusted outstanding shares of common stock, NBCU may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company subject to limited exceptions for (i) transfers to affiliates, (ii) third party tender offers, (iii) mergers, consolidations and reorganizations and (iv) transfers pursuant to underwritten public offerings or transfers exempt from registration under the Securities Act (provided, in the case of (iv), such transfers do not result in the transferee acquiring beneficial ownership in excess of   20%  ). 
    
  Registration Rights Agreement 
  On February 25, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement that, as further amended, provided GE Equity, NBCU and their affiliates and any transferees and assigns, an aggregate of five demand registrations and unlimited piggy-back registration rights. In connection with the GE/ASF Radio Sale, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement was entered into removing GE Equity as a party and adding ASF Radio, L.P. as a party. 
    
  2015 Letter Agreement with GE Equity 
  On July 9, 2015, the Company entered into a letter agreement with GE Equity pursuant to which GE Equity consented to our adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan in consideration for our agreement to provide GE Equity, NBCU and certain of their respective affiliates with exemptions from the Shareholder Rights Plan. GE Equity s consent was required pursuant to the terms of the GE/NBCU Shareholder Agreement. This discussion is a summary of the terms of the letter agreement. In the letter agreement, the Company agreed that if any of GE Equity, NBCU or any of their respective affiliates that holds shares of our common stock from time to time (each a  Grandfathered Investor ) sells or otherwise transfers shares of our common stock currently owned by such Grandfathered Investor to any third party identified to us in writing (any such third party, an  Exempt Purchaser ), the Company will take all actions necessary under the Shareholder Rights Plan so that such third party will not be deemed an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Shareholder Rights Plan) by virtue of the acquisition of such shares. The Company further agreed that, subject to certain limitations, upon request of any Grandfathered Investor or Exempt Purchaser, and in connection with a transfer by such Grandfathered Investor or Exempt Purchaser of shares of our common stock to an Exempt Purchaser, the Company will enter into an agreement with the acquiring Exempt Purchaser granting such acquiring Exempt Purchaser substantially the same rights as set forth above with respect to any sale of our outstanding shares of common stock to any other third party. Additionally, the Company agreed that without the consent of any Grandfathered Investor that is an affiliate of GE Equity and any Grandfathered Investor that is an affiliate of NBCU, the Company will not (i) amend the Shareholder Rights Plan in any material respect, other than to accelerate the Expiration Date or the Final Expiration Date, (ii) adopt another shareholders  rights plan or (iii) amend the letter agreement. 
    
  Director Relationships  
  The Company entered into a service agreement with Newgistics, Inc. ("Newgistics") in fiscal 2004.  Newgistics provides offsite customer returns consolidation and delivery services to the Company.  The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Rosenblatt, is a member of Newgistics Board of Directors. The Company made payments to Newgistics totaling approximately   $1,255,000   and   $3,789,000   during the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively and payments totaling approximately   $1,152,000   and   $3,563,000   during the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  One of the Company's directors, Thomas Beers, has a minority interest in one of the Company's on air food suppliers.  The Company made inventory payments to this supplier totaling approximately   $412,000   and   $1,635,000   during the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively and payments totaling approximately   $2,129,000   and   $2,892,000   during the three and   nine-month period  s ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  

(12) Distribution Facility Expansion, Consolidation   Technology Upgrade 
  During fiscal 2014, the Company began a significant operational expansion initiative with respect to overall warehousing capacity and new equipment and system technology upgrades at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution facility.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the new building was substantially completed and expanded our   262,000   square foot facility to an approximately   600,000   square foot facility.  Subsequently, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company finished the building expansion and moved out of its leased satellite warehouse space.  The updated facilities and technology upgrade includes  
  
    20 

     Table of Contents  

a new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system coupled with a new warehouse management system to support our increased level of shipments and a new call center facility to better serve our customers.  The new sortation and warehouse management system were phased into production through the first half of fiscal 2016.  Total cost of the physical building expansion, new sortation equipment and call center facility was approximately   $25 million   and was financed with our expanded PNC revolving line of credit and a   $15 million   PNC term loan.  
  As a result of our distribution facility expansion, consolidation and technology upgrade initiative, the Company incurred approximately   $150,000   and   $530,000   in incremental expenses during the three and   nine   month periods ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, relating primarily to increased labor and training costs associated with the Company s warehouse management system migration.  
  For the three and   nine   month periods ending   October 31, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $294,000   and   $1,266,000  , respectively, primarily related to increased labor, inventory and other warehousing transportation costs, training costs and increased equipment rental costs associated with: the move into the new expanded warehouse building, the move out of previously leased warehouse space and the preparation of the Company s expanded facility for the new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system and upgraded warehouse management system.

  On February 8, 2016, the Company announced the resignation of two executive officers, namely its Chief Executive Officer, and its Executive Vice President - Chief Strategy Officer   Interim General Counsel.  In addition, on March 23, 2016, the Company also announced additional actions taken to reduce corporate overhead and other operating costs.

In conjunction with the employment agreement, the Company granted Mr. Rosenblatt an award of restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units and incentive stock options under the Company's 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan with an aggregate fair value of   $1.8 million  .

  Overview 
  Our Company    
  We are a digital commerce company that offers a mix of proprietary, exclusive and name brands directly to consumers in an engaging and informative shopping experience through TV, online and mobile devices.  We operate a 24-hour television shopping network, EVINE, which is distributed primarily on cable and satellite systems, through which we offer proprietary, exclusive and name brand merchandise in the categories of jewelry   watches; home   consumer electronics; beauty; and fashion   accessories. We also operate evine.com, a comprehensive digital commerce platform that sells products which appear on our television shopping network as well as an extended assortment of online-only merchandise.  Our programming and products are also marketed via mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, and through the leading social media channels. 
  Our investor relations website address is evine.com/ir.  Our goal is to maintain the investor relations website as a way for investors to find information about us easily, including press releases, announcements of investor conferences, investor and analyst presentations and corporate governance.  We also make available free of charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and all amendments to these filings as soon as practicable after that material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.   
       Corporate Name and Branding 
  On November 18, 2014, we announced that we had changed our corporate name to EVINE Live Inc. from ValueVision Media, Inc. Effective November 20, 2014, our NASDAQ trading symbol also changed to EVLV from VVTV. We transitioned from doing business as "ShopHQ" to "EVINE Live" and evine.com on February 14, 2015.  
  Products and Customers 
  Products sold on our media channel platforms include jewelry   watches, home   consumer electronics, beauty, and fashion   accessories.  Historically jewelry   watches has been our largest merchandise category.  While changes in our product mix have occurred as a result of customer demand and other factors including our efforts to diversify our offerings within our major merchandise categories, jewelry   watches remained our largest merchandise category in the first   nine months   of   fiscal 2016  .  We are focused on diversifying our merchandise assortment both among our existing product categories as well as with potentially new product categories, including proprietary, exclusive and name brands, in an effort to increase revenues and to grow our new and active customer base.  The following table shows our merchandise mix as a percentage of our digital commerce net sales for the three month and   nine   month periods indicated by product category group.  
  
    22 

     Table of Contents  

Our product strategy is to continue to develop and expand new product offerings across multiple merchandise categories based on customer demand, as well as to offer competitive pricing and special values in order to drive new customers and maximize margin dollars per minute. Our digital commerce customers   those who interact with our network and transact through TV, online and mobile device   are primarily women between the ages of 40 and 70.  We also have a strong presence of male customers of similar age.  We believe our customers make purchases based on our unique products, quality merchandise and value. 
  Company Strategy    
  As a digital commerce company, our strategy includes offering exciting proprietary, exclusive and name brand merchandise using online, mobile, social media and our commerce infrastructure, which includes television access to approximately   86 million   cable and satellite homes in the United States. We believe our greatest growth opportunity lies in leveraging these digital commerce platforms in a way that engages customers far more often than just when they are in the mood to shop. 
  By investing in new brands and offering a more diverse assortment of proprietary, exclusive (i.e., brands that are not readily available elsewhere) and name brand merchandise, presented in an engaging, entertaining, shopping-centric format, we believe we will attract a larger customer base targeting a broader demographic. At the root of our efforts to attract a larger customer base is a focus on expanding and strengthening our relationships with the brands, personalities and vendors with whom we do business. 
  In addition to offering our customers a more diverse assortment of proprietary, exclusive and name brand merchandise, we are focusing on increasing awareness of the Evine brand while at the same time augmenting our distribution footprint, with the goal of expanding our customer base.  Properly executed, we believe these initiatives may provide us a greater opportunity to grow our top and bottom lines in a more meaningful and competitive way. 
  Priorities for   fiscal 2016   that we believe will ultimately drive sustainable profitability are: improving our discipline around offering the most popular and profitable merchandise mix that our customers prefer; careful attention to gross profit and our cost structure; capitalizing on our expertise in video-based ecommerce; sensibly broadening our distribution base; improving channel adjacencies and placement; exploiting new technologies in mobile and logistics; increasing customer penetration, improving customer and partner relationship management; process improvements; brand building and delivering value to our customers and business partners.  We believe that our new brand identity coupled with a fresh focus on existing as well as emerging platforms and technologies and the development of proprietary and exclusive brands along with an improved program distribution footprint will begin repositioning our Company as a digital commerce company that delivers a more engaging and enjoyable customer experience with sales and service that exceed expectations. 
   
  Our Competition 
  The digital commerce retail business is highly competitive and we are in direct competition with numerous retailers, including online retailers, many of whom are larger, better financed and have a broader customer base than we do.  In our digital commerce operations, we compete for customers with other television shopping and e-commerce retailers, infomercial companies, other types of consumer retail businesses, including traditional "brick and mortar" department stores, discount stores, warehouse stores and specialty stores; catalog and mail order retailers and other direct sellers. 
   Our direct competitors within the television shopping industry include QVC (owned by Liberty Interactive Corporation), and HSN, Inc. (in whom Liberty Interactive Corporation also has a substantial interest, according to public filings), both of whom are substantially larger than we are in terms of annual revenues and customers, and whose programming is carried more broadly to U.S. households, including High Definition bands and multi-channel carriage, than our programming.  Multimedia Commerce Group, Inc., which operates Jewelry Television, also competes with us for customers in the jewelry category. Furthermore, on March 8, 2016, Amazon announced the premiere of a live television program,   Style Code Live  , which features products that viewers can order online.  This program, and any additional similar programs that Amazon may offer in the future, may compete with us.  In addition, there are a number of smaller niche players and startups in the television shopping arena who compete with us.  We  
  
    23 

     Table of Contents  

believe that our major competitors incur cable and satellite distribution fees representing a significantly lower percentage of their sales attributable to their television programming than we do, and that their fee arrangements are substantially on a commission basis (in some cases with minimum guarantees) rather than on the predominantly fixed-cost basis that we currently have.  At our current sales level, our distribution costs as a percentage of total consolidated net sales are higher than those of our competition.  However, one of our strategies is to maintain our fixed distribution cost structure in order to leverage our profitability. 
  We anticipate continued competition for viewers and customers, for experienced television shopping and e-commerce personnel, for distribution agreements with cable and satellite systems and for vendors and suppliers - not only from television shopping companies, but also from other companies that seek to enter the television shopping and online retail industries, including telecommunications and cable companies, television networks, and other established retailers. We believe that our ability to be successful in the digital commerce industry will be dependent on a number of key factors, including continuing to expand our digital footprint to meet our customers' "watch and shop anytime, anywhere" needs, increasing the number of customers who purchase products from us and increasing the dollar value of sales per customer from our existing customer base.

  Private Placement Securities Purchase Agreements 
  On September 14, 2016, we entered into private placement securities purchase agreements with certain accredited investors to which we: (a) sold, in the aggregate,   5,952,381   shares of our common stock at a price of   $1.68   per share; (b) issued five-year warrants ("Warrants") to purchase   2,976,190   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $2.90   per share, and (c) issued an option by which certain investors may purchase additional shares of our common stock and additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock ("Options").   
  We received gross proceeds of   $10.0 million   and incurred approximately   $868,000   of issuance costs.  The Warrants will expire on   September 19, 2021   and are not exercisable until   March 19, 2017  .  The term of each option is   six months   and expire on March 19, 2017, provided, however, that an option may not be exercised for the first   30 days   following issuance. Each option may only be exercised once, in whole or in part, and the future potential investment offering will have a price equal to the   five  -day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock as of the day immediately prior to exercise.  Upon exercise of the Options, two-thirds of the option securities will be issued in the form of common stock, and one-third will be issued in the form of warrants ("Option Warrants"). These Option Warrants will have an exercise price at a   50%   premium to our closing stock price one-day prior to the option exercise and will expire   five years   after issuance.  If all of the Warrants, Options and Option Warrants issued by us are all exercised, the total shares of common stock issued in connection with this offering cannot be more than approximately 19.99% of our total issued and outstanding shares following such exercises.

GACP Credit Agreement   PNC Credit Facility Amendment 
  On March 10, 2016, we entered into a five-year term loan credit and security agreement (as amended on November 7, 2016, the "GACP Credit Agreement") with GACP Finance Co., LLC ("GACP") for a term loan of   $17 million  .  Proceeds from the term loan under the GACP Credit Agreement (the "GACP Term Loan") are being used to provide for working capital and for general corporate purposes of the Company.  The GACP Credit Agreement matures on March 9, 2021. The GACP Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate based on the greater of LIBOR for interest periods of one, two or three months or   1%   plus a margin of   11.0%  .  On the same day, we entered into the sixth amendment to the PNC Credit Facility authorizing the Company to enter into the GACP Credit Agreement. 
  Executive and Management Transition Costs 
  On February 8, 2016, we announced the resignation and departure of two executive officers, namely our Chief Executive Officer, and our Executive Vice President - Chief Strategy Officer   Interim General Counsel.  In addition, on March 23, 2016, we also announced additional actions taken to reduce overhead and other operating costs.  On August 18, 2016, we announced that Bob Rosenblatt, was appointed permanent Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately and entered into an executive employment agreement with Mr. Rosenblatt.  In conjunction with these executive changes as well as other executive and management terminations made during the first   nine   months of fiscal 2016, we recorded charges to income totaling   $568,000   and   $4.4 million   for the three and   nine  -months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, which relate primarily to severance payments to be made as a result of the executive officer terminations and other direct costs associated with our 2016 executive and management transition.  
  On March 26, 2015, we announced the termination and departure of three executive officers, namely our Chief Financial Officer, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and President.  In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we also announced the hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer and a new Chief Merchandising Officer.  In conjunction with these executive changes as well as other management terminations made during the first   nine   months of fiscal 2015, we recorded charges to income of   $754,000   and   $3.5 million   for the three and   nine  -months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively, which related primarily to severance payments to be made as a result of the executive officer resignations and management terminations and other direct costs associated with our 2015 executive and management transition.    
  Distribution Facility Expansion, Consolidation and Technology Upgrade Costs  
  During fiscal 2014, we began a significant operational expansion initiative with respect to overall warehousing capacity and new equipment and system technology upgrades at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution facility.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the new building was substantially completed and we expanded our   262,000   square foot facility to an approximately   600,000   square foot facility.  Subsequently, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we finished the building expansion and moved out of our expired leased satellite warehouse space.  The updated facilities and technology upgrade includes a new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system coupled with a new warehouse management system to support our increased level of shipments and a new call center facility to better serve our customers.  The new sortation and warehouse management systems were phased into production through the first half of fiscal 2016.  The total cost of the physical building expansion, new sortation equipment and call center facility was approximately   $25 million   and was financed with our expanded PNC revolving line of credit and a   $15 million   PNC term loan.  
  As a result of our distribution facility expansion, consolidation and technology upgrade initiative, we incurred approximately   $150,000   and   $530,000   in incremental expenses during the three and   nine   month periods ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, relating primarily to increased labor and training costs associated with our warehouse management system migration.  
  For the three and   nine   month periods ending   October 31, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $294,000   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, primarily related to increased labor, inventory and other warehousing transportation costs, training costs and increased equipment rental costs associated with: the move into the new expanded warehouse building, the move out of previously leased warehouse space and the preparation of our expanded facility for the new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system and upgraded warehouse management system.

(a) Online net sales percentage is calculated based on net sales that are generated from our evine.com website and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online. 

Program Distribution 
  Our 24-hour television shopping networks, EVINE and EVINE Too, which are distributed primarily on cable and satellite systems, reached more than 87 million homes, or full time equivalent subscribers, during the three and   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  Our television home shopping programming is also simulcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on our online website, evine.com, broadcast over-the-air in certain markets and is also available on all mobile channels and on various video streaming applications, such as Roku and Apple TV.  This multi-platform distribution approach, complimented by our strong mobile and online efforts, will ensure that EVINE is available wherever and whenever our customers choose to shop. 
  In addition to our total homes reached, we continue to increase the number of channels on existing distribution platforms, alternative distribution methods and part-time carriage in strategic markets.  We believe that our distribution strategy of pursuing additional channels in productive homes we are already in is a more balanced approach to growing our business than merely adding

new television homes in untested areas.  We are also investing in high definition ("HD") equipment and have made low-cost infrastructure investments that have enabled us to launch an up-converted version of our digital signal in a HD format and that improved the appearance of our primary network feed. We believe that having an HD feed of our service allows us to attract new viewers and customers. 
  Cable and Satellite Distribution Agreements 
  We have entered into distribution agreements with cable operators, direct-to-home satellite providers and telecommunications companies to distribute our television network over their systems. The terms of the affiliation agreements typically range from   one   to   five   years. During the fiscal year, certain agreements with cable, satellite or other distributors may expire. Under certain circumstances, the cable operators or we may cancel the agreements prior to their expiration.  Additionally, we may elect not to renew distribution agreements whose terms result in sub-standard or negative contribution margins.  If the operator drops our service or if either we or the operator fails to reach mutually agreeable business terms concerning the distribution of our service so that the agreements are terminated, our business may be materially adversely affected. Failure to maintain our distribution agreements covering a material portion of our existing households on acceptable financial and other terms could materially and adversely affect our future growth, sales revenues and earnings unless we are able to arrange for alternative means of broadly distributing our television programming. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we believe the direct ownership of NBCU (which is indirectly owned by Comcast) in the Company consisted of   7,141,849   shares of common stock.  We has a significant cable distribution agreement with Comcast and believe that the terms of this agreement are comparable to those with other cable system operators.  
   
  Net Shipped Units 
  The number of net shipped units (shipped units less units returned) during the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter   decrease  d   1%   from the prior year comparable quarter to approximately   2.3 million  . We believe the   decrease   in net shipped units during the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   was driven primarily by a   6.5%     decrease   in consolidated net sales (as discussed below), partially offset by a decline in our average selling price (as discussed below).  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , net shipped units   increase  d   3%   from the prior year's comparable period to   7.1 million   from   6.9 million  .  We believe the   increase   in net shipped units during the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   reflects the continued broadening of our merchandising assortment, a decline in our average selling price (as discussed below) and strong performance in our fashion   accessories and beauty product categories.  
  Average Selling Price 
  The average selling price ("ASP") per net unit was   $60   in the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter, an   8%     decrease   from the prior year quarter.  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , the ASP was   $59  , a   6%     decrease   from the prior year's comparable period.  The   decrease   in the ASP was primarily driven by sales mix into fashion   accessories and beauty product categories, which typically have lower average selling prices, and out of our home   consumer electronics product category as well as broad based ASP decreases within most product categories.  These ASP decreases contributed to our increase in net shipped units by   3%   for the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016  .  Decreasing our ASP has been a key component in our customer acquisition efforts.  We are, however, planning to adjust our merchandising mix to achieve a more ideal balance between ASP and gross margin productivity. 
  Return Rates 
  For the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , our return rate was   20.5%   compared to   18.9%   for the comparable prior year quarter, a   160   basis point   increase  .  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , our return rate was   19.8%   compared to   20.2%   for the prior year comparable period, a   40   basis point   decrease  .  The increase in the return rate for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   was driven primarily by a sales mix out of the home   consumer electronics category into our jewelry   watch category, partially offset by rate improvements in our fashion   accessories and home   consumer electronics categories.  The decrease in the return rate for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   was driven primarily by rate improvements in our fashion   accessories, beauty and home   consumer electronics categories.  We believe that the decreases in the category return rates were driven by the decreases in ASP as described above, improved quality of merchandise and improvements in the execution of our returns policy.  We continue to monitor our return rates in an effort to keep our overall return rates commensurate with our current product mix and our average selling price levels.

Total Customers  
  Total customers who have purchased over the last twelve months   decrease  d   1%   over prior year to approximately   1.4 million  .  The slight   decrease   was driven by a reduction in new customers over the prior year, partially offset by growth in our beauty and fashion   accessories product categories, as well as increases achieved in our customer retention.   
  Net Sales  
  Consolidated net sales for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter were approximately   $151.6 million   as compared with   $162.3 million   for the comparable prior year quarter, a   7%     decrease  .  Consolidated net sales for the first   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   were approximately   $475.7 million   as compared with   $481.8 million   for the comparable prior year period, a   1%     decrease  .  The   decrease   in quarterly and year-to-date consolidated net sales was driven primarily by decreases in our consumer electronics product category as we continue to shift our airtime and product mix from home   consumer electronics to our other higher margin product categories.  The home   consumer electronics decrease was partially offset by growth in our jewelry   watches category during the third quarter and growth in our fashion   accessories and beauty categories on a year-to date basis.  In addition, we also experienced an increase in shipping and handling revenue in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 as a result of more disciplined shipping promotions during the year.  Our online sales penetration, that is, the percentage of net sales that are generated from our evine.com website and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online, was   49.0%   and   48.6%   compared to   46.0%   and   45.7%  , respectively, for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   compared to   fiscal 2015  .  Overall, we continue to deliver strong online sales penetration.  We believe the increase in penetration during the period was driven by our recent digital marketing initiatives and the strong performance of online promotions. Our mobile penetration increased to   45.9%   and   45.5%   of total online orders in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016  , respectively, versus   41.8%   and   41.3%   of total online orders for the comparable prior year periods. 
  Gross Profit  
  Gross profit for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter and   fiscal 2015     third   quarter was approximately   $55.4 million   and   $55.9 million  , respectively, a   decrease   of   $0.5 million  , or   1%  .  Gross profit for the first   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $176.7 million  , an   increase   of   $4.6 million   or   2.7%  , from   $172.1 million   for the comparable prior year period.  The   decrease   in gross profits experienced during the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   was primarily driven by a   6.5%     decrease   in consolidated net sales (as discussed above), partially offset by higher gross margin percentages experienced. Gross margin percentages for the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   were   36.6%   compared to   34.5%   for the comparable prior year period, a   210   basis point   increase  . The   increase   in gross margin percentages reflects a shift in product mix into fashion   accessories, and beauty, which have higher margin percentages.  Gross margin percentages have also   increase  d as a result of higher shipping and handling margins achieved during the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   as a result of more disciplined shipping promotions.  The increase in gross profits experienced during the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   was primarily driven by higher gross margin percentages experienced. Gross margin percentages for the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   were   37.1%  , compared to   35.7%   for the comparable prior year period, a   140   basis point   increase  .  The   increase   in gross margin percentages reflects increased margins due to a shift in product mix into fashion   accessories, and beauty, which have higher margin percentages.  Gross margin percentages have also   increase  d as a result of higher shipping and handling margins achieved during the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   as a result of more disciplined shipping promotions. 
   
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter were approximately   $57.5 million   compared to   $60.2 million   for the comparable prior year period, a   decrease   of   4%  .  Total operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   were flat at approximately   $182.5 million   compared to   $182.5 million   for the comparable prior year period.  Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were   38.0%   and   38.3%  , compared to   37.1%   and   37.9%  , during the   third   quarters and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , respectively.  Total operating expenses for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter includes executive and management transition costs of   $568,000   and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $150,000  , while total operating expenses for the   fiscal 2015     third   quarter includes executive and management transition costs of   $754,000   and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $294,000  .  Total operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   includes executive and management transition costs of   $4.4 million   and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $530,000  , while total operating expenses for the first   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   includes executive and management transition costs of   $3.5 million   and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $1.3 million  .  Excluding executive and management transition costs and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs, total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were   37.5%   and   37.3%  , compared to   36.5%   and   36.9%   for the   third   quarters and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   and   fiscal 2015  , respectively.  
  Distribution and selling expense   decrease  d   $1.9 million  , or   3.7%  , to   $49.2 million  , or   32.4%   of net sales during the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter compared to   $51.0 million  , or   31.4%   of net sales for the comparable prior year fiscal quarter.  Distribution and

selling expense   decrease  d during the quarter due in part to decreased program distribution expense of   $1.2 million   relating to contract negotiations, partially offset by the launch of EVINE Too and broadened HD carriage. The decrease over the prior year quarter was also due to decreased accrued incentive compensation of   $1.3 million   and decreased salaries and benefits of   $522,000  , partially offset by an increase in variable costs of   $1.3 million  . The increase in variable costs was primarily driven by increased customer services telecommunications service expense of   $244,000  , increased variable fulfillment and customer service salaries and wages of   $604,000   and increased variable credit card processing fees and credit expenses of   $539,000  .  Total variable expenses during the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   were approximately   10.6%   of total net sales versus   9.1%   of total net sales for the prior year comparable period.  The   increase   in variable expenses as a percentage of net sales during the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   was primarily due to a   1%     decrease   in net shipped units compared with a   7%     decrease   in consolidated net sales and the 8% decline in our average selling price during the quarter.    
  Distribution and selling expense increased   $1.0 million  , or   1%  , to   $154.2 million  , or   32.4%   of net sales during the   nine   months ended October 29, 2016 compared to   $153.2 million  , or   31.8%   of net sales for the comparable prior year period.  The change in distribution and selling expense during the first   nine   months was due in part to decreased program distribution expense of   $170,000   relating to contract negotiations, partially offset by the launch of EVINE Too and broadened HD carriage. The increase over the prior year period was also driven by an increase in variable costs of   $2.3 million  , increased accrued incentive compensation of   $356,000   and increased online selling and search fees of   $399,000  , partially offset by decreased salaries and benefits of   $1.3 million  , decreased share-based compensation expense of   $341,000   and decreased rebranding expense of   $260,000  .  The increase in variable costs was primarily driven by increased variable fulfillment and customer service salaries and wages of   $2.3 million   and increased variable credit card processing fees and credit expenses of   $1.2 million  , partially offset by decreased customer services telecommunications service expense of   $921,000   and decreased Bowling Green rent expense of   $305,000  .  Total variable expenses during the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   were approximately   10.0%   of total net sales versus   9.4%   of total net sales for the prior year comparable period.  The increase in variable expenses as a percentage of net sales during the first   nine   months of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a   3%   increase in net shipped units compared with a   1%   decrease in consolidated net sales and the 6% decline in our average selling price during the first   nine   months.   
   To the extent that our average selling price continues to decline, our variable expense as a percentage of net sales could continue to increase as the number of our shipped units increase.  Program distribution expense is primarily a fixed cost per household, however, this expense may be impacted by growth in the number of average homes or channels reached or by rate changes associated with improvements in our channel position. 
  General and administrative expense for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter decreased   $285,000  , or   5%   to approximately   $5.7 million   or   3.8%   of net sales, compared to   $6.0 million   or   3.7%   of net sales for the comparable prior year fiscal quarter.  General and administrative expense decreased during the   third   quarter primarily driven by decreased accrued incentive compensation of $580,000, partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of $174,000 and increased equipment   occupancy expense of $95,000. For the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016  , general and administrative expense decreased   $741,000  , or   4%   to approximately   $17.3 million   or   3.6%   of net sales, compared to   $18.1 million   or   3.8%   of net sales for the comparable prior year fiscal period.  For the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016  , general and administrative expense decreased primarily as a result of decreased share-based compensation expense of   $365,000  , a decrease in costs incurred for the implementation of our Shareholder Rights Plan of   $446,000   and decreased rebranding expense of   $115,000  , partially offset by an increase in salary and accrued incentive compensation of   $187,000  .  
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter was approximately   $1.9 million   compared to   $2.1 million   for the comparable prior year period, representing a decrease of   $190,000   or   9%  .  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales for both three-month periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   1.3%  .  The decrease in the quarterly depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decreased depreciation expense of   $190,000   as a result of a reduction in our non-fulfillment depreciable asset base year over year.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $6.0 million   compared to   $6.4 million   for the comparable prior year period, representing a   decrease   of   $344,000   or   5%  .  Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales for both   nine   month periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   1.3%  .  The marginal decrease in the year to date depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decreased depreciation expense of   $363,000   as a result of a reduction in our non-fulfillment depreciable asset base year over year, partially offset by increased amortization expense related to the trademark and brand name intangible asset, "EVINE", of   $18,000  . 
   
  Operating Loss 
  For the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter, we reported an operating loss of approximately   $2.1 million   compared to an operating loss of   $4.3 million   for the   fiscal 2015     third   quarter, representing a decrease of   $2.2 million  .  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   we reported an operating loss of   $5.8 million   compared to an operating loss of   $10.4 million   for the comparable prior year period, representing a decrease of   $4.6 million  .  For the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016  , our operating loss improved primarily as a result of decreases in distribution and selling, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization,  executive and management

transition costs and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit (as noted above).  For the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016  , our operating loss improved primarily as a result of increased gross profit and decreases in general and administrative, depreciation and amortization and distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs, partially offset by increases in distribution and selling and executive and management transition costs (as noted above).  
  Net Loss 
  For the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter, we reported a net loss of approximately   $3.9 million   or   $0.06   per share on   60,513,215   weighted average basic common shares outstanding compared with a net loss of   $5.2 million   or   $0.09   per share on   57,125,435   weighted average basic common shares outstanding in the   fiscal 2015     third   quarter.  For the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016  , we reported a net loss of approximately   $10.8 million   or   $0.19   per share on   58,317,681   weighted average basic common shares outstanding compared with a net loss of   $13.0 million   or   $0.23   per share on   56,952,952   weighted average basic common shares outstanding in the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2015  .  Net loss for the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2016   includes executive and management transition costs of   $568,000  , distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $150,000  , and interest expense of   $1.6 million  . Net loss for the   third   quarter of   fiscal 2015   includes executive and management transition costs of   $754,000  , distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $294,000   and interest expense of   $690,000  . 
  Net loss for the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016   includes executive and management transition costs of   $4.4 million  , distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $530,000   and interest expense of   $4.4 million  .  Net loss for the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2015   includes executive and management transition costs of   $3.5 million  , distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs of   $1.3 million   and interest expense of   $2.0 million  . 
  For the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016  , net loss reflects an income tax provision of   $205,000   and   $615,000  , respectively.  The   fiscal 2016     third   quarter and year-to-date tax provision included a non-cash expense charge of approximately   $197,000   and   $592,000  , respectively, relating to changes in our long-term deferred tax liability related to the tax amortization of our indefinite-lived intangible FCC license asset that is not available to offset existing deferred tax assets in determining changes to our income tax valuation allowance.  As we continue to amortize the carrying value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset for tax purposes, we expect to record additional non-cash income tax expense of approximately   $197,000   over the remainder of   fiscal 2016  . 
   For the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   fiscal 2015  , net loss reflects an income tax provision of   $205,000   and   $615,000  , respectively, which included a non-cash expense charge of   $197,000   and   $591,000  , respectively, relating to changes in our long-term deferred tax liability related to the tax amortization of our indefinite-lived intangible FCC license asset as discussed above. 
  We have not recorded any income tax benefit on previously recorded net losses due to the uncertainty of realizing income tax benefits in the future as indicated by our recording of an income tax valuation allowance. Based on our recent history of losses, a full valuation allowance has been recorded and was calculated in accordance with GAAP, which places primary importance on our most recent operating results when assessing the need for a valuation allowance.  We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, including those related to net operating loss carry-forwards, until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in the future.   
   
  Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation 
  Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for the   fiscal 2016     third   quarter was   $2.5 million   compared with Adjusted EBITDA of   $169,000   for the   fiscal 2015     third   quarter.  For the   nine  -months ended   October 29, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA was   $9.8 million   compared with Adjusted EBITDA of   $4.3 million   for the comparable prior year period.

A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its comparable GAAP measurement, net loss, follows, in thousands: 

(a) EBITDA as defined for this statistical presentation represents net loss for the respective periods excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income (expense) and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-operating gains (losses), executive and management transition costs, distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs, Shareholder Rights Plan costs and non-cash share-based compensation expense. 
  We have included the term "Adjusted EBITDA" in our EBITDA reconciliation in order to adequately assess the operating performance of our television and online businesses and in order to maintain comparability to our analyst s coverage and financial guidance, when given. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time with those of other similar companies. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a metric measure to evaluate operating performance under our management and executive incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity.  Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the same or similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. 
  Seasonality 
  Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with the highest sales activity normally occurring during our fourth fiscal quarter of the year, namely November through January.  Our business is also sensitive to general economic conditions and business conditions affecting consumer spending.  Additionally, our television audience (and therefore sales revenue) can be significantly impacted by major world or domestic events which attract television viewership and divert audience attention away from our programming.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  A discussion of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates and assumptions are discussed in detail in our   fiscal 2015   annual report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had cash of   $39.7 million   and had restricted cash and investments of   $450,000  . Our restricted cash and investments are generally restricted for a period ranging from 30-60 days.  In addition, under the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain a minimum of   $10 million   of unrestricted cash and unused line availability at all times.  As our unused line availability is greater than   $10 million   at   October 29, 2016  , no additional cash is required to be restricted.  As of   January 30, 2016  , we had cash of   $11.9 million   and had restricted cash and investments of   $450,000  .  For the first   nine   months of   fiscal 2016  , working capital increased   $14.5 million   to   $98.2 million  . Our current ratio (our total current assets over total current liabilities) was   1.8   at   October 29, 2016   and   1.7   at   January 30, 2016  . 
  Sources of Liquidity  
  Our principal source of liquidity is our available cash of   $39.7 million   as of   October 29, 2016  , which was held in bank depository accounts primarily for the preservation of cash liquidity. 
  PNC Credit Facility 
  On February 9, 2012, we entered into a credit and security agreement (as amended through September 7, 2016, the "PNC Credit Facility") with PNC Bank, N.A. ("PNC"), a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as lender and agent.  The PNC Credit Facility, which includes The Private Bank as part of the facility, provides a revolving line of credit of   $90.0 million   and provides for a   $15.0 million   term loan on which we have drawn to fund improvements at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  The PNC Credit Facility also provides for an accordion feature that would allow us to expand the size of the revolving line of credit by an additional   $25.0 million   at the discretion of the lenders and upon certain conditions being met.  
  All borrowings under the PNC Credit Facility mature and are payable on May 1, 2020.  Subject to certain conditions, the PNC Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to   $6.0 million   which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the PNC Credit Facility. Maximum borrowings and available capacity under the revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility are equal to the lesser of   $90.0 million   or a calculated borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory.  
   The revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of between 3% and 4.5% based on our trailing twelve-month reported EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) measured quarterly in fiscal 2016 and semi-annually thereafter as demonstrated in our financial statements.  The term loan bears interest at either a LIBOR rate or a base rate plus a margin consisting of between 4% and 5% on base rate loans and 5% to 6% on LIBOR rate loans based on our leverage ratio as demonstrated in our audited financial statements.  
   As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had borrowings of   $59.9 million   under its revolving line of credit.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the term loan under the PNC Credit Facility had   $11.2 million   outstanding and was used to fund our expansion initiative of which   $2.1 million   was classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet.  Remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $16.2 million  , and provides liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes.  In addition, as of   October 29, 2016  , our unrestricted cash plus facility availability was   $55.8 million   and we were in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the PNC Credit Facility and expect to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months. 
  Principal borrowings under the term loan are to be payable in monthly installments over an   84   month amortization period commencing on January 1, 2015 and are also subject to mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, upon receipt of certain proceeds from dispositions of collateral.  Borrowings under the term loan are also subject to mandatory prepayment starting in the current fiscal year ending January 30, 2016 in an amount equal to fifty percent (  50%  ) of excess cash flow for such fiscal year, with any such payment not to exceed   $2.0 million   in any such fiscal year. 
  The PNC Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus facility availability of   $10.0 million   at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures.  Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0, become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus facility availability falls below $18.0 million.  In addition, the PNC Credit Facility places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders. 
  GACP Term Loan 
  On March 10, 2016, we entered into a term loan credit and security agreement (as amended on November 7, 2016, the "GACP Credit Agreement") with GACP Finance Co., LLC ("GACP") for a term loan of $17 million.  Proceeds from the GACP Term Loan will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to help strengthen our total liquidity position.  The term loan  
  
    32 

     Table of Contents  

under the GACP Credit Agreement (the "GACP Term Loan") is secured on a first lien priority basis by the proceeds of any sale of our Boston television station FCC license and on a second lien priority basis by our accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and certain real estate as well as other assets as described in the GACP Credit Agreement.  The GACP Credit Agreement matures on March 9, 2021. The GACP Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a fixed rate based on the greater of LIBOR for interest periods of one, two or three months or 1% plus a margin of 11.0%, or (ii) a daily floating Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 10.0%.  Principal borrowings under the GACP Term Loan are to be payable in consecutive monthly installments of $70,833 each, commencing on April 1, 2016, with a final installment due at the end of the five-year term equal to the aggregate principal amount of all loans outstanding on such date.  The GACP Term Loan is also subject to mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including, but without limitation, from the proceeds of the sale of collateral assets and from 50% of annual excess cash flow as defined in the GACP Credit Agreement.  
  The GACP Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and conditions, which are consistent with the covenants and conditions under the PNC Credit Agreement, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus revolving line of credit availability under the PNC Credit Facility of $10.0 million at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures.  Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the GACP Credit Agreement) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0, become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus revolving line of credit availability under the PNC Credit Facility falls below $18 million.  In addition, the GACP Credit Agreement places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders.  
  Private Placement Securities Purchase Agreements 
  On September 14, 2016, we entered into private placement securities purchase agreements with certain accredited investors to which we: (a) sold, in the aggregate,   5,952,381   shares of our common stock at a price of   $1.68   per share; (b) Warrants to purchase   2,976,190   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $2.90   per share, and (c) issued Options.   
  We received gross proceeds of   $10.0 million   and incurred approximately   $868,000   of issuance costs.  The Warrants will expire on   September 19, 2021   and are not exercisable until   March 19, 2017  .  The term of each option is   six months   and expire on March 19, 2017, provided, however, that an option may not be exercised for the first   30 days   following issuance. Each option may only be exercised once, in whole or in part, and the future potential investment offering will have a price equal to the   five  -day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock as of the day immediately prior to exercise.  Upon exercise of the Options, two-thirds of the option securities will be issued in the form of common stock, and one-third will be issued as Option Warrants. These Option Warrants will have an exercise price at a   50%   premium to our closing stock price one-day prior to the option exercise and will expire   five years   after issuance.  If all of the Warrants, Options and Option Warrants issued by us are all exercised, the total shares of common stock issued in connection with this offering cannot be more than approximately 19.99% of our total issued and outstanding shares following such exercises.  
  On November 10, 2016, two investors exercised their Options.  This exercise resulted in our issuance, in the aggregate, of (a)   667,746   shares of our common stock at a price of   $1.94   per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of   $1.3 million  ; and (b) five-year warrants to purchase an additional   333,873   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $3.00   per share expiring on November 10, 2021.  
  Other 
  Another potential source of near-term liquidity is our ability to increase our cash flow resources by reducing the percentage of our sales offered under our ValuePay installment program or by decreasing the length of time we extend credit to our customers under this installment program.  However, any such change to the terms of our ValuePay installment program could impact future sales, particularly for products sold with higher price points.  Please see "Cash Requirements" below for a discussion of our ValuePay installment program. 
  Cash Requirements 
  Currently, our principal cash requirements are to fund our business operations, which consist primarily of purchasing inventory for resale, funding accounts receivable growth through the use of our ValuePay installment program in support of sales growth, funding our basic operating expenses, particularly our contractual commitments for cable and satellite programming distribution, and the funding of necessary capital expenditures. We closely manage our cash resources and our working capital.  We attempt to manage our inventory receipts and reorders in order to ensure our inventory investment levels remain commensurate with our current sales trends. We also monitor the collection of our credit card and ValuePay installment receivables and manage our vendor payment terms in order to more effectively manage our working capital which includes matching cash receipts from our customers, to the extent possible, with related cash payments to our vendors.  Our ValuePay installment program entitles customers to purchase  
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  

merchandise and generally make payments in two or more equal monthly credit card installments. ValuePay remains a cost effective promotional tool for us. We continue to make strategic use of our ValuePay program in an effort to increase sales and to respond to similar competitive programs.   
  During fiscal 2014, we began a significant operational expansion initiative with respect to overall warehousing capacity and new equipment and system technology upgrades at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution facility.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the new building was substantially completed and we expanded our   262,000   square foot facility to an approximately   600,000   square foot facility.  Subsequently, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed the building expansion and moved out of our expired leased satellite warehouse space.  The updated facilities and technology upgrade includes a new high-speed parcel shipping and item sortation system coupled with a new warehouse management system to support our increased level of shipments and a new call center facility to better serve our customers.  The new sortation and warehouse management system were phased into production through the first half of fiscal 2016.  The total cost of the physical building expansion, new sortation equipment and call center facility was approximately   $25 million   and was financed with our expanded PNC revolving line of credit and a   $15 million   PNC term loan.   
  We also have significant future commitments for our cash, primarily payments for cable and satellite program distribution obligations and the eventual repayment of our credit facilities. We believe that our existing cash balances will be sufficient to maintain liquidity to fund our normal business operations over the next twelve months. As of January 30, 2016 we had contractual cash obligations and commitments, primarily with respect to our cable and satellite agreements and payments required under our PNC Credit Facility and operating leases, totaling approximately $330.0 million over the next five fiscal years. 
  For the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately   $12.3 million   compared to net cash used for operating activities of approximately   $9.1 million   for the comparable   fiscal 2015   period.  Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities for the   fiscal 2016 and 2015   periods reflects net loss, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based payment compensation, deferred taxes and the amortization of deferred revenue and deferred financing costs.  In addition, net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016   reflects a decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses; and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventory. 
  Accounts receivable decreased as a result of collections made on outstanding receivables balances resulting from our seasonal high fourth quarter.  Inventories increased as a result of planned purchases in support of our fourth quarter anticipated sales levels.  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased during the first   nine months   of   fiscal 2016   primarily driven by an increase in accrued cable distribution fees, partially offset by a decrease in the returns reserve at   October 29, 2016   as a result of our lower return rate, timing of accrued salaries, a decrease in accrued inventory due timing of payments made to vendors and a decrease in accrued employee benefit contributions.  
  Net cash used for investing activities totaled approximately   $7.3 million   for the first   nine months   of   fiscal 2016   compared to net cash used for investing activities of   $16.2 million   for the comparable   fiscal 2015   period.  For the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , expenditures for property and equipment were approximately   $7.3 million   and   $17.9 million  , respectively.  The decrease in the capital expenditures from   fiscal 2015   to   fiscal 2016   primarily relates to expenditures totaling   $7.5 million   made during the first   nine months   of   fiscal 2015   in connection with our distribution facility expansion. Additional capital expenditures made during the periods presented relate primarily to expenditures made for the development, upgrade and replacement of computer software, order management, merchandising and warehouse management systems, related computer equipment, digital broadcasting equipment and other office equipment, warehouse equipment and production equipment.  Principal future capital expenditures are expected to include: the development, upgrade and replacement of various enterprise software systems; equipment improvements and technology upgrades at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky; security upgrades to our information technology; the upgrade and digitalization of television production and transmission equipment; and related computer equipment associated with the expansion of our television shopping business and digital commerce initiatives.  
  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately   $22.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 29, 2016   and related primarily to proceeds from the GACP term loan of   $17.0 million   and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of   $10.0 million  , partially offset by principal payments on the term loans of   $2.1 million  , payments for deferred financing costs of   $1.4 million  , payments for common stock issuance costs of   $585,000  , capital lease payments of   $39,000   and payments for restricted stock issuance of   $13,000  .  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $17.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 31, 2015   and related primarily to proceeds from the revolving loan under the PNC Credit Facility of   $14.3 million  , proceeds from the term loan under the PNC Credit Facility of   $2.8 million   and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of   $2.5 million  , partially offset by payments on the term loan of   $1.5 million  , payments for deferred financing costs of   $428,000   and capital lease payments of   $39,000  .

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments as a hedge to offset market risk. Our operations are conducted primarily in the United States and are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Some of our products are sourced internationally and may fluctuate in cost as a result of foreign currency swings; however, we believe these fluctuations have not been significant. Our credit facilities have exposure to interest rate risk; changes in market interest rates could impact the level of interest expense and income earned on our cash portfolio. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  We are involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the claims and suits individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operations or consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  See Part I. Item 1A., "Risk Factors," of EVINE Live Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  , for a detailed discussion of the risk factors affecting the Company. There have been no material changes from the risk factors described in the annual report with the exception of the item noted below. 
  We may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by products sold by us, or we may be subject to voluntary or involuntary product recalls. 
  Products sold by us may expose us to product liability or product safety claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls, which could involve significant expense incurred by the Company. We maintain, and have generally required the manufacturers and vendors of these products to carry, product liability and errors and omissions insurance. There can be no assurance that we will maintain this coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms, or that this insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims or even be available with respect to any particular claim. There also can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to maintain this insurance or that this coverage will be adequate or available with respect to any particular claims. We also require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such claims.  Product liability claims could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance. 
  We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or we may voluntarily conduct a product recall. The costs associated with product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year, or for any particular recall event, could be significant. Although we require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such events, an involuntary product recall could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.
