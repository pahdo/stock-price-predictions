      Table of Contents           CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Stony Hill Corp., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ), contains  forward-looking statements,  as defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  will ,  should ,  could ,  expects ,  plans ,  intends ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,  potential  or  continue  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology.  These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan, and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within which we operate could materially affect our actual results. Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking statements and/or predictions include, among other things: our ability to effectively integrate the business of Stony Hill Ventures Corp. into our operations, the possibility that we will not receive sufficient customers to grow our business, the Company s need for and ability to obtain additional financing, other factors over which we have little or no control; and other factors discussed in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).     Our management has included projections and estimates in this Form 10-Q, which are based primarily on management s experience in the industry, assessments of our results of operations, discussions and negotiations with third parties and a review of information filed by our competitors with the SEC or otherwise publicly available.  We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.  We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.                  3

      Table of Contents                  STONY HILL CORP. (formerly First Fixtures Inc.)     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016                 NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION      Stony Hill Corp. (formerly First Fixtures, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on February 21, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective October 24, 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp. The Company is organized to sell plumbing fixtures over the internet.      Basis of presentation   Unaudited Financial Statements      The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.      Going concern      To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $57,955. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $49,865. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.      NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Use of Estimates and Assumptions      Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.                  8       
      Table of Contents                    STONY HILL CORP. (formerly First Fixtures Inc.)    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016                   NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)         Cash and Cash Equivalents      For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Financial Instruments      The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term maturities.      Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share      The basic loss per share are calculated by dividing the Company s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted loss per share are the same as basic loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.      Income Taxes      The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.       Stock-based Compensation      The Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      The Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.                 9       
      Table of Contents                    STONY HILL CORP. (formerly First Fixtures Inc.)    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016                 NOTE 3   COMMON STOCK      On February 28, 2014, the Company issued 259,000,000 common shares to the sole director and President of the Company for cash proceeds of $5,000.     On April 5, 2015, the Company issued 4,001,757 shares of its common stock for $3,090 in cash.      On April 23, 2015 the directors of the Company increased its Share Capital from 75,000,000 authorized common shares to 200,000,000 authorized common shares with the same par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.     On April 23, 2015, the directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake a forward split of the common stock of the Company on a basis of 518 new common shares for 1 old common share. All references in these financial statements to number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding prior to the 518:1 forward split have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis, unless otherwise noted.     On April 24, 2015, the founding shareholder of the Company returned 252,997,416 restricted shares of common stock to treasury and the shares were subsequently cancelled by the Company.      Subsequent to the period ending September 30, 2016 on October 3, 2016, the directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake a reverse split of the common stock of the company on a basis of 1 new common shares for 10 old common shares. The effective date of the reverse split was October 24, 2016. All references in these financial statements to number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding prior to the 1-for-10 reverse split have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis, unless otherwise noted.      NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      At September 30, 2016, the Company owed $49,524 (March 31, 2016; $40,774) to its Chief Executive Officer. During the period ended September 30, 2016 the CEO paid expenses of $8,750 on behalf of the Company. During the period ended September 30, 2015, the CEO advanced $8,552 to the Company. All amounts due to the related party are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are due on demand.      NOTE 5   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Subsequent to the period ending September 30, 2016 on October 3, 2016, the directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake a reverse split of the common stock of the company on a basis of 1 new common shares for 10 old common shares. The effective date of the reverse split was October 24, 2016. All references in these financial statements to number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding prior to the 1-for-10 reverse split have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis, unless otherwise noted.     On November 4, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Stony Hills Venture Corp. This transaction will be accounted for as a reverse merger.               Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       This section of this Form 10-Q includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.      Results of Operations      For the three month period ended September 30, 2016 we had no revenue. Expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $4,382 resulting in a net loss of $4,382 compared to expenses totaling $6,404 and a net loss of $6,404 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 is a result of Office and general expense of $4,382 comprised primarily of accounting expense and printing expense. The net loss of $6,404 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 is a result of Office and general expense comprised primarily of accounting expense and printing expense. The reduction in expenses between the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are primarily a result of professional fees being $1,350 lower, bank fees were $200 lower, printing expense was $304 lower and interest expense was $687 lower while transfer agent fees were $519 higher.     For the six month period ended September 30, 2016 we had no revenue. Expenses for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $11,019 resulting in a net loss of $11,019 compared to expenses totaling $15,417 and a net loss of $15,417 for the six month period ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 is a result of Office and general expense of $11,019 comprised primarily of accounting expense and printing expense. The net loss of $15,417 for the six month period ended September 30, 2015 is a result of Office and general expense comprised primarily of accounting expense and printing expense. The reduction in expenses between the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are primarily a result of professional fees being $2,100 lower, bank fees were $280 lower, filing fees were $920 lower, printing expense was $1,102 lower and interest expense was $887 lower while transfer agent fees were $891 higher.      Capital Resources and Liquidity      No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our sole Officer and Director, our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year.     As of September 30, 2016, we had $1,501 in cash as compared to $2,191 in cash at March 31, 2016. The funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the planned operations of the Company and maintain a reporting status. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s sole officer and director, Mr. Povall has loaned the Company $49,524 in the form of a non-secured loan. During the period ended September 30, 2016 the Mr. Povall paid expenses of $8,750 on behalf of the Company. During the period ended September 30, 2015, the Mr. Povall advanced $8,552 to the Company. All amounts due to Mr. Povall are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are due on demand.      We do not anticipate researching and releasing any further features to our software nor do we foresee the purchase or sale of any significant equipment. We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees.            Off-balance sheet arrangements      Other than the situation described in the section titled Capital Recourses and Liquidity, the company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets         Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures       Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      In connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company's management, including our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
