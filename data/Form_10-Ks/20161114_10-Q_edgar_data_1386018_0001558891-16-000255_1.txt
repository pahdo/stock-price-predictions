The
accompanying interim unaudited financial statements of Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) are condensed and,
therefore, do not include all disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s most recent annual financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in a 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ) on April 14, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have
been included in the accompanying interim financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments. The results
of operations presented in the accompanying interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.

NOTE
1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015
audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue
as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital
to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced
to cease operations.  

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan
is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet
its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements included all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
C2R, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, and Jett Rink Oil, LLC, a Kansas Limited Liability Company. All intercompany transactions have
been eliminated.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of the Company s financial statements.
The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the
Company s financial statements.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash in banks and financial instruments which mature within six months of the date of purchase.  

Oil
and Gas Properties   

The
Company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition, exploration
and development costs, including certain payroll, asset retirement costs, other internal costs, and interest incurred for the
purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves, are capitalized. Internal costs that are capitalized are directly attributable
to acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include costs related to production, general corporate overhead
or similar activities. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.
Proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied to reduce the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties
unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain
or loss is recognized.  

Capitalized
costs associated with impaired properties and capitalized costs related to properties having proved reserves, plus the
estimated future development costs, and asset retirement costs under Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 410  Asset Retirement and
Environmental Obligations  (FASB ASC 410), are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved
reserves. Capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and deferred income taxes, are
limited to the total of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at ten percent,
plus the cost of unevaluated properties.  Under certain specific conditions, companies could elect to use
subsequent prices for determining the estimated future net cash flows. The use of subsequent pricing is no longer allowed.
There are many factors, including global events that may influence the production, processing, marketing and price of oil and
natural gas. A reduction in the valuation of oil and natural gas properties resulting from declining prices or production
could adversely impact depletion rates and capitalized cost limitations. Capitalized costs associated with properties that
have not been evaluated through drilling or seismic analysis, including exploration wells in progress at September 30, 2016,
are excluded from the unit-of-production amortization. Exclusions are adjusted annually based on drilling results and
interpretative analysis.

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Oil
and Gas Properties (Continued)   

Sales
of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized,
unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. If it is determined
that the relationship is significantly altered, the corresponding gain or loss will be recognized in the statements of operations.  

Costs
of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company recognized $-0- and $-0-, respectively, of depletion expense related to oil and gas production during the period.  

Ceiling
Test   

In
applying the full cost method, the Company performs an impairment test (ceiling test) at each reporting date, whereby the carrying
value of property and equipment is compared to the value of its proved reserves discounted at a ten percent interest rate of future
net revenues, based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus the lower
of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized, less the income tax effects related to
book and tax basis differences of the properties.    

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenues
from the sale of oil and natural gas are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has
transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.  For oil sales, this occurs when the customer takes delivery of oil
from the operators  storage tanks.  

Loss
per Share   

The
Company has adopted ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company had 1,200,000 potential dilutive
shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016 that were excluded as their effect was anti-dilutive.

4   OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES   

On
April 3, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the first of three wells with Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County,
Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company
capitalized $213,000 of cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.

NOTE
4   OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (CONTINUED)   

On
May 10, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the second of three wells with Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County,
Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company
capitalized $189,000 of cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.  

On
July 23, 2016 the Company received $58,684 from the operator of two of its oil and gas leases. The payment received represented
a partial refund of the Company s previous $404,837 in payments made to the operator pursuant to the terms of an Authorization
for Expenditures ( AFE ) Agreement. The Company s original payments under the AFE were capitalized to oil and
gas properties in 2014. All capitalized costs pursuant to the AFE were fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2015.
As the capitalized costs had been previously impaired, the $58,684 was recorded as a gain on property settlement for the period
ended September 30, 2016.  

Oil
and gas properties are stated at cost. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, oil and gas properties, net consisted
of the following:  

NOTE
5   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE   

On
January 3, 2014, the Company received $600,000 in connection with a convertible note financing commitment, the terms of which
call for the Company to receive three tranches of $200,000 each on a callable convertible note wherein the Company borrows the
sum at five percent interest for one year and the investor can elect to continue to receive the interest on the note or have the
Company issue the investor shares of common stock of the Company at $0.50 per share to retire the debt. The notes came due on
December 12, 2014, and as of September 30, 2016 the notes were in default. At September 30, 2016 accrued interest on the notes
totaled $82,137.  

NOTE
6   NOTES PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY   

On
June 11, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from a related-party entity. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the principal accrues
interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on June 11, 2016. Subsequent to the initial borrowing
the Company borrowed an additional $57,500 from the same lender under the same terms. On July 25, 2016 the Company paid $40,000
against the outstanding principal of the notes. Accrued interest totaling $1,340 was forgiven at the time of payment, and recorded as additional paid-in capital. At September
30, 2016 the total outstanding principal balance due to the lender was $22,500, and aggregate accrued interest on the notes totaled
$182.

NOTE
6   NOTES PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY (CONTINUED)   

On
May 6, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from an unrelated third-party entity. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the principal
accrues interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on May 6, 2016. On July 25, 2015 the note,
inclusive of all unpaid principal and interest, was transferred to and assumed by a related party. On July 25, 2016 the Company
repaid the full $5,000 principal balance due under the terms of the note. Accrued interest on the note totaling $305 was forgiven
at the time of payment, and recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of September 30, 2016 the note principal and interest have
been satisfied in full.  

On
March 7, 2016 the Company borrowed $10,000 from a related-party. Pursuant to the terms of the note the principal accrues interest
at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on May 6, 2017. On May 2, 2016 the Company borrowed an additional
$4,000 under the same terms. At September 30, 2016 the principal balances of the notes totaled $14,000 and accrued interest on
the notes totaled $366.  

NOTE
7   ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS   

The
total future asset retirement obligation is estimated by management based on the Company s net working interests in all
wells and facilities, estimated costs to reclaim and abandon wells and facilities and the estimated timing of the costs to be
incurred in future periods. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company estimated the undiscounted cash flows related
to asset retirement obligation to total approximately $105,500. The actual costs to settle the obligation are expected to occur
in approximately 25 years. Through September 30, 2016, the Company established an asset retirement obligation of $9,860 for the
wells acquired by the Company, which was capitalized to the value of the oil and gas properties. The fair value of the liability
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is estimated to be $12,113 and $11,534, respectively, using a risk free rate of 9.31
percent and inflation rates between 3.87 and 4.81 percent. Total accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation was $579
and $530 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

NOTE
8   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   

The
Company has 1,000,000 preferred shares authorized at a par value of $0.001 and 74,000,000 common shares authorized at par value
of $0.001.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company has 42,013 shares of preferred stock and 42,728,159 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding.    

On
July 29, 2016 the Company repaid in full the principal balance of multiple related-party notes payable. Pursuant to this transaction,
the note holders agreed to forgive an aggregate of $1,645 in accrued interest related to the notes. The Company recorded this
forgiveness as a credit to additional paid-in capital, as the note holders were related parties.  

NOTE
9   RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company owed its Chief Financial Officer $25,000 and $16,000, respectively, in
accrued director fees. An additional $2,000 was owed to the Company s Chief Executive Officer in accrued director fees
and notes payable.

10   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

During
the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company became party to a legal action brought about by an unrelated third-party
individual, wherein the plaintiff alleges the Company  participated and/or conspired in a scheme to disseminate spam
emails  which were misleading in order to encourage individuals to purchase shares of the Company s common stock
at an artificial and/or inflated stock price. As of September 30, 2016, the Company elected to record a contingent liability
in the amount of $11,000 as the likelihood of a negotiated settlement agreement appeared high.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
10Q contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ materially from those discussed
herein. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of
any revisions of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.  

Going
Concern   

The
future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of
products and services through our websites. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public
offering of its common stock, if necessary. Our auditors have included a going concern paragraph in their audit report dated April
13, 2016 included in our annual report on Form 10-K because uncertainties raise doubts about the Issuers ability to continue as
a going concern.  

Corporate
Overview    

Unless
otherwise indicated, in this 10Q, references to  we,   our,   us,  the  Company, 
 TGRO  refer to Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (formerly UTEC, Inc.). Future plans include the exploration,
development and production of oil and gas in the United States. Our current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings
and develop our current oil and gas assets over the next twelve months.  

The
Company through its acquisition of Jett Rink LLC owns interests in two oil and gas wells for approximately 50 acres located in
Creek County, State of Oklahoma, together with any personal property and lease equipment located thereon. These two wells are
shut-in and produce no revenue.  

On
April 9, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our first well on the Cowley County leases. The Company paid
$24,000 for a 30% WI in the Stalnaker lease and agreed to spend $239,000 for our share of drilling costs of the Stalnaker 17-1
well. (paid). The operator intends to frac this well in the late spring of 2015.  

On
May 10, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our second well on the Cowley County leases. The Company holds
a 30% WI in the DeFore lease and agreed to spend $189,000 for our share of drilling costs of the DeFore 19-1 well. (paid). This
well was fracked and is producing oil and revenue to the Company, although due in part to low oil prices the DeFore well did not
produce or earn revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Our
current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings and develop our current oil and gas assets over the next twelve
months.  

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, and 2015    

Revenues   

  Revenues
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $-0-, compared to $1,980 for the comparable period of 2015. This decrease
resulted from a decrease in the oil and gas production from the Company s Defore 19-1 well that commenced during 2015. No
oil and gas was produced during the three months ended September 30, 2016, due in part to low oil prices. As oil prices increase
the Company anticipates increased production and revenues will be derived from the DeFore well.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $58,154 and 8,256, respectively. The majority of these
expenses related to professional fees totaling $29,612 and $3,450, respectively,general and administrative expenses totaling
$16,575 and $4,536, respectively,and judgment expense of $11,000 and $-0- for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Professional fees increased during the current period primarily due to an increase in legal fees relating to legal
defense and subsequent negotiation of a legal settlement. General and administrative expenses increased during the current
period, due primarily to an $11,000 write-down of the Company s DeFore and Stalnaker wells. The Company also recognized
accretion expense of $198 and $181 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as well as lease
operating expenses of $769 and $89 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Other
Income (Expenses)   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense in the amount of $10,575 and $7,688,
respectively. Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in notes payable upon which interest accrues. Additionally,
the Company recorded a gain on property settlement in the amount of $58,684 during the current period, relating to a refund of
funds paid toward oil and gas properties.  

Net
Loss   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a net loss in the amounts of $10,045 and $13,964, respectively.
The slight decrease in net loss was largely the result of the decreased revenues coupled with increased other income, partially
offset by increased operating expenses during the current period.  

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, and 2015    

Revenues   

Revenues
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $-0-, compared to $11,643 for the comparable period of 2015. This decrease
resulted from a decrease in the oil and gas production from the Company s Defore 19-1 well that commenced during 2015. No
oil and gas was produced during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due in part to low oil prices. As oil prices increase
the Company anticipates increased production and revenues will be derived from the DeFore well.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $96,173 and 43,239, respectively. The majority of these
expenses related to general and administrative expenses totaling $30,023 and $21,036, respectively, and legal and professional expenses
totaling $53,802 and $21,147, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Professional fees
increased during the current period primarily due to increased legal fees. General and administrative expenses increased
during the current period, due primarily to an increase in transfer agent fees and to an $11,000 write-down of the
Company s DeFore and Stalnaker wells. The Company also recognized accretion expense of $579 and $530 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as well as lease operating expenses of $769 and $526 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Other
Income (Expenses)   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense in the amount of 26,761 and
$25,903, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the Company amortizing the debt discount of convertible
debt to interest expense during 2015. Additionally, the Company recorded a gain on property settlement in the amount of
$58,684 during the current period, relating to a refund of funds paid toward oil and gas properties.  

Net
Loss   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a net loss in the amounts of $64,250 and $57,499, respectively.
The increased net loss was largely the result of the increased operating expenses, partially offset by increased other income during
the current period.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had $977 in current assets, consisting of $777 in cash, and deposits of $200, compared to $15,247
in current assets at December 31, 2015, which consisted of cash of $15,047 and deposits of $200. Total liabilities at September
30, 2016 totaled $799,047 compared to $750,712 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 the Company had a current ratio of
0.01.  

The
Company estimates that it will require $400,000 to accomplish its short-term goal of bringing shut-in wells back into production
and the company's sole source of liquidity to this point has been through the sale of common stock. Such funding that is required
to maintain liquidity will come in the form of equity sales of common stock.  

Cash
used in operations totaled $69,454 and $26,507 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
increase in cash used in operations results primarily from an increased net loss for the period. Cash provided by investing
activities totaled $58,684 and    $-0-, respectively, and cash provided by (used
in) financing activities totaled $(3,500) and $10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

As
of September 30, 2016 under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a   15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph
(b) of Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.  

The
Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.  

There
was no change in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during our last fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

The
Company has not taken any steps at this time to address these weaknesses but will formulate a plan before fiscal year ending December
31, 2016.

II - Other Information.   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings

inflated stock price. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, on October 10, 2016, the Company reached a settlement agreement whereby
the Company agreed to pay $11,000 in exchange for a general release of all claims against the Company. As of October 10, 2016
the case is considered fully resolved and closed. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has recorded a contingent liability in
