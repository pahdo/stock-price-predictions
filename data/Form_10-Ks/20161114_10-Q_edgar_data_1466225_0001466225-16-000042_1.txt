  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS    
  Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was organized in Maryland on   June 3, 2009   to purchase a diversified portfolio of discounted U.S. commercial real estate and real estate-related assets in order to generate gains to stockholders from the potential appreciation in the value of the assets and to generate current income for stockholders by distributing cash flow from the Company s investments. Resource Real Estate Opportunity Advisor, LLC (the  Advisor ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ) has been engaged to manage the day-to-day operations of the Company.  
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities. C-III controls our Advisor, Resource Securities, Inc. ("Resource Securities"), the Company's dealer manager, and Resource Real Estate Opportunity Manager, LLC, the Company's property manager; C-III also controls all of the shares of common stock held by RAI. 
  Through its private offering and primary public offering, which concluded on December 13, 2013, the Company raised aggregate gross offering proceeds of   $645.8 million  , which resulted in the issuance of   64.9 million   shares of common stock, including   276,056   shares purchased by the Advisor and   1.2 million   shares sold in the Company's distribution reinvestment plan.  During the years ended   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company issued   5.3 million   additional shares for   $51.9 million   pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company additionally issued   2.0 million   shares for   $21.5 million   pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan.  The Company's distribution reinvestment plan offering is ongoing.   
  The Company has acquired, and may continue to acquire, real estate-related debt and equity. The Company has a particular focus on acquiring and operating multifamily assets, and it has targeted, and intends to continue to target, this asset class while also possibly acquiring interests in other types of commercial property assets consistent with its investment objectives.  The Company s targeted portfolio consists of commercial real estate assets, principally (i) multifamily rental properties purchased as non-performing or distressed loans or as real estate that  was foreclosed upon and sold by financial institutions and (ii) multifamily rental properties to which the Company can add value with a capital infusion (referred to as  value add properties ).  However, the Company is not limited in the types of real estate assets in which it may invest and, accordingly, it may invest in other real estate-related assets either directly or together with a co-investor or joint venture partner.   
  The Company is organized and conducts its operations in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The Company also operates its business in a manner intended to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  The consolidated financial statements and the information and tables contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented.  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  .

The Company follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810,  Consolidation,  and accordingly consolidates entities that are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) where it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it has been determined that the Company holds a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if the Company has the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE's financial performance; and (ii) if the Company has the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If the Company's interest possesses both of these characteristics, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and would be required to consolidate the VIE. The Company will continually assess its involvement with VIEs and re-evaluate the requirement to consolidate them. For consolidated entities (including VIEs of which the Company is the primary beneficiary), noncontrolling interests are presented and disclosed as a separate component of stockholders' equity (not as a liability or other item outside of stockholders' equity). Consolidated net income (loss) includes the noncontrolling interests  share of income (loss). All changes in the Company s ownership interest in a subsidiary are accounted for as stockholders' equity transactions if the Company retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary.  The portions of these entities that the Company does not own are presented as noncontrolling interests as of the dates and for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company's majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, which are VIEs, as follows:

(1)     On January 29, 2016, the Company sold its joint venture interest in Champion Farms to its joint venture partner.  As such, the Company deconsolidated the entity as of January 29, 2016.  The Company has no continuing involvement with this joint venture. (See Note 6) 
  (2)     On June 30, 2016, the Company sold its joint venture interest in Fieldstone to its joint venture partner.  As such, the Company deconsolidated the entity as of June 30, 2016.  The Company has no continuing involvement with this joint venture. (See Note 6) 
  (3)     On January 27, 2016, the Company and its joint venture partner sold Conifer Place, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the entity as of January 27, 2016. (See Note 6) 
    
  The Company's preferred equity investment was a VIE for which the Company had determined it was not the primary beneficiary; therefore, the Company did not consolidate the entity.  The Company was not considered the primary beneficiary of the preferred equity investee because it did not possess the unilateral power to direct the key activities of investee that were considered most significant.  The preferred equity investment was sold during 2016 and the Company has no further continuing involvement with the investee. Additional information with respect to the preferred equity investment is disclosed in Note 5.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  The Company presents the assets and liabilities of any rental properties which qualify as held for sale, separately in the consolidated balance sheets. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Both the real estate and the corresponding liabilities are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent to classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   three   rental properties included in assets held for sale. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   rental properties included in assets held for sale. 
  Rental Properties 
  The Company records acquired rental properties at fair value on their respective acquisition date.  The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life and depreciates the rental properties using the straight line method.  The Company anticipates the estimated useful lives of its assets by class as follows: 
                 Buildings 
    27.5 years 
      Building improvements 
    3.0 to 27.5 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    Shorter of lease term or expected useful life 

Improvements and replacements in excess of   $1,000   are capitalized when they have a useful life greater than or equal to   one   year. Resource Real Estate Opportunity Manager, LLC (the  Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, earns a construction management fee of   5%   of actual aggregate costs to construct improvements, or to repair, rehab or reconstruct a property.  These costs are capitalized along with the related asset.  Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  
  Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
  When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for permanent impairment.  This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.  The review also considers factors such as expected future

operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. 
  An impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of a property to be held and used.  For properties held for sale, the impairment loss would be the adjustment to fair value less the estimated cost to dispose of the asset.  There were   no   impairment charges during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Loans Held for Investment, Net 
  The Company records acquired performing loans held for investment at cost and reviews them for potential impairment at each balance sheet date.  The Company considers a loan to be impaired if one of two conditions exists.  The first condition is if, based on current information and events, management believes it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The second condition is if the loan is deemed to be a troubled-debt restructuring ( TDR ) where a concession has been given to a borrower in financial difficulty.  A TDR may not have an associated specific loan loss allowance if the principal and interest amount is considered recoverable based on current market conditions, expected collateral performance and/or guarantees made by the borrowers. 
  The amount of impairment, if any, is measured by comparing the recorded amount of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows or, as a practical expedient, the fair value of the collateral.  If a loan is deemed to be impaired, the Company records a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall.     
  Interest income from performing loans held for investment is recognized based on the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Fees related to any buy down of the interest rate are deferred as prepaid interest income and amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income.  The initial investment made in a purchased performing loan includes the amount paid to the seller plus fees.  The initial investment frequently differs from the related loan s principal amount at the date of the purchase.  The difference is recognized as an adjustment of the yield over the life of the loan.  Closing costs related to the purchase of a performing loan held for investment are amortized over the term of the loan and accreted as an adjustment to interest income. 
  The Company may acquire real estate loans at a discount due to the credit quality of such loans and the respective borrowers under such loans.  Revenues from these loans are recorded under the effective interest method.  Under this method, an effective interest rate ( EIR ) is applied to the cost basis of the real estate loan held for investment.  The EIR that is calculated when the loan held for investment is acquired remains constant and is the basis for subsequent impairment testing and income recognition.  However, if the amount and timing of future cash collections are not reasonably estimable, the Company accounts for the real estate receivable on the cost recovery method.  Under the cost recovery method of accounting, no income is recognized until the basis of the loan held for investment has been fully recovered.  
  Preferred Equity Investment 
    The Company recorded its preferred equity investments at amortized cost.  Investments carried at amortized cost were evaluated for impairment at each reporting date.  When an investment was impaired and that impairment was considered other than temporary, the amount of the loss accrual was calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value. This investment was repaid in full on June 6, 2016 (See Note 5). 
  Dividend income was recognized when earned based on the contractual terms of the preferred equity agreement.  
  Allocation of the Purchase Price of Acquired and Foreclosed Assets 
  The cost of rental properties acquired directly as fee interests and through foreclosing on a loan are allocated to net tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values  .    The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings, fixtures and improvements, and to identified intangible lease assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, the value of in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships.  Fair value estimates are based on information obtained from a number of sources, including information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities.  In addition, the Company may obtain independent appraisal reports. The information in the appraisal reports along with the aforementioned information available to the Company's management is used in allocating the purchase price. The independent appraisers have no involvement in management's allocation decisions other than providing market information.

  RESOURCE REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY REIT, INC.

  (unaudited) 

In allocating the purchase price, management also includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period.  Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses, to the extent that such costs have not already been incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. 
  The Company records above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.  The Company amortizes any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as an increase or reduction to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.     
  The Company measures the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if it were vacant.  Management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis).  Factors to be considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. 
  The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with that respective tenant.  Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the Company s existing relationships with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. 
  The Company amortizes the value of in-place leases to expense over the average remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of customer relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event will the amortization periods for the intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.  Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles associated with that tenant would be charged to expense in that period. 
  The determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to current market rental rates, discount rates and other variables.  The use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of the purchase price allocations, which could impact the amount of the Company s reported net income.  Initial purchase price allocations are subject to change until all information is finalized, which is generally within   one year   of the acquisition date. 
  Goodwill 
  The Company records the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the difference between the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each calendar year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
  Debt Modification and Extinguishment 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company refinanced   four   loans.  A refinancing transaction in which the issuance of new debt with a new lender and the concurrent satisfaction of an existing loan with an unrelated lender is considered an extinguishment.  An exchange of debt instruments with the same lender with substantially different terms is also considered an extinguishment.  However,  if the terms are not substantially different, then the exchange is considered a modification.   
    
  The Company calculates the change in the present values of the old debt instruments and the new debt instruments to determine if the terms were substantially different.  If the financing transactions is determined to be a extinguishment, the old debt is derecognized and the new debt is recorded at fair value.  Unamortized deferred loan costs and new fees paid to the lender are expensed and fees paid to third parties on the new debt are capitalized.  If the financing transaction is determined to be a modification, unamortized loan costs  and new fees paid to the lender continue to be amortized over the new term and fees paid to third parties are expensed.

Revenue Recognition 
  The Company recognizes minimum rent, including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and includes amounts expected to be received in later years in deferred rents.   
  The future minimum rental payments to be received from noncancelable operating leases for residential rental properties are   $57.6 million   and   $152,000   for the 12 month periods ending   September 30,     2017   and   2018  , respectively, and   none   thereafter. The future minimum rental payments to be received from noncancelable operating leases for commercial rental properties and antenna rentals are   $341,000  ,   $226,000  ,   $151,000  ,   $95,000  ,   $7,000  , and   $0   for the   12 month periods   ending   September 30,     2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  ,   2020  ,   2021  , and thereafter, respectively. 
  Revenue is primarily derived from the rental of residential housing units, however, included within rental income is other income such as pet fees, parking fees, and late fees, as well as property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs.  The Company records the ancillary charges in the period in which they are earned or received and records the reimbursements in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. Total other income included within rental income was   $2.7 million   and   $2.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Total other income included within rental income was   $8.3 million   and   $7.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Tenant Receivables 
  Tenant receivables are stated in the financial statements as amounts due from tenants net of an allowance for uncollectible receivables.  Payment terms vary and receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, security deposits held, the Company s previous loss history, the tenants  current ability to pay their obligations to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole.  The Company writes off receivables when they become uncollectible.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were allowances for uncollectible receivables of   $4,500   and   $24,100  , respectively. 
  Income Taxes 
  To maintain its REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute at least   90%   of its taxable net income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders as well as comply with other requirements, including certain asset, income and stock ownership tests.  As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that it distributes   100%   of its REIT taxable income each year.  If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, it is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent   four   taxable years following the year in which it fails its REIT qualification.  Accordingly, the Company s failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders. 
  The dividends-paid deduction of a REIT for qualifying dividends to its stockholders is computed using the Company s taxable income as opposed to net income reported on the financial statements.  Generally, taxable income differs from net income reported on the financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax provisions and not financial accounting principles. 
  The Company may elect to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ). In general, the Company s TRSs may hold assets and engage in activities that the Company cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business.  A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no TRSs.  
  The Company evaluates the benefits from tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax return.  Only the largest amount of benefits from tax positions that will more likely than not be sustainable upon examination are recognized by the Company.  The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, nor interest and penalties, recorded in its consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate significant adjustments to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

The Company is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by the taxing authorities in other states in which the Company has significant business operations.  The Company is not currently undergoing any examinations by taxing authorities. The Company is not subject to IRS examination for tax return years 2012 and prior. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted to common stock.  None of the   50,000   shares of convertible stock (discussed in Note   12  ) are included in the diluted earnings per share calculations because the necessary conditions for conversion have not been satisfied as of   September 30, 2016   (were such date to represent the end of the contingency period). 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. The Company has reclassified   $406,000   and   $1.4 million   of payroll expenses from General and Administrative to Rental Operating for the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The impact of the reclassifications made to prior year amounts are not material and did not affect net income. 
  In accordance with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", the Company has reclassified   $6.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs at   December 31, 2015   from assets to liabilities as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable.  In addition, deferred finance costs related to the Company's credit facility were reclassified from deferred financing costs to prepaid and other assets (See Note   9  ).   
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items". The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-01 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis", which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03. Upon adoption, the Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and adjusted the balance sheet of each individual period presented to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance.   The Company has reclassified   $6.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs at   December 31, 2015   from assets to liabilities as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable.   
  In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, "Interest - Imputation of Interest", which clarifies that debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements may continue to be accounted for as assets and not as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liabilities.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-15. Upon adoption, deferred finance costs related to the Company's credit facility were reclassified to prepaid expenses and other assets (See Note   9  ).  
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial

statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods.  Upon adoption, disclosure of the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required.  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.  The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.  ASU No. 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.  ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. ASU No. 2014-15 will be effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)", which requires lessees to recognize at the commencement date for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (b) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  ASU No. 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019.  The Company is evaluating this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU No. 2016-13 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is evaluating this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  ASU No. 2016-15 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a significant impact on its consolidated cash flows.

NOTE 12 - EQUITY    
  Preferred Stock 
  The Company s charter authorizes the Company to issue   10.0 million   shares of its   $0.01   par value preferred stock.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. 
  Common Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had issued shares of its   $0.01   par value common stock as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(1)    Includes   276,056   shares issued to the Advisor.  
  Convertible Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   50,000   shares of   $0.01   par value convertible stock outstanding of which the Advisor and affiliated persons own   49,063   shares and outside investors own   937   shares.  The convertible stock will convert into shares of the Company s common stock upon the occurrence of  (a) the Company having paid distributions to common stockholders that in the aggregate equal   100%   of the price at which the Company originally sold the shares plus an amount sufficient to produce a   10%   cumulative, non-compounded annual return on the shares at that price; or (b) if the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange and, on the 31st trading day after listing, the Company s value based on the average trading price of its common stock since the listing, plus prior distributions, combine to meet the same   10%   return threshold. 
  Each of these   two   events is a  Triggering Event.   Upon a Triggering Event, the Company's convertible stock will, unless its advisory agreement has been terminated or not renewed on account of a material breach by its Advisor, generally be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to   1  /  50,000   of the quotient of:  
           (A) 
    the lesser of  
     (i)   25%   of the amount, if any, by which  
           (1) 
    the value of the Company as of the date of the event triggering the conversion plus the total distributions paid to its stockholders through such date on the then-outstanding shares of its common stock exceeds 
              (2) 
    the sum of the aggregate issue price of those outstanding shares plus a   10%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the issue price of those outstanding shares as of the date of the event triggering the conversion, or  
     (ii)   15%   of the amount, if any, by which  
           (1) 
    the value of the Company as of the date of the event triggering the conversion plus the total distributions paid to its stockholders through such date on the then-outstanding shares of its common stock exceeds

    the sum of the aggregate issue price of those outstanding shares plus a   6%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the issue price of those outstanding shares as of the date of the event triggering the conversion, divided by 
              (B) 
    the value of the Company divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, in each case, as of the date of the event triggering the conversion.       
     Redemption of Securities   
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed   519,736   and   1,981,819   of its common shares, respectively.  The Company will not redeem in excess of   5%   of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the   12  -month period immediately prior to the effective date of redemption.  The Company's board of directors will determine at least quarterly whether it has sufficient excess cash to repurchase shares. Generally, the cash available for redemptions will be limited to proceeds from the Company's distribution reinvestment plan plus, if the Company has positive operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year,   1%   of all operating cash flow from the previous year.  All redemption requests tendered were honored during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may suspend, terminate or amend the Company's share redemption program without stockholder approval upon   30 days  ' notice if it determines that such suspension, termination or amendment is in the Company's best interest. The Company's board may also reduce the number of shares purchased under the share redemption program if it determines the funds otherwise available to fund the Company's share redemption program are needed for other purposes. These limitations apply to all redemptions, including redemptions sought upon a stockholder's death, qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility. 
  Distributions    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid aggregate distributions of   $32.2 million  , including   $10.8 million   of distributions paid in cash and   $21.5 million   of distributions reinvested in shares of common stock through the Company's distribution reinvestment plan, as follows (in thousands):  

NOTE 13 - FAIR VALUE MEASURES AND DISCLOSURES    
  In analyzing the fair value of its investments accounted for on a fair value basis, the Company follows the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.  The fair value of cash, tenant receivables and accounts payable, approximate their carrying value due to their short nature.  The hierarchy followed defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

  RESOURCE REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY REIT, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)

  (unaudited) 

Level 1 -   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  
  Level 2 -   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability. 
  Level 3 -   Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment.  The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.  However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare. 
  Rental properties obtained through a foreclosed note are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  The fair value of rental properties is usually estimated based on information obtained from a number of sources, including information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities.  The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings, fixtures and improvements, and identified intangible lease assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, the value of in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values. 
  Derivatives (interest rate caps) which are reported at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other assets are valued by a third-party pricing agent using an income approach with models that use, as their primary inputs, readily observable market parameters.  This valuation process considers factors including interest rate yield curves, time value, credit and volatility factors (Level 2). 
  The following table presents information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value (in thousands):

The carrying and fair values of the Company s loan held for investment, net, preferred equity investment, mortgage notes payable-outstanding borrowings, mortgage note payable -included in other liabilities associated with rental properties held for sale and credit facilities were as follows (in thousands): 

The fair values of the loan held for investment, net and preferred equity investment were estimated using rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 3). 
  The carrying amount of the mortgage notes payable presented is the outstanding borrowings excluding premium or discount and deferred finance costs, net.  The fair value of the mortgage notes payable was estimated using rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 3). 
  The fair value of the credit facility equals the carrying amounts because the variable interest rate is considered a market rate (Level 3). 
   
  NOTE 14 - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings.   
  As a condition to certain of the Company s financing facilities, from time to time the Company may be required to enter into certain derivative transactions as may be required by the lender.  These transactions would generally be in line with the Company s own risk management objectives and also served to protect the lender. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company entered into a total of   11   interest rate caps that were designated as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium.  
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows, indexed to USD-LIBOR, associated with existing variable-rate loan

agreements.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a loss of   $32,553   due to hedge ineffectiveness related to the sale of  The Nesbit Palisades and   $72,388   due to hedge ineffectiveness related to the sale of Ivy at Clear Creek. 
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (dollars in thousands):

NOTE 15 - OPERATING EXPENSE LIMITATION    
  Under its charter, the Company must limit its total operating expenses to the lesser of   2%   of its average invested assets or   25%   of its net income for the   four   most recently completed fiscal quarters, unless the conflicts committee of the Company s board of directors has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.  Operating expenses for the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016   were in compliance with the charter imposed limitation. 
   
  NOTE 16 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 31, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors declared a   $0.05   per share cash distribution to its common stockholders of record at the close of business on that day.  Such distribution was paid on November 1, 2016. 
  On October 14, 2016, the Company refinanced the mortgage note payable secured by Pinehurst.  The Company increased the mortgage note payable by   $3.4 million   as a result of the refinance. 
  On October 31, 2016, the Company refinanced the mortgage note payable secured by Cannery Lofts.  The Company increased the mortgage note payable by   $4.9 million   as a result of the refinance. 
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events and determined that no events have occurred, other than those disclosed above, which would require an adjustment to or additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT, Inc. and the notes thereto.  See also  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  preceding Part I, as well as the notes to our financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Resource Real Estate Opportunity OP, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 
  Overview 
  We were formed on   June 3, 2009  .  We commenced active real estate operations on September 7, 2010 when we raised the minimum offering amount in our initial public offering. 
  We have acquired a diversified portfolio of discounted U.S. commercial real estate and real estate-related debt. Our targeted portfolio consists of commercial real estate assets, principally (i) multifamily rental properties purchased as non-performing or distressed loans or as real estate owned by financial institutions and (ii) multifamily rental properties to which we can add value with a capital infusion (referred to as  value add properties ).  However, we are not limited in the types of real estate and real estate-related assets in which we may invest or whether we may invest in equity or debt secured by real estate and, accordingly, we may invest in other real estate assets or debt secured by real estate assets.  At   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately   37%   of our total assets in categories (i) and   63%   of our total assets in category (ii). 
  We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities.  We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition.  Thus, to the extent our Advisor presents us with investment opportunities that allow us to meet the requirements to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code and to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act, our portfolio composition may vary from what we have initially disclosed.   
    
  On September 8, 2016, Resource America, Inc. ("RAI"), the indirect parent corporation of our Advisor, was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ( C-III ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 22, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of C III merged with and into RAI, with RAI surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of C-III. 
    
  The primary portion of our initial public offering commenced on June 16, 2010 and closed on December 13, 2013. We continue to offer shares to our existing stockholders pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We describe these offerings further in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below. 
  Results of Operations 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in a total of   30   multifamily properties. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we disposed of our interests in   one   and   six   properties, respectively.  Since our inception, we have acquired interests in   48   multifamily properties, representing   13,532   units. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold our interests in   18   of those properties.  Our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable, or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our targeted portfolio, the multifamily residential housing industry and real estate generally, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of such assets or those that we expect to acquire.

Revenues:    The   $3.1 million   increase in rental income for the   30   properties we owned during both the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflects implementation of our investment strategy to increase monthly rental income after renovating and stabilizing operations and was primarily comprised of: 

Expenses:    Our total rental operating expenses for the   30   properties we owned during both the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   decreased by   $1.6 million   primarily due to lower real estate taxes and a reduction in casualty losses due to the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds. Total rental operating expenses for the all other category decreased by   $2.9 million   primarily due to the sale of properties in 2015 and 2016. 
  Management fees decreased by   $315,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily related to the decrease in the asset management fee paid to the Advisor due to additional property dispositions during 2016.  
  General and administrative decreased by   $524,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to the sale of properties in 2015 and 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization is comprised of the depreciation on our rental properties and amortization of intangible assets related to in-place leases which are amortized over a period of approximately six to eight months after acquisition.  The increases (decreases) in the components of depreciation and amortization during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands): 

The overall decrease in depreciation and amortization for properties owned both periods was due to amortization no longer being taken on intangible assets due to no acquisitions during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization in the all other category was due to the sale of our interests in   six   properties subsequent to   September 30, 2015  .

Interest expense increased by   $205,000   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs of $289,000 and the realized loss on the change in the fair value of the interest rate cap of $33,000 related to the sale of The Nesbit Palisades.  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   also includes $714,000 of losses on the extinguishment of loan costs related to refinancing of The Westside Apartments, Verona Apartment Homes, and Skyview Apartment Homes.  These increases were offset by decreases in interest expense due to the sale of properties in 2015 and 2016.

Expenses:    Our total rental operating expenses for the   26   properties we owned during both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   decreased by   $1.0 million   and was comprised primarily of reductions in casualty losses due to two large fires that occurred in 2015. Total rental operating expenses for the all other category decreased by   $4.4 million   primarily due to the sale of properties in 2015 and 2016. 
  Acquisition costs decreased by   $5.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as no properties were purchased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

In June 2015, we purchased two properties with a total purchase price of   $167.0 million  .  The asset management fee is based on the higher of the cost or appraised value of real estate investments.    
  General and administrative decreased by   $910,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily due to the sale of properties in 2015 and 2016. 
       Loss on the disposal of assets decreased by   $2.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to the timing of the replacement of appliances at our rental properties in conjunction with unit upgrades.       
  Depreciation and amortization is comprised of the depreciation on our rental properties and amortization of intangible assets related to in-place leases which are amortized over a period of approximately six to eight months after acquisition.  The increases (decreases) in the components of depreciation and amortization during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands):

The overall increase in depreciation for properties owned both periods is due to the additional   $34.0 million   in capital improvements made during the periods in accordance with our planned renovations.  
  Net gains on dispositions of properties and joint venture interests included in other income (expense) increased by   $9.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as detailed below (in thousands):   

The net gain on disposition of properties and joint venture interests on Conifer Place includes   $6.2 million   which is attributable to noncontrolling interests.   
  Interest expense increased by   $1.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs of $503,000 and the realized loss on the change in the fair value of the interest rate cap of $105,000 related to the sales of The Nesbit Palisades, The Ivy at Clear Creek, and Affinity at Winter Park. Interest expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   also includes $854,000 of losses on the extinguishment of loan costs related to refinancing of Tech Center Square, The Westside Apartments, Verona Apartment Homes, and Skyview Apartment Homes. These increases were offset by the net decrease in interest expense due to the sale and purchase of properties in 2015 and 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We have derived the capital required to purchase real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of our private and public offerings, secured financings from banks, proceeds from the sale of real estate, and cash flows generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments. 
  We initially allocated a portion of the funds we raised in our initial public offering to preserve capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of the properties we have acquired and those properties that we may acquire in the future.  If these allocated amounts and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investment in one or more

     (Back to Index)  

properties, debt investments or other assets we may hold.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to access additional funds upon acceptable terms when we need them. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  We deployed a total of   $20.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for capital expenditures.  The properties in which we deployed the most capital during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   ended are listed separately and the capital expenditures made on all other properties are aggregated in "All other properties" below (in thousands):  

Initial Public Offering 
  The primary portion of our initial public offering closed on December 13, 2013.  On December 26, 2013, the unsold primary offering shares were deregistered and, on December 30, 2013, the registration of the shares issuable pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan was continued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3. A new Registration Statement on Form S-3 was filed in May 2016 to continue the distribution reinvestment plan offering. 
  We continue to offer up to   $120.0 million   of shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan under which our stockholders may elect to have distributions reinvested in additional shares at $10.83 per share, which is our current estimated value per share.  
  Gross offering proceeds 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,     shares of our   $0.01   par value common stock have been issued as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(1)    Includes   276,056   shares issued to the Advisor.  
  Credit Facility 
    The following is a summary of our credit facility:

     (Back to Index)  

Draws under the Bank of America Credit Facility are secured by certain of our properties with an aggregate value of   $42.0 million   and are guaranteed by us.  We were in compliance with all covenants under this facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Mortgage Debt 

(Back  to Index)  
  45 

     (Back to Index)  

For maturity dates, related interest rates, monthly debt service, and monthly escrow payments, see Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate of all our outstanding indebtedness was   3.53%  . 
  Based on current lending market conditions, we expect that the debt financing we incur, on a total portfolio basis, will not exceed 50% to 55% of the cost of our real estate investments (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) plus the value of our other assets (  50%   as of   September 30, 2016  ). We may also increase the amount of debt financing we use with respect to an investment over the amount originally incurred if the value of the investment increases subsequent to our acquisition and if credit market conditions permit us to do so.  Our charter limits us from incurring debt such that our total liabilities exceed 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) of our tangible assets, although we may exceed this limit under certain circumstances. We expect that our primary liquidity source for acquisitions and long-term funding will include proceeds from dispositions and, to the extent we co-invest with other entities, capital from any future joint venture partners. We may also pursue a number of potential other funding sources, including mortgage loans, portfolio level credit lines and government financing. 
  Operating Costs 
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make payments to our Advisor. During our operating stage, we expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor for the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us.  We describe these payments in more detail in Note   11   of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee of our board of directors has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expense reimbursements for the four fiscal quarters ended   September 30, 2016   did not exceed the charter imposed limitation. 
   
  Distributions    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions of   $32.2 million  , including   $10.8 million   of distributions paid in cash and   $21.5 million   of distributions reinvested in shares of common stock through our distribution reinvestment plan, as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

(Back  to Index)  
  46 

     (Back to Index)  

Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flows used in operating activities were as follows for the three quarters ended   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):        

  Our net income attributable to common stockholders' for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $14.2 million   and net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was   $8.2 million  .  Our cumulative cash distributions and net loss attributable to common shareholders from inception through   September 30, 2016   were   $123.9 million   and   $86.3 million  , respectively.  We have funded our cumulative distributions, which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders, with cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from dispositions of properties and joint venture interests and proceeds from debt financing. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operating activities or proceeds from dispositions of properties and joint venture interests, we will have fewer funds available for investment in commercial real estate and real estate-related debt, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
   
  Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
  Funds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance.  We use FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts to be net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains (or losses) from sales of property (including deemed sales and settlements of pre-existing relationships), plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after related adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and subsidiaries and noncontrolling interests.  We believe that FFO is helpful to our investors and our management as a measure of operating performance because it excludes real estate-related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and extraordinary items, and as a result, when compared year to year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which are not immediately apparent from net income.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate and intangibles diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient.  As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, is helpful for our investors in understanding our performance.  Factors that impact FFO include start-up costs, fixed costs, delay in buying assets, lower yields on cash held in accounts, income from portfolio properties and other portfolio assets, interest rates on acquisition financing and operating expenses.  In addition, FFO will be affected by the types of investments in our targeted portfolio which consist of, but are not limited to:  (i) multifamily rental properties purchased as non-performing or distressed loans or as real estate owned by financial institutions and (ii) multifamily rental properties to which we can add value with a capital infusion (referred to as  value add properties ). 
  
    (Back  to Index)  
  47 

     (Back to Index)  

Since FFO was promulgated, GAAP has adopted several new accounting pronouncements, such that management and many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of FFO alone to be insufficient. Accordingly, in addition to FFO, we use modified funds from operations, or MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, or IPA.  MFFO excludes from FFO the following items: 
           (1) 
    acquisition fees and expenses; 
              (2) 
    straight-line rent amounts, both income and expense; 
              (3) 
    amortization of above- or below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; 
              (4) 
    amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments; 
              (5) 
    impairment charges; 
              (6) 
    gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; 
              (7) 
    gains or losses on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivatives holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our operations; 
              (8) 
    gains or losses related to fair-value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, including interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives; 
              (9) 
    gains or losses related to consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting; 
              (10) 
    gains or losses related to contingent purchase price adjustments; and 
              (11) 
    adjustments related to the above items for unconsolidated entities in the application of equity accounting. 
     We believe that MFFO is helpful in assisting management assess the sustainability of operating performance     in future periods and, in particular, after our acquisition stage is complete, primarily because it excludes acquisition expenses that affect property operations only in the period in which the property is acquired. Thus, MFFO provides helpful information relevant to evaluating our operating performance in periods in which there is no acquisition activity.     
  As explained below, management s evaluation of our operating performance excludes the items considered in the calculation based on the following economic considerations.  Many of the adjustments in arriving at MFFO are not applicable to us.  Nevertheless, we explain below the reasons for each of the adjustments made in arriving at our MFFO definition: 
             
    Acquisition expenses.   In evaluating investments in real estate, including both business combinations and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, management s investment models and analysis differentiate costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment. Prior to 2009, acquisition costs for both of these types of investments were capitalized under GAAP; however, beginning in 2009, acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed.  Both of these acquisition costs will continue to be funded from the proceeds of debt financing and proceeds from property dispositions and not from operations.  We believe by excluding expensed acquisition costs, MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.  Acquisition expenses include those paid to our Advisor or third parties. 
                
    Adjustments for straight-line rents and amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments  .  In the proper application of GAAP, rental receipts and discounts and premiums on debt investments are allocated to periods using various systematic methodologies. This application will result in income recognition that could be significantly different than underlying contract terms. By adjusting for these items, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance. 
                
    Adjustments for amortization of above or below market intangible lease assets  .  Similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangibles diminishes predictably over time and that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since real estate values and market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate. 
                
    Impairment charges, gains or losses related to fair-value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and gains or losses related to contingent purchase price adjustments  .  Each of these items relates to a fair value adjustment, which is based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions and specific performance of the holding which may not be directly attributable to current operating performance.  As these gains or losses relate to underlying long-term assets and liabilities, management  
     
    (Back  to Index)  
  48 

     (Back to Index)  

believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information by focusing on the changes in our core operating fundamentals rather than changes that may reflect anticipated gains or losses. In particular, because GAAP impairment charges are not allowed to be reversed if the underlying fair values improve or because the timing of impairment charges may lag the onset of certain operating consequences, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information related to current consequences, benefits and sustainability related to rental rate, occupancy and other core operating fundamentals. 
             
    Adjustment for gains or losses related to early extinguishment of hedges, debt, consolidation or deconsolidation and contingent purchase price  .  Similar to extraordinary items excluded from FFO, these adjustments are not related to continuing operations.  By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods and to other real estate operators. 
     By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that also assists investors and analysts in the assessment of the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed.  We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the real estate industry.  MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities or as affected by other MFFO adjustments.  However, investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our acquisition stage is completed, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance and the reported book value of our common stock and stockholders  equity during the periods in which properties are acquired. 
  As an opportunity REIT, a core element of our investment strategy and operations is the acquisition of distressed and value-add properties and the rehabilitation and renovation of such properties in an effort to create additional value in such properties.  As part of our operations, we intend to realize gains from such value-add efforts through the strategic disposition of such properties after we have added value through the execution of our business plan.  As we do not intend to hold any of our properties for a specific amount of time, we intend to take advantage of opportunities to realize gains from our value-add efforts on a regular basis during the course of our operations as such opportunities become available, in all events subject to the rules regarding "prohibited transactions" of real estate investment trusts of the Internal Revenue Code.  Therefore, we also use adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, in addition to FFO and MFFO when evaluating our operations.  We calculate AFFO by adding/subtracting gains/losses realized on sales of our properties from MFFO.  We believe that AFFO presents useful information that assists investors and analysts in the assessment of our operating performance as it is reflective of the impact that regular, strategic property dispositions have on our continuing operations. 
  Neither FFO, MFFO nor AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stockholders, nor as an indication of our liquidity, nor are any of these measures indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to fund distributions.  In particular, as we may continue to acquire properties as part of our ongoing operations, acquisition costs and other adjustments that are increases to MFFO and AFFO are, and may continue to be, a significant use of cash.  Accordingly, FFO, MFFO and AFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.  Our FFO, MFFO and AFFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs.

The following section presents our calculation of FFO, MFFO and AFFO and provides additional information related to our operations (in thousands, except per share amounts).  Amounts reported in the table below include adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests.   

Critical Accounting Policies 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and cost and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to certain accrued liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we were obligated to fund up to an additional   $1.1 million   for the Spring Hill preferred equity investment in increments of   $150,000   upon request as long as no triggering event had occurred.  However, this investment was repaid in full on June 6, 2016 and we are no longer obligated to fund additional sums.  We did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.

Subsequent Events   
  On October 31, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a   $0.05   per share cash distribution to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on that day.  Such distribution was paid on November 1, 2016. 
  On October 14, 2016, we refinanced the mortgage note payable secured by Pinehurst.  We increased the mortgage note payable by   $3.4 million   as a result of the refinance. 
  On October 31, 2016, we refinanced the mortgage note payable secured by Cannery Lofts.  We increased the mortgage note payable by   $4.9 million   as a result of the refinance. 
  We have evaluated subsequent events and determined that no events have occurred, other than those disclosed above, which would require an adjustment to or additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     We are exposed to market risk from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates.  We do not have exposure to any other significant market risks.  We monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates, primarily changes in LIBOR as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding mortgage loans.   
  We enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, we entered into a total of   11   interest rate caps that were designated as cash flow hedges during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $206.0 million   and   $282.0 million  , respectively, in variable rate debt outstanding.  If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately   $2.3 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively.  
  In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate mortgage notes payable.  Fixed rate mortgage notes payable with an aggregate carrying value of   $348.9 million   and   $351.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, had an estimated aggregate fair value of   $353.1 million   and   $359.7 million  , respectively, computed using rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.  If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by   $15.6 million   and   $14.0 million  , respectively.   
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. 
   
           ITEM 2. 
     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   
     Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities 
  All securities sold by us during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were sold in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). 
  Redemption of Securities  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed shares of our common stock as follows: 

(1) 
    All redemptions of equity securities in the three months ended     September 30, 2016   were made pursuant to our share redemption program. All redemption requests tendered were honored during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
               (3) 
    We currently limit the dollar value and number of shares that may be redeemed under the program as described below. 
     We will not redeem in excess of 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the 12-month period immediately prior to the effective date of redemption. Our board of directors will determine at least quarterly whether it has sufficient excess cash to redeem shares. Generally, the cash available for redemptions will be limited to proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan plus, if we have positive operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year, 1% of all operating cash flow from the previous year. 
    
  Our share redemption program, including redemptions sought upon a stockholder's death or disability or upon confinement of a stockholder to a long-term care facility, will be available only for stockholders who purchase their shares directly from us or the transferees mentioned below, and is not intended to provide liquidity to any stockholder who acquired his or her shares by purchase from another stockholder. In connection with a request for redemption, the stockholder or his or her estate, heir or beneficiary will be required to certify to us that the stockholder acquired the shares to be repurchased either (1) directly from us or (2) from the original investor by way of (i) a bona fide gift not for value to, or for the benefit of, a member of the investor's immediate or extended family (including the investor's spouse, parents, siblings, children or grandchildren and including relatives by marriage), (ii) through a transfer to a custodian, trustee or other fiduciary for the account of the investor or members of the investor's immediate or extended family in connection with an estate planning transaction, including by bequest or inheritance upon death or (iii) operation of law. 
  Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may suspend, terminate or amend our share redemption program without stockholder approval upon 30 days' notice if it determines that such suspension, termination or amendment is in our best interest. Our board may also reduce the number of shares purchased under the share redemption program if it determines the funds otherwise available to fund our share redemption program are needed for other purposes. These limitations apply to all redemptions, including redemptions sought upon the stockholder's death, qualifying disability or confinement to a long-term care facility.

  SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
  I, Alan F. Feldman, certify that: 
           1) 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of Resource Real Estate Opportunity REIT, Inc.; 
              2) 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3) 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
