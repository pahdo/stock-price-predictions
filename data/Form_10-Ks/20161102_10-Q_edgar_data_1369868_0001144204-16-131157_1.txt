 September  30, 2016 AND 2015 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION, SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION
AND RISKS  

(a)   
 Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
of China Biologic Products, Inc. (the  Company ). The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position as of September 30,
2016, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been made. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives
of property, plant and equipment and intangibles with definite lives, the allowances for doubtful accounts, the fair value determinations
of stock compensation awards, the realizability of deferred tax assets and inventories, the recoverability of intangible assets,
land use rights, property, plant and equipment, equity method investment and loan receivable, and accruals for income tax uncertainties
and other contingencies. 

(b)   Explanatory Note    

For the reasons discussed below, the Company
has corrected the number of the authorized shares of common stock from 1,000,000,000, as disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016, to 100,000,000. 

In connection with the 2016 annual meeting
of stockholders (the  Annual Meeting ), the Company filed a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A on April 29,
2016 that included a proposal to amend the Company s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares
of common stock from 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. Such definitive proxy statement indicated that the approval of a majority of
the quorum of stockholders present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting was necessary to approve the proposal to amend the
Company s certificate of incorporation. However, under Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the approval
of a majority of outstanding shares is required to amend the Company s certificate of incorporation. At the Annual Meeting,
the Company received the vote of a majority of the quorum in favor of the proposal, but not the required majority of outstanding
shares. The Company did not receive the approval required under the Delaware General Corporation Law and therefore the number of
authorized shares of common stock remains at 100,000,000. 

The Company considers such revision to be immaterial and the revision had no impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements other than disclosure of the number of shares authorized on the face of the balance sheets. 

(c)   
 Significant Concentration and Risks  

The Company s operations are carried
out in the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ) and are subject to specific considerations and significant
risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial
condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general
state of the PRC economy. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect
to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation,
among other matters. 

The Company maintains cash and deposit
balances at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for
its bank accounts located in the United States or may exceed Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board insured limits for its bank accounts
located in Hong Kong or may exceed the insured limits for its bank accounts in China established by China Deposit Insurance Fund
Management Institution. 

Total cash at banks and deposits as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $202,109,273 and $182,291,723, respectively, of which $2,461,610 and $3,020,569
are insured, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in uninsured bank deposits and does not believe that it is
exposed to any significant risks on cash held in bank accounts. 

The Company s two major products
are human albumin and human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection ( IVIG ). Human albumin accounted for 37.0% and
38.7% of the total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 38.9% and 37.5% of the total
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. IVIG accounted for 33.1% and 41.4% of the total sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 35.5% and 43.6% of the total sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the market demands for human albumin and IVIG cannot be sustained in the future
or the price of human albumin and IVIG decreases, the Company s operating results could be adversely affected. 

Substantially all of the Company s
customers are located in the PRC. There were no customers that individually comprised 10% or more of the total sales during the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. There was no customer represented more than 10% of
accounts receivables as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers  financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers.

There was one supplier, namely, Xinjiang
Deyuan Bioengineering Co., Ltd. ( Xinjiang Deyuan ), that comprised 10% or more of the total purchases for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. There was no supplier that represented more
than 10% of accounts payables as at September 30, 2016. There was one supplier that represented more than 10% of accounts payables
as at December 31, 2015.

NOTE 5   DEPOSITS RELATED TO LAND
USE RIGHTS  

In 2012, Guizhou Taibang made a refundable
payment of RMB83,400,000 (approximately $12,489,150) to the local government in connection with the public bidding for a land use
right in Guizhou Province. Given the decrease of the land area to be provided by the local government, RMB13,000,000 (approximately
$1,946,750) and RMB10,000,000 (approximately $1,497,500) was refunded by the local government in December 2013 and January 2014,
respectively. Guizhou Taibang completed the bidding and purchased the land use right in December 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, RMB59,665,759 (approximately $8,934,947) was refunded by the local government. The remaining deposit is expected
to be refunded in 2017. 

NOTE 6   LOAN RECEIVABLE  

(a)  Current   

In June 2016, the Company entered into
a RMB40,000,000 (approximately $5,990,000) loan agreement with Xinjiang Deyuan. Pursuant to the agreement, Guizhou Taibang agreed
to provide Xinjiang Deyuan with interest-bearing loans at an interest rate of 6% per annum. The loan is unsecured and due on the
earlier of 1) within five days after Xinjiang Deyuan obtaining other loans from financial institutions, or 2) September 20, 2016.
Interest will be paid on the last day of each month. On July 1, 2016, RMB40,000,000 (approximately $5,990,000) was lent to Xinjiang
Deyuan. 

On October 18, 2016, the Company entered
into a supplemental agreement to the loan agreement with Xinjiang Deyuan, pursuant to which the principal of the loan was agreed
to offset purchase payment of plasma from Xinjiang Deyuan in two installments, with the remaining principal of the loan, if any,
being repaid by Xinjiang Deyuan no later than December 20, 2016. The Company has the right to charge an interest rate of 9% per
annum for any overdue loan since September 21, 2016 according to loan agreement. 

Interest income of $79,906 was accrued
by Guizhou Taibang for the three months and nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and $60,012 was received by Guizhou Taibang
for the three months and nine months period ended September 30, 2016.  

(b)  Non-current   

In August 2015, the Company entered into
a cooperation agreement with Xinjiang Deyuan and the controlling shareholder of Xinjiang Deyuan. Pursuant to the agreement, Guizhou
Taibang agreed to provide Xinjiang Deyuan with interest-bearing loans at an interest rate of 6% per annum with an aggregate principal
amount of RMB300,000,000 (approximately $44,925,000). The loans are due July 31, 2018 and secured by a pledge of Deyuan Shareholder s
58.02% equity interest in Xinjiang Deyuan. Interest will be paid on the 20th day of the last month of each quarter. For the year

$6,190,147) was lent during the three months period ended March 31, 2016. 

Interest income of $638,622 and $1,985,767
was accrued and received by Guizhou Taibang for the three months and nine months period ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 7   INCOME TAX  

In October 2014, Shandong provincial government
granted Shandong Taibang the High and New Technology Enterprise certificate. This certificate entitled Shandong Taibang to enjoy
a preferential income tax rate of 15% for a period of three years from 2014 to 2016. 

According to Cai Shui [2011] No. 58 dated
July 27, 2011, Guizhou Taibang, being a qualified enterprise located in the western region of PRC, enjoys a preferential income
tax rate of 15% effective retroactively from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020. 

The Company s effective income tax
rates were 17% and 17% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s effective income tax rates were
16% and 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

7   

As of and for the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and thus no interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits were recorded. In addition, the Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly
within the next 12 months.

NOTE 9   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments at the relevant balance sheet dates: 

Short-term financial instruments
(including cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, accounts receivable, other receivables, loan receivable-current, accounts
payable, and other payables and accrued expenses)   The carrying amounts of the short-term financial instruments approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

8   

Loan receivable-non current  
The carrying amounts of loan receivable-non current approximate their fair value. The fair value is estimated using discounted
cash flow analysis based on the Company s incremental borrowing rates for similar borrowing.  

NOTE 10   SALES  

The Company s sales are primarily
derived from the manufacture and sale of Human Albumin and Immunoglobulin products. The Company s sales by significant types
of product for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

Legal proceedings  

Dispute with Jie an over Certain Capital Injection
into Guizhou Taibang   

In May 2007, a 91% majority of Guizhou
Taibang s shareholders approved a plan to raise additional capital from qualified strategic investors through the issuance
of an additional 20,000,000 shares of Guizhou Taibang. The plan required all existing Guizhou Taibang shareholders to waive their
rights of first refusal to subscribe for the additional shares. The remaining 9% minority shareholder of Guizhou Taibang s
shares, Guizhou Jie an Company, or Jie an, did not support the plan and did not waive its right of first refusal. In
May 2007, Guizhou Taibang signed an Equity Purchase Agreement with certain alleged strategic investors (who concealed their background),
pursuant to which such investors agreed to invest an aggregate of RMB50,960,000 (approximately $7,631,260) in exchange for 21.4%
of Guizhou Taibang s equity interests. Such Equity Purchase Agreement was not approved or ratified by over two-thirds supermajority
of Guizhou Taibang s shareholders, which approval or ratification is required under the PRC Company Law. At the same time,
as an existing shareholder, Jie an also subscribed for 1,800,000 shares, representing its pro rata share of the 20,000,000
shares being offered. In total, Guizhou Taibang received RMB50,960,000 (approximately $7,631,260) from the investors and RMB6,480,000
(approximately $970,380) from Jie an. 

9   

In June 2007, Jie an brought a lawsuit
against Guizhou Taibang, alleging that it had a right to acquire the 18,200,000 shares offered to the investors under the Equity
Purchase Agreement. The trial court denied Jie an s request, and the PRC Supreme Court ultimately sustained the original
ruling in May 2009 and denied the rights of first refusal of Jie an over the 18,200,000 shares. 

During the second quarter of 2010, Jie an
requested that Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of additional capital injection with the local administration of
industry and commerce, or AIC. Guizhou Taibang s board of directors withheld its required ratification of Jie an s
request, pending the outcome of the ongoing litigation. In March 2012, Jie an brought another lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang
for refusing to register the shares. In July 2013, the trial court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Jie an
did not appeal the dismissal. 

In December 2013, Jie an brought
a third lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang, requesting Guizhou Taibang to register 1.8 million shares under its name with the local
AIC. In July 2014, the trial court denied Jie an s request to register such shares. Despite the denial of Jie an s
share registration request, the trial court, however, in its ruling, ordered Guizhou Taibang to pay accumulated dividends of RMB13,809,197
(approximately $2,067,927) associated with these shares and the related interest expenses to Jie an. Guizhou Taibang and
Jie an subsequently filed a cross-appeal. In December 2014, the appellate court ruled in favor of Jie an supporting
its request to register 1.8 million shares and ordered Guizhou Taibang to pay Jie an its share of accumulated dividends
of RMB18,339,227 (approximately $2,746,299) associated with these shares plus the related interest expenses to Jie an. In
the first half of 2015, Guizhou Taibang paid an aggregate of RMB22,639,227 (approximately $3,390,224) to the trial court held
in escrow pending further appeal of this case. In June 2015, Guizhou Taibang appealed to the High Court of Guizhou, which overruled
the decision of the appellate court and remanded the case to the trial court for retrial in September 2015. In August 2016, the
trial court granted Jie an s petition to withdraw the lawsuit as Jie an sought to withdraw its capital contribution
in Guizhou Taibang pursuant to an agreement dated July 31, 2016. The funds held in escrow will be credited to the consideration
payable to Jie an for the capital withdrawal.  

In November 2013, Guizhou Taibang held
a shareholders meeting and the shareholders passed resolutions, or the November 2013 Resolutions, that, inter alia, (i) determined
that it was no longer necessary for Guizhou Taibang to obtain additional capital from investors; (ii) rejected Jie an s
request that Jie an subscribe for additional shares of Guizhou Taibang alone and one or more other shareholders reduce their
shareholding in Guizhou Taibang; and (iii) approved the issuance of a total of 20,000,000 new shares to all existing shareholders
on a pro rata basis. Jie an subsequently filed a fourth lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang in December 2013, requesting that
the court declare the November 2013 Resolutions void. Both the trial court and the appellate court denied Jie an s
request.  

In March 2014, Guizhou Taibang held another
shareholders meeting and the shareholders passed resolutions, or the March 2014 Resolutions, that, inter alia, re-calculated the
ownership percentage in Guizhou Taibang based on the November 2013 Resolutions and the additional capital injections from existing
shareholders. Guizhou Taibang subsequently updated the registration with the local AIC regarding the additional capital injections
in August 2014. In September 2014, Jie an and Shenzhen Yigong Shengda Technology Co., Ltd., or Yigong Shengda, another minority
shareholder of Guizhou Taibang filed a lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang, requesting that the court declare both the November 2013
Resolutions and the March 2014 Resolutions void and instruct Guizhou Taibang to withdraw the AIC registration. In November 2014,
the trial court suspended this case pending the final outcome of the third lawsuit filed by Jie an. In October 2015, the
trial court denied their request. In May 2016, the appellate court vacated the trial court s decision to uphold Guizhou Taibang s
shareholders resolution, and remanded the case for retrial. In August 2016, the trial court granted the petitions by Jie an
and Yigong Shengda to withdraw the lawsuit as Jie an and Yigong Shengda sought to withdraw their respective capital contributions
in Guizhou Taibang pursuant to an agreement dated July 31, 2016. 

On July 31, 2016, Guiyang Dalin Biologic
Technologies Co., Ltd., or Guiyang Dalin, Guizhou Taibang, Jie an and Yigong Shengda entered into an agreement, pursuant
to which Jie an and Yigong Shengda agreed to withdraw their respective capital contributions in Guizhou Taibang for an aggregate
consideration of RMB415,000,000 (approximately $62,146,250). In August 2016, Guizhou Taibang paid the first installment of RMB90,000,000
(approximately $13,502,700) of the consideration to Jie an and Yigong Shengda. Guizhou Taibang completed the AIC registration
for the foregoing capital withdrawal in October 2016 and will pay the balance of the consideration to Jie an and Yigong Shengda
in accordance with the agreement. As a result of the capital withdrawal, Guiyang Dalin has become the sole shareholder of Guizhou
Taibang. 

As of September 30, 2016, Guizhou Taibang
had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to Jie an in the amounts of RMB5,040,000 (approximately $754,740) as received
funds in respect of the 1.8 million shares in dispute, RMB1,440,000 (approximately $215,640) for the over-paid subscription price
paid by Jie an and RMB3,913,734 (approximately $586,082) for the accrued interest.

Dispute with Certain Individual Investor
over Certain Capital Injection into Guizhou Taibang   

In part due to the invalidity of the Equity
Purchase Agreement with certain alleged strategic investors in May 2007, which was never approved or ratified by Guizhou Taibang s
shareholders, such investors  equity ownership in Guizhou Taibang and the related increase in registered capital of Guizhou
Taibang have never been registered with the local AIC. In January 2010, one individual among such investors brought a lawsuit against
Guizhou Taibang requesting to register his 14.35% ownership interest in Guizhou Taibang with the local AIC and seeking the distribution
of his share of Guizhou Taibang s dividends declared since 2007. 

In October 2010, the trial court denied
such individual investor s right as shareholder of Guizhou Taibang and his entitlement to share the dividends, which ruling
was reaffirmed after a re-trial by the same trial court in December 2012. After such ruling, Guizhou Taibang attempted to return
the originally received fund of RMB34,160,000 (approximately $5,115,460) to such investor by wiring the fund back to his bank account
but was unable to do so due to the closure of his bank account. Another investor, however, accepted the returned fund of RMB11,200,000
(approximately $1,677,200) from Guizhou Taibang in November 2010. In 2013, the same individual investor appealed the case to the
PRC Supreme Court, which also denied his claims for shareholder status in Guizhou Taibang and the related dividend distribution
and accrued interest in September 2013. Such investor subsequently attempted to seek a re-trial by the PRC Supreme Court, which
request was denied by the PRC Supreme Court in January 2014. He then applied to the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to request for a
review of the PRC Supreme Court s decision and seek an appeal by the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to the PRC Supreme Court for
an ultimate re-trial on his behalf. In July 2015, the PRC Supreme Procuratorate rejected his request for review. 

As of September 30, 2016, Guizhou Taibang
had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to the investors of RMB34,160,000 (approximately $5,115,460) as originally received
funds from such individual investor in respect of the shares in dispute, RMB18,895,852 (approximately $2,829,654) for the interest
expenses, and RMB341,600 (approximately $51,155) for the 1% penalty imposed by the Equity Purchase Agreement for any breach in
the event that Guizhou Taibang is required to return the original investment amount to such investor.

NOTE 13   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU
2016-02 ), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing
lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting standards
and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for public
companies for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU
2016-09 ), which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes,
classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows.  This standard
will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addressed and provided guidance for each of eight specific
cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This standard will be effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  This standard required that companies
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (other than inventory) when the transfer occurs. 
Current guidance prohibits companies from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until
the asset has been sold to an outside party.  This standard will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the
impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.

Overview of Our Business  

We are a biopharmaceutical company principally
engaged in the research, development, manufacturing and sales of human plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, or plasma products,
in China. We operate our business through two majority owned subsidiaries, Shandong Taibang, a company based in Tai an, Shandong
Province and Guizhou Taibang, a company based in Guiyang, Guizhou Province. We also hold a minority equity interest in Huitian,
a plasma products company based in Xi an, Shaanxi Province. 

We have a strong product portfolio with
over 20 different dosage forms of plasma products and other biopharmaceutical products across nine categories. Our principal products
are human albumin and immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, or IVIG. Albumin has been used for almost 50 years to treat critically
ill patients by assisting the maintenance of adequate blood volume and pressure. IVIG is used for certain disease prevention and
treatment by enhancing specific immunity. These products use human plasma as their principal raw material. Sales of human albumin
products represented approximately 37.0% and 38.7% of our total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and 38.9% and 37.5% of our total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of IVIG products
represented approximately 33.1% and 41.4% of our total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and 35.5% and 43.6% of our total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All of our products
are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections. 

Our sales model focuses on direct sales
to hospitals and inoculation centers and is complemented by distributor sales. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, our top five customers accounted for approximately 15.6% and 13.9%, respectively, of our total sales. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our top five customers accounted for approximately 16.1% and 12.7%, respectively, of our total
sales. 

13   

We operate and manage our business as a
single segment. We do not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis. 

Our principal executive offices are located
at 18 th  Floor, Jialong International Building, 19 Chaoyang Park Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100125, People s
Republic of China. Our corporate telephone number is (8610) 6598-3111 and our fax number is (8610) 6598-3222. We maintain a website

Recent Developments  

In October 2016, Guizhou Taibang completed
the registration with the local administration of industry and commerce in connection with the capital withdrawal by two former
minority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang for an aggregate consideration of RMB415.0 million (approximately $62.1 million) pursuant
to an agreement dated July 31, 2016. As part of the capital withdrawal plan, such minority shareholders also withdrew their existing
lawsuits involving Guizhou Taibang. Guizhou Taibang paid the first installment of RMB90 million (approximately US$13.5 million)
of the consideration to such former minority shareholders in August 2016 and will pay the balance of the consideration in accordance
with the agreement. As a result of the capital withdrawal, Guizhou Taibang has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Third Quarter Financial Performance Highlights  

The following are some financial highlights
for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

Results of Operations   

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015  

The following table sets forth key components
of our results of operations in thousands of U.S. dollars for the periods indicated. 

14   

Sales   

Our sales increased by $7.7 million, or
9.8%, to $86.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $78.8 million for the same period in 2015. In
RMB terms, our sales would have increased by 17.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in 2015. The increase in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to the price increase in
human tetanus immunoglobulin products and sales volume increases in human albumin products, and human tetanus immunoglobulin products,
partially offset by the decrease in sales volume of IVIG products. 

The following table summarizes the breakdown
of sales by significant types of product:  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015: 

the average price for our approved human albumin products, which accounted for 37.0% of our total
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased by 0.9% in RMB terms and decreased by 5.5% in USD terms; and   

the average price for our approved IVIG products, which accounted for 33.1% of our total sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased by 4.8% in RMB terms and decreased by 1.8% in USD terms.   

The average sales price of our human albumin
products and IVIG products increased in RMB terms for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in 2015 following the removal of the retail price ceiling for drug products effective on June 1, 2015, backed by the market demand. 

The sales volume of our products depends
on market demand and our production volume. The production volume of our human albumin products and IVIG products depends primarily
on the general plasma supply. The production volume of our hyper-immune products, which include human rabies immunoglobulin, human
hepatitis B immunoglobulin and human tetanus immunoglobulin products, is subject to the availabilities of specific vaccinated plasma
and our production capacity. The supply of specific vaccinated plasma requires several months of lead time. Our production facilities
currently can only accommodate the production of one type of hyper-immune products at any given time and we rotate the production
of different types of hyper-immune products from time to time in response to market demand. As such, the sales volume of any given
type of hyper-immune products may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. 

15   

The sales volume of our human albumin products
and IVIG products increased by 11.4% and decreased by 10.6%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. The sales growth of human albumin products was primarily attributable to the increased production volume
at Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang as a result of increased plasma supply volume. The decrease in the sales of IVIG products
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the depletion of IVIG
pastes we reserved from prior years that were processed and sold in 2015 and the allocation of more production facilities to human
tetanus immunoglobulin products, which had higher margin, in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The sales of other immunoglobulin products
increased significantly for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Other immunoglobulin
products accounted for 15.5% and 6.3% of our total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in both sales volume and sales price of human tetanus immunoglobulin
products. The sales volume of our human tetanus immunoglobulin increased by 49.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the same period in 2015. The average sales price of human tetanus immunoglobulin products increased significantly
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the significant market supply shortage
following the removal of the retail price ceiling for drug products effective on June 1, 2015. 

The sales increase of placenta polypeptide
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly in line with the sales volume of
placenta polypeptide, which increased by 9.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The sales increase of other products for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to the increase in sales volume
of human prothrombin complex concentrate, or PCC and factor VIII. Both our PCC and factor VIII experienced the sales ramp-up for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cost of sales and gross profit   

Our cost of sales was $27.6 million, or
31.9% of our sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $28.0 million, or 35.5% of our sales for the same
period in 2015. Our gross profit was $58.9 million and $50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing gross margins of 68.1% and 64.5%, respectively.  

Our cost of sales and gross margin are
affected by the product pricing, raw material costs, product mix, yields and manufactory efficiency. In an effort to increase plasma
collection volume and expand our donor base, we increased the nutrition fees paid to donors consistent with the industry practice.
We expected the nutrition fees to be paid to donors continue to increase as a result of improving living standards in China. Consequently,
future improvements on margins will need to be derived from increases in product pricing, product mix, yields and manufacturing
efficiency. 

The cost of sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 1.4% in USD terms, or increased by 5.7% in RMB terms, as compared to the same period in 2015.
The increase of cost of sales in RMB terms was mainly due to the increases in the sales volume of human albumin products and human
tetanus immunoglobulin products, which was partially offset by the decrease in the sales volume of IVIG products. The increase
of gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to the increase
of average sales price of certain plasma products, a more profitable product mix and a lower sales contribution from products made
from raw materials purchased from Xinjiang Deyuan Bioengineering Co., Ltd., or Xinjiang Deyuan, whose cost is moderately higher
than plasma from our own collection stations. 

16   

Operating expenses   

Our total operating expenses increased
by $3.3 million, or 20.9%, to $19.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $15.8 million for the same period
in 2015. As a percentage of sales, total expenses increased by 2.2% to 22.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from
20.0% for the same period in 2015. The increase of the total operating expenses was mainly due to the increase of general and administrative
expenses as discussed below. 

Selling expenses  

Our selling expenses increased by $0.3
million, or 11.1%, to $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.7 million for the same period in 2015.
As a percentage of sales, our selling expenses remained stable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015. The increase of the selling expenses was mainly in line with the sales growth in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 

General and administrative expenses  

Our general and administrative expenses
increased by $3.6 million, or 31.3%, to $15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $11.5 million for the
same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 2.9% to 17.5% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from 14.6% for the same period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly
due to the increase of share-based compensation expenses of $3.4 million. 

Research and development expenses  

Our research and development expenses decreased
by $0.6 million, or 37.5%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.6 million for the same period
in 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses was mainly due to the completion of certain research and development
programs and approximately $0.5 million in government grant which was recorded as deduction of research and development expenses
in the three months period ended September 30, 2016. 

Income tax   

17   

Our income tax expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 20.0%,
to $7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $6.0 million for the same period in 2015. Our effective income
tax rate remained at 16.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The statutory tax rate applicable to our major
operating subsidiaries in the PRC for 2016 and 2015 is 15.0%. 

Comparison of Nine months Ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

The following table sets forth key components
of our results of operations in thousands of U.S. dollars for the periods indicated. 

Sales   

Our sales increased by $35.3 million, or
15.5%, to $263.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $228.2 million for the same period in 2015.
In RMB terms, our sales would have increased by 23.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in 2015. Such increase of sales was mainly due to the price increase in human tetanus immunoglobulin products and sales volume
increases in human albumin products, human tetanus immunoglobulin products and placenta polypeptide products. 

The following table summarizes the breakdown
of sales by significant types of product: 

18   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

the average price for our approved human albumin products, which accounted for 38.9% of our total
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by 2.0% in RMB terms and decreased by 4.3% in USD terms , respectively;
and   

the average price for our approved IVIG products, which accounted for 35.5% of our total sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by 3.9% in RMB terms and decreased by 2.5% in USD terms, respectively.   

The average sales price of our human albumin
products and IVIG products increased in RMB terms for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in
2015 following the removal of the retail price ceiling for drug products effective on June 1, 2015, backed by the market demand. 

The sales volume of our human albumin products
and IVIG products increased by 25.0% and decreased by 3.7%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. The sales growth of human albumin products was primarily attributable to the increased production volume
at Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang as a result of increased plasma supply volume. The decrease in the sales of IVIG products
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the depletion of IVIG
pastes we reserved from prior years that were processed and sold in 2015 and the allocation of more production facilities to human
tetanus immunoglobulin products, which had higher margin, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The sales of other immunoglobulin products
increased by 92.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Other immunoglobulin products
accounted for 11.6% and 7.0% of our total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in both sales volume and sales price of human tetanus immunoglobulin products.
The sales volume of our human tetanus immunoglobulin increased by 64.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. The average sales price of human tetanus immunoglobulin products increased significantly for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the significant market supply shortage following
the removal of the retail price ceiling for drug products effective on June 1, 2015. 

The sales increase of placenta polypeptide
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly in line with the sales volume of
placenta polypeptide. The sales volume of placenta polypeptide increased by 28.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
primarily because we increased our market penetration into more hospitals through our improved sales capabilities. 

The sales increase of other products for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to the increase in sales volume
of PCC and factor VIII. Both our PCC and factor VIII experienced the sales ramp-up for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cost of sales and gross profit   

Our cost of sales was $93.2 million, or
35.4% of our sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $79.5 million, or 34.8% of our sales for the same
period in 2015. Our gross profit was $170.3 million and $148.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing gross margins of 64.6% and 65.2%, respectively.  

The increase in cost of sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to the increases in sales volume of human
albumin products, human tetanus immunoglobulin products and placenta polypeptide products. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage
of sales increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was mainly due to the higher
cost of plasma purchased from Xinjiang Deyuan, which was partially offset by the increase in the average sales price of certain
plasma products and a more profitable product mix. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the sales derived from the raw material purchased from Xinjiang Deyuan, whose cost is moderately higher than plasma
from our own collection stations, accounted for 10.8% and 1.3% of total plasma product sales, respectively. Excluding the sales
of products made from outsourced raw plasma, our gross margin would have been moderately higher for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which was mainly attributable to the increase of sales price and a more profitable
product mix. 

19   

Operating expenses   

Our total operating expenses increased
by $11.0 million, or 28.4%, to $49.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $38.7 million for the same period
in 2015. As a percentage of sales, total expenses increased by 1.9% to 18.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
17.0% for the same period in 2015. The increase of the total operating expenses was mainly in line with the increase of the general
and administrative expenses as discussed below. 

Selling expenses  

Our selling expenses increased by $0.1
million, or 1.4%, to $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $7.2 million for the same period in 2015.
As a percentage of sales, our selling expenses decreased by 0.4% to 2.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from 3.2%
for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the promotion activities on human rabies immunoglobulin products we carried out in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

General and administrative expenses  

Our general and administrative expenses
increased by $11.5 million, or 41.8%, to $39.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $27.5 million for the
same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 2.8% to 14.8% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, from 12.0% for the same period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly
due to the increase of share-based compensation expenses of $8.7 million and a prepayment impairment of $1.2 million. 

Research and development expenses  

Our research and development expenses decreased
by $0.6 million, or 15.0%, to $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $4.0 million for the same period
in 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received government grants of $0.7 million and $0.9 million,
respectively, and recognized the grants as a reduction of research and development expenses for each relevant period. 

Income tax   

20   

Our income tax expenses increased by $3.0
million, or 16.9%, to $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $17.8 million for the same period in 2015.
Our effective income tax rates were 16.4% and 15.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The statutory
tax rate applicable to our major operating subsidiaries in the PRC for 2016 and 2015 is 15.0%. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Impact  
   
 As all of our consolidated revenues and
consolidated costs of sales and majority of expenses are denominated in RMB, and all of our assets are denominated in RMB, except
certain cash balances, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations
in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency, and RMB. For details, see  Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk.  

Given our operations primarily in China,
we evaluate certain key items of our financial results on a local currency basis (i.e., in RMB) in addition to the reporting currency
(i.e., in USD). The local currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. We believe providing local currency information on such key items enhances the understanding of our financial results
and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. We calculate changes in local currency percentages by comparing financial
results denominated in RMB from period to period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

To date, we have financed our operations
primarily through cash flows from operations, augmented by bank borrowings and equity contributions by our stockholders. As of
September 30, 2016, we had $203.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits. 

The following table provides the summary
of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Operating Activities   

Net cash provided by operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $87.3 million, as compared to $72.3 million for the same period in 2015. The increase
in net cash provided by operating activities was largely consistent with the improvements in our results of operations and the
increase of net non-cash operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
Our cash inflows from operating activities are negatively affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory. 

Accounts receivable  

Our accounts receivable increased by $16.1
million and $16.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared with the balance as of December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The accounts receivable turnover days for plasma products were 45 days for the nine months periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. To enhance our business relationship with certain key customers, we granted longer credit terms to
certain qualified hospitals during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and granted special credit term extensions to certain
distributors of rabies immunoglobulin products in the same period of 2015. 

Inventories  

Our inventory cycle slowed down for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The inventory turnover days increased to 398 days
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 387 days for the same period in 2015, which was mainly due to an increase in
our inventory of raw materials purchased from Xinjiang Deyuan as of September 30, 2016 as compared to that balance as of September
30, 2015. 

21   

Net non-cash operating expenses  

Net non-cash operating expenses increased
by $7.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the increase
of share-based compensation expenses totaling $8.7 million. 

Investing Activities   

Our use of cash for investing activities
is primarily for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, and intangibles. 

Net cash used in investing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $44.1 million, as compared to $55.8 million for the same period in 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid $42.5 million and $30.5 million, respectively, for the acquisition of property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets and land use rights for Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we granted loans of $12.3 million and $28.5 million, respectively, to Xinjiang Deyuan. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received a refund of $10.3 million from the local government of Guiyang with respect to
deposits of land use rights. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $2.5 million government grants related
to property, plant and equipment. 

Financing Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $19.6 million, as compared to $49.7 million for the same period in 2015. The net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly consisted of the proceeds of $3.2 million
from stock option exercised and the maturity of a $37.8 million time deposit as a security for a bank loan that was fully repaid
in June 2015, partially offset by a dividend of $7.9 million paid to the minority shareholder by Shandong Taibang and payment of
$13.5 million to the former minority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in connection with their capital withdrawal from Guizhou Taibang.
The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly consisted of net proceeds of
$80.6 million from a follow-on offering of our stock in June 2015, proceeds of $63.2 million from the maturity of deposits used
as security for bank loans and proceeds of $7.2 million from stock options exercised, partially offset by repayments of bank loans
of $97.9 million and a dividend of $3.7 million held in escrow by a trial court in connection with disputes with a former minority
shareholder of Guizhou Taibang. 

The remaining balance of the consideration
payable to former minority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in connection with their capital withdrawal in Guizhou Taibang, will
be paid in accordance with the relevant agreement. 

Our management believes that we have sufficient
cash on hand and will continue to have positive cash inflow for our operations from the sale of our products in the PRC market. 

Obligations under Material Contracts  

The following table sets forth our material contractual obligations
as of September 30, 2016: 

The remaining balance of the consideration payable
to former minority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in connection with their capital withdrawal in Guizhou Taibang, will be
paid in accordance with the relevant agreement. 

Seasonality of Our Sales  

Our results of operations and operating
cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market
opportunities or new product introductions. 

Inflation   

Inflation does not materially affect our
business or the results of our operations. 

22   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Critical accounting policies are those
we believe are most important to portraying our financial conditions and results of operations and also require the greatest amount
of subjective or complex judgments by management. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies
may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been
no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 3.  
      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

Our operations are carried out in the PRC
and we are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and
Western Europe. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic
and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC economy. Our results may be adversely affected by changes
in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad,
and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. 

Interest Rate Risk  

We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily
with respect to our bank loans. We have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.
We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. However, our future
interest expenses may increase due to changes in market interest rates. 

Management monitors the banks  prime
rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of
funds. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk. 

Foreign Exchange Risk  

All of our consolidated revenues and consolidated
costs of sales and majority of expenses are denominated in RMB. All of our assets are denominated in RMB, except certain cash balances.
However, our reporting currency is U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results
of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against the
U.S. dollars, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline.
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the
average exchange rates and shareholders  equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments
are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders 
equity. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. 

RMB is currently freely convertible under
the  current account,  which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under
the  capital account,  which includes foreign direct investment. In addition, beginning in July 2005, China reformed
its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference
to a basket of major foreign currencies. Under the managed floating exchange rate regime, RMB is no longer pegged to U.S. dollars.
The People s Bank of China announces the closing prices of foreign currencies such as U.S. dollars traded against RMB in
the inter-bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day, and makes such prices the central
parity for trading against RMB on the following business day. On March 17, 2014, the People s Bank of China announced a policy
to further expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against U.S. dollars in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange
market to 2.0%. In the long term, RMB may appreciate or depreciate more significantly in value against U.S. dollars or other foreign
currencies, depending on the market supply and demand with reference to a basket of major foreign currencies. On August 10, 2015,
the People s Bank of China announced that it had changed the calculation method for RMB s daily central parity exchange
rate against U.S. dollars, which resulted in an approximately 2.0% depreciation of RMB on that day. RMB continued to experience
an approximately 8% depreciation against U.S. dollars throughout the remainder of 2015 and up to the date of this report. 

Account Balances  

We maintain balances at financial institutions
which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for the banks located in the United States,
Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board insured limits for the banks located in Hong Kong, or China Deposit Insurance Scheme insured
limits for the banks located in the PRC. Total cash at banks and restricted cash deposits as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 amounted to $203.2 million and $182.3 million, respectively, $2.5 million and $3.0 million of which are covered by insurance,
respectively. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and we do not believe that we are exposed to any significant
risks on our cash at banks and deposits. 

23   

Inflation  

Inflationary factors such as increases
in the cost of our sales and overhead costs may adversely affect our results of operations. Although we do not believe that inflation
has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may
have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 

Market for Human Albumin and IVIG  

Our two major products, human albumin and
IVIG, accounted for 38.9% and 35.5% of the total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. If the market
demands for human albumin or IVIG cannot be sustained in the future or if there is substantial price decrease in either or both
products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

ITEM 4.   
      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management
has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David (Xiaoying)
Gao and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ming Yang, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Gao and Mr. Yang concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 

  OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.  
      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

From time to time, we may become involved
in various lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these, or other matters, may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Other
than the legal proceedings set forth below, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe
will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Dispute with Jie an over Certain Capital Injection
into Guizhou Taibang   

In May 2007, a 91% majority of Guizhou
Taibang s shareholders approved a plan to raise additional capital from qualified strategic investors through the issuance
of an additional 20,000,000 shares of Guizhou Taibang. The plan required all existing Guizhou Taibang shareholders to waive their
rights of first refusal to subscribe for the additional shares. The remaining 9% minority shareholder of Guizhou Taibang s
shares, Guizhou Jie an Company, or Jie an, did not support the plan and did not waive its right of first refusal. In
May 2007, Guizhou Taibang signed an Equity Purchase Agreement with certain alleged strategic investors (who concealed their background),
pursuant to which such investors agreed to invest an aggregate of RMB51.0 million (approximately $7.6 million) in exchange for
21.4% of Guizhou Taibang s equity interests. Such Equity Purchase Agreement was not approved or ratified by over two-thirds
supermajority of Guizhou Taibang s shareholders, which approval or ratification is required under the PRC Company Law. At
the same time, as an existing shareholder, Jie an also subscribed for 1,800,000 shares, representing its pro rata share of
the 20,000,000 shares being offered. In total, Guizhou Taibang received RMB51.0 million (approximately $7.6 million) from the investors
and RMB6.5 million (approximately $1.0 million) from Jie an. 

24   

In June 2007, Jie an brought a lawsuit
against Guizhou Taibang, alleging that it had a right to acquire the 18,200,000 shares offered to the investors under the Equity
Purchase Agreement. The trial court denied Jie an s request, and the PRC Supreme Court ultimately sustained the original
ruling in May 2009 and denied the rights of first refusal of Jie an over the 18,200,000 shares. 

During the second quarter of 2010, Jie an
requested that Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of additional capital injection with the local administration of
industry and commerce, or AIC. Guizhou Taibang s board of directors withheld its required ratification of Jie an s
request, pending the outcome of the ongoing litigation. In March 2012, Jie an brought another lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang
for refusing to register the shares. In July 2013, the trial court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Jie an
did not appeal the dismissal. 

In December 2013, Jie an brought
a third lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang, requesting Guizhou Taibang to register 1.8 million shares under its name with the local
AIC. In July 2014, the trial court denied Jie an s request to register such shares. Despite the denial of Jie an s
share registration request, the trial court, however, in its ruling, ordered Guizhou Taibang to pay accumulated dividends of RMB13.8
million (approximately $2.1 million) associated with these shares and the related interest expenses to Jie an. Guizhou Taibang
and Jie an subsequently filed a cross-appeal. In December 2014, the appellate court ruled in favor of Jie an supporting
its request to register 1.8 million shares and ordered Guizhou Taibang to pay Jie an its share of accumulated dividends of
RMB18.3 million (approximately $2.7 million) associated with these shares plus the related interest expenses to Jie an. In
the first half of 2015, Guizhou Taibang paid an aggregate of RMB22.6 million (approximately $3.4 million) to the trial court held
in escrow pending further appeal of this case. In June 2015, Guizhou Taibang appealed to the High Court of Guizhou, which overruled
the decision of the appellate court and remanded the case to the trial court for retrial in September 2015. In August 2016, the
trial court granted Jie an s petition to withdraw the lawsuit as Jie an sought to withdraw its capital contribution
in Guizhou Taibang pursuant to an agreement dated July 31, 2016. The funds held in escrow will be credited to the consideration
payable to Jie an for the capital withdrawal. 

In November 2013, Guizhou Taibang held
a shareholders meeting and the shareholders passed resolutions, or the November 2013 Resolutions, that, inter alia, (i) determined
that it was no longer necessary for Guizhou Taibang to obtain additional capital from investors; (ii) rejected Jie an s
request that Jie an subscribe for additional shares of Guizhou Taibang alone and one or more other shareholders reduce their
shareholding in Guizhou Taibang; and (iii) approved the issuance of a total of 20,000,000 new shares to all existing shareholders
on a pro rata basis. Jie an subsequently filed a fourth lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang in December 2013, requesting that
the court declare the November 2013 Resolutions void. Both the trial court and the appellate court denied Jie an s
request. 

In March 2014, Guizhou Taibang held another
shareholders meeting and the shareholders passed resolutions, or the March 2014 Resolutions, that, inter alia, re-calculated the
ownership percentage in Guizhou Taibang based on the November 2013 Resolutions and the additional capital injections from existing
shareholders. Guizhou Taibang subsequently updated the registration with the local AIC regarding the additional capital injections
in August 2014. In September 2014, Jie an and Shenzhen Yigong Shengda Technology Co., Ltd., or Yigong Shengda, another minority
shareholder of Guizhou Taibang, filed a lawsuit against Guizhou Taibang, requesting that the court declare both the November 2013
Resolutions and the March 2014 Resolutions void and instruct Guizhou Taibang to withdraw the AIC registration. In November 2014,
the trial court suspended this case pending the final outcome of the third lawsuit filed by Jie an. In October 2015, the
trial court denied their request. In May 2016, the appellate court vacated the trial court s decision to uphold Guizhou Taibang s
shareholders resolution, and remanded the case for retrial. In August 2016, the trial court granted the petitions by Jie an
and Yigong Shengda to withdraw the lawsuit as Jie an and Yigong Shengda sought to withdraw their respective capital contributions
in Guizhou Taibang pursuant to an agreement dated July 31, 2016. 

On July 31, 2016, Guiyang Dalin Biologic
Technologies Co., Ltd., or Guiyang Dalin, Guizhou Taibang, Jie an and Yigong Shengda entered into an agreement, pursuant
to which Jie an and Yigong Shengda agreed to withdraw their respective capital contributions in Guizhou Taibang for an aggregate
consideration of RMB415.0 million (approximately $62.1 million). In August 2016, Guizhou Taibang paid the first installment of
RMB90.0 million (approximately $13.5 million) of the consideration to Jie an and Yigong Shengda. Guizhou Taibang completed
the AIC registration for the foregoing capital withdrawal in October 2016 and will pay the balance of the consideration to Jie an
and Yigong Shengda in accordance with the agreement. As a result of the capital withdrawal, Guiyang Dalin has become the sole shareholder
of Guizhou Taibang. 

As of September 30, 2016, Guizhou Taibang
had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to Jie an in the amounts of RMB5.0 million (approximately $0.8 million) as
received funds in respect of the 1.8 million shares in dispute, RMB1.4 million (approximately $0.2 million) for the over-paid subscription
price paid by Jie an and RMB3.9 million (approximately $0.6 million) for the accrued interest. 

Dispute with Certain Individual Investor
over Certain Capital Injection into Guizhou Taibang   

In part due to the invalidity of the Equity
Purchase Agreement with certain alleged strategic investors in May 2007, which was never approved or ratified by Guizhou Taibang s
shareholders, such investors  equity ownership in Guizhou Taibang and the related increase in registered capital of Guizhou
Taibang have never been registered with the local AIC. In January 2010, one individual among such investors brought a lawsuit against
Guizhou Taibang requesting to register his 14.35% ownership interest in Guizhou Taibang with the local AIC and seeking the distribution
of his share of Guizhou Taibang s dividends declared since 2007. 

25   

In October 2010, the trial court denied
such individual investor s right as shareholder of Guizhou Taibang and his entitlement to share the dividends, which ruling
was reaffirmed after a re-trial by the same trial court in December 2012. After such ruling, Guizhou Taibang attempted to return
the originally received fund of RMB34.2 million (approximately $5.1 million) to such investor by wiring the fund back to his bank
account but was unable to do so due to the closure of his bank account. Another investor, however, accepted the returned fund of
RMB11.2 million (approximately $1.7 million) from Guizhou Taibang in November 2010. In 2013, the same individual investor appealed
the case to the PRC Supreme Court, which also denied his claims for shareholder status in Guizhou Taibang and the related dividend
distribution and accrued interest in September 2013. Such investor subsequently attempted to seek a re-trial by the PRC Supreme
Court, which request was denied by the PRC Supreme Court in January 2014. He then applied to the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to request
for a review of the PRC Supreme Court s decision and seek an appeal by the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to the PRC Supreme Court
for an ultimate re-trial on his behalf. In July 2015, the PRC Supreme Procuratorate rejected his request for review. 

As of September 30, 2016, Guizhou Taibang
had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to the investors of RMB34.2 million (approximately $5.1 million) as originally received
funds from such individual investor in respect of the shares in dispute, RMB18.9 million (approximately $2.8 million) for the interest
expenses, and RMB0.3 million (approximately $51,155) for the 1% penalty imposed by the Equity Purchase Agreement for any breach
in the event that Guizhou Taibang is required to return the original investment amount to such investor.

2015. We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially

We have not sold any equity securities
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that were not previously disclosed in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or a current

        OTHER INFORMATION.   

Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r)
of the Exchange Act  

Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange
Act, we may be required to disclose in our annual and quarterly reports to the SEC whether we or any of our  affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities targeted
by U.S. economic sanctions. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted
in compliance with applicable law. Because the SEC defines the term  affiliate  broadly, it includes any entity under
common  control  with us (and the term  control  is also construed broadly by the SEC). 

The description of the activities below
has been provided to us by Warburg Pincus LLC, or WP, affiliates of which (i) designated a member of our board of directors, who
resigned in August 2016, and (ii) beneficially own more than 10.0% of the equity interests of, and have the right to designate
members of the board of directors of Santander Asset Management Investment Holdings Limited, or SAMIH. SAMIH may therefore be deemed
to be under common  control  with us; however, this statement is not meant to be an admission that common control exists. 

26   

The disclosure below relates solely to
activities conducted by SAMIH and its affiliates. The disclosure does not relate to any activities conducted by us or by WP and
does not involve our or WP s management. Neither we nor WP has had any involvement in or control over the disclosed activities,
and neither we nor WP has independently verified or participated in the preparation of the disclosure. Neither we nor WP is representing
as to the accuracy or completeness of the disclosure nor do we or WP undertake any obligation to correct or update it. 

We understand that one or more SEC-reporting
affiliates of SAMIH intends to disclose in its next annual or quarterly SEC report that: 

(a)  Santander UK plc ( Santander UK ) holds two savings accounts and one current account
for two customers resident in the United Kingdom ( UK ) who are currently designated by the United States ( US )
under the Specially Designated Global Terrorist ( SDGT ) sanctions program. Revenues and profits generated by Santander
UK on these accounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were negligible relative to the overall revenues and profits of
Banco Santander SA.   

(b)  Santander UK held a savings account for a customer resident in the UK who is currently designated
by the US under the SDGT sanctions program. The savings account was closed on July 26, 2016. Revenue generated by Santander UK
on this account in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was negligible relative to the overall revenues of Banco Santander
SA.   

(c)  Santander UK holds two frozen current accounts for two UK nationals who are designated by the US
under the SDGT sanctions program. The accounts held by each customer have been frozen since their designation and have remained
frozen through the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The accounts are in arrears ( 1,844.73 in debit combined) and are
currently being managed by Santander UK Collections   Recoveries department. Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK
on these accounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were negligible relative to the overall revenues and profits of Banco
Santander SA.   

(d)  Santander UK holds three current accounts and a savings account for two customers resident in the
UK who are currently designated by the US under the Transnational Criminal Organizations ( TCO ) sanctions program.
Revenues and profits generated by Santander UK on these accounts in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were negligible relative
to the overall revenues and profits of Banco Santander SA.   

(e)  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Santander UK had an OFAC match on
a power of attorney account. A party listed on the account is currently designated by the US under the SDGT sanctions program and
the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations. The power of attorney was removed from the account on July 29, 2016. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, related revenues and profits generated by Santander UK were negligible relative to the overall
revenues and profits of Banco Santander SA.

1.    
       EFFECTIVENESS OF AGREEMENT AND EFFECTIVE DATE    
 
 This Agreement shall
become effective retrospectively as of August 31, 2016. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term   Effective Date  
means August 31, 2016. 

2.    
       EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES    

2.1  General .
The Executive will perform such duties and services for the Company as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors
(the  Board ) and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Executive agrees to serve the Company faithfully
and to the best of his ability under the direction of the Board and to carry out the functions typically performed by a Chief Financial
Officer. The Executive further agrees to perform such duties in accordance with the general fiduciary duties of officers and directors
arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Executive is expected and required to devote substantially all of his time
and attention during normal business hours to the affairs of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. 

2.2  Term of Employment .
The Executive s employment under this Agreement will commence as of the Effective Date and will terminate on the first year

further action of either party for additional one (1) year periods unless written notice of either party s intention not
to extend has been given to the other party hereto at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then effective term
(the initial term and any extensions thereof, the   Term of Employment  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Executive s employment may be terminated during the Term of Employment as provided in  Section 5  below. 

2.3  Reimbursement

3.1  Base Salary .
From the Effective Date, the Executive will be entitled to receive a base salary (  Base Salary  ) at a rate of
US$250,000 per annum, payable in accordance with the Company s payroll practices and applicable law. If the rate of Base

3.2  Annual Review .
The Executive s Base Salary will be reviewed by the Board, based upon the Executive s performance not less than annually. 

3.3  Bonus Compensation .

Executive from time to time by the Board in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board. 

3.4  Additional
Compensation . The Company may, in its sole discretion, award the Executive additional equity-based compensation. The Executive

the event that they are not used by the Executive). All annual leave days will be taken at times mutually agreed by the Executive
and the Company and will be subject to the business needs of the Company. If, however, in any calendar year during the Term of
Employment, the Executive is unable to take any annual leave due to the business needs of the Company, the Company, in its discretion,
shall either pay the Executive the equivalent of 15 working days, or permit the Executive to carry such leave over into the following
calendar year.

5.4  Change of Control. 
In the event of a Change of Control, the Company shall (i) assign this Agreement and all rights and obligations under it to any
business entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Company s business through that merger or combination or
sale of assets, or (ii) on at least thirty (30) days  prior written notice to the Executive, terminate this Agreement upon
the effective date of such Change of Control. In the event that the Company terminates Executive s employment pursuant to
this Section 5.4, the Executive shall be entitled to receive, upon termination an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of the Executive s
then current Base Salary paid in eighteen (18) equal monthly installments, subject to  Sections 5.7  and  5.8 .

(a) The consummation
of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;

to the merger or consolidation remain outstanding or are converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or parent so
that they continue to represent at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of
the surviving entity (or parent) outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or 

(c) A change in the
composition of the Board, which results in fewer than a majority of the directors being  Incumbent Directors.  For
purpose of this provision,   Incumbent Directors   shall mean directors who either (i) are directors as of the
Effective Date, or (ii) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority
of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transactions described above or in connection with
an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to election. 

5.5  Voluntary Resignation .
If the Executive terminates his employment voluntarily, then the Executive shall not be entitled to receive payment of any severance
benefits. The Company further shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to make the Executive s termination effective
at any time prior to the end of notice period required under  Section 5.1.2  as long as the Company provides Executive with
all compensation to which he would be entitled for continuing employment through the last day of the notice period. Thereafter,
all obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall cease. 

5.6  Cause .
Termination for   Cause   means termination of the Executive s employment by the Company because of: 

(i) any act or omission
that constitutes a breach by the Executive of any of his obligations under this Agreement or any Company policy or procedure and
failure to cure such breach after notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure, such breach; 

(ii) the continued
willful failure or refusal of the Executive to substantially perform the duties reasonably required of him as an employee of the
Company; 

(iii) an alleged act
(with credible substantiated evidence) of moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud or violation of law (whether or not connected to the
Company or its Affiliates (as defined in  Section 8.1 )) by, or criminal conviction of, the Executive which in the determination
of the Board (in its sole discretion) would render his continued employment by the Company damaging or detrimental to the Company
or its Affiliates in any way; or 

(iv) any misappropriation
of Company property by the Executive. 

5.7  Release of
Claims . The receipt of any severance payments pursuant to Sections 5.3 or 5.4 of this Agreement is subject to the Executive
signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the   Release  ),
which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the 60 th  day following the date of Executive s termination
of employment (the   Release Deadline  ), and if not, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments
or benefits under this Agreement. In addition, no severance payments or benefits will be paid or provided until the Release actually
becomes effective. To the extent that any severance payments or benefits constitute Deferred Payments (as defined below), severance
payments shall commence on the 61 st  day following Executive s termination of employment, subject to Section 5.8. 

- 3 -  

5.8  Section 409A .
The Company intends that all severance payments made under this Agreement comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any guidance promulgated thereunder (  Section 409A  )
so that none of the payments or benefits will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities
or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to so comply or be exempt. Specifically, the severance benefits are intended to be
exempt from the requirements of Section 409A under the separation pay plan exception set forth under Section 409A. If, at the time
of the Executive s separation from service, the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section
409A and the severance benefits payable under this Agreement, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation
benefits, are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the   Deferred Payments  ), payment
of such Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section
409A, which generally means that Executive will begin to receive payments on the date 6 months and 1 day following the Executive s
separation from service. The Company and the Executive agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement
and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or
income recognition prior to actual payment to you under Section 409A. In no event will the Company reimburse the Executive for
any taxes that may be imposed on Executive as a result of Section 409A. 

6.    
       DEATH OR DISABILITY    

In the event of termination
of employment by reason of non-work-related death or Permanent Disability, the Executive (or his estate, as applicable) will be
entitled to the Base Salary and benefits determined under  Sections 3 and 4  through the date of termination. In the event
of termination of employment by reason of work related death or Permanent Disability, the Executive (or his estate, as applicable)
will be entitled to the greater of (i) Base Salary and benefits determined under Sections 3 and 4 through the date of termination,
or (ii) the minimum compensation permitted by applicable law. Other benefits will be determined in accordance with the benefit
plans maintained by the Company, and the Company will have no further obligation hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement,   Permanent
Disability   means a physical or mental disability or infirmity of the Executive that prevents the normal performance
of substantially all his duties as an employee of the Company, which disability or infirmity exists for any continuous period of
180 days.

7.1  to the extent the Executive is required to disclose under any applicable laws, regulations or directives of any government
agency, tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the matter or under subpoena or other process of law provided that the Executive
provides the Company with prompt written notice of such requirement. For the purposes of this Agreement,   Affiliate  
means, with respect to any person or entity, any other person or entity that is directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,

the surviving entity (or parent) outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or

or its Affiliates in any way; or 

(iv) any misappropriation
of Company property by the Executive. 

5.7  Release of
Claims . The receipt of any severance payments pursuant to Sections 5.3 or 5.4 of this Agreement is subject to the Executive
signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the   Release  ),
which must become effective and irrevocable no later than the 60 th  day following the date of Executive s termination
of employment (the   Release Deadline  ), and if not, the Executive will forfeit any right to severance payments
or benefits under this Agreement. In addition, no severance payments or benefits will be paid or provided until the Release actually

or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to so comply or be exempt. Specifically, the severance benefits are intended to be
exempt from the requirements of Section 409A under the separation pay plan exception set forth under Section 409A. If, at the time
of the Executive s separation from service, the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section
409A and the severance benefits payable under this Agreement, when considered together with any other severance payments or separation
benefits, are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A (together, the   Deferred Payments  ), payment
of such Deferred Payments will be delayed to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the additional tax imposed under Section
409A, which generally means that Executive will begin to receive payments on the date 6 months and 1 day following the Executive s
separation from service. The Company and the Executive agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement
and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or
income recognition prior to actual payment to you under Section 409A. In no event will the Company reimburse the Executive for
any taxes that may be imposed on Executive as a result of Section 409A.

entitled to the Base Salary and benefits determined under  Sections 3 and 4  through the date of termination. In the event
of termination of employment by reason of work related death or Permanent Disability, the Executive (or his estate, as applicable)
will be entitled to the greater of (i) Base Salary and benefits determined under Sections 3 and 4 through the date of termination,
