          The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements                                                                    5          ALL MARKETING SOLUTIONS, INC.

CONDENSED INTERIM STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS     Unaudited              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements                                        6          ALL MARKETING SOLUTIONS, INC.     (FKA Patents Professional, Inc.)         NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         September 30, 2015          NOTE 1     CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2015, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.       Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company   s December 31, 2014 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2015 and the same period last year are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.         NOTE 2     GOING CONCERN         The Company   s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company has a working capital deficit of $286,888, an accumulated deficit of $1,352,208. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.  The Company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder   s shares.       In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management   s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.       The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.         NOTE 3 - IMPAIRMENT OF FIXED ASSET         On January 8, 2014, the Company, completed the acquisition of, and exclusive rights in and to, computer source code related to software applications for the management of Internet cloud storage services in exchange for 4,000,000 shares of Common Restricted Stock at a value of $0.25 per share for the source and object code forms of the software applications.       Within the guidelines of the ASC, it was deemed that this acquisition of an intangible fixed asset of $1,000,000, did not pass the quantitative test of impairment and it has accordingly been written down to a zero balance.                        7           NOTE 4     CAPITAL STOCK         The Company   s capitalization is 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.  No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.       On January 8, 2014, the Company issued 4,000,000 common shares in exchange for a capital acquisition, at $0.25 per share.        On May 15, 2014, the Company issued 150,000 common shares for cash of $60,000.        As of September 30, 2015, the Company has not granted any stock options and has not recorded any stock-based compensation.       As of September 30, 2015, 104,710,000 (104,710,000 as of December 31, 2014) common shares were issued and outstanding.             NOTE 5     LOAN PAYABLE     RELATED PARTY LOANS         At September 30, 2015 the Company received a loan from related parties totaling $146,314 ($163,403 at December 31, 2014) of which $27,600 ($26,100 at December 31, 2014) were for expenses paid on behalf of the company by a vendor and $113,600 ($86,611 at December 31, 2014) were for expenses paid on behalf of a shareholder. These amounts are payable on demand and without interest.             NOTE 6 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS         The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company   s financial statement.             NOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS         The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were available to be issued and has determined that there are no further events to disclose.                                                                                                     8          Item 2.  Management   s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        This section of this Form 10-Q includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.        Results of Operations        For the three month period ended September 30, 2015 we had no revenue. Expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $2,850 resulting in a Net loss of $2,850 compared to expenses totaling $78,400 and a net loss of $78,400 for the three month period ended September 30, 2014. The Net Loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 is a result of Office and general expense of $600 comprised primarily of web site maintenance expense, Professional Fees of $2,250 comprised primarily of accounting expense and related party expense of $Nil.  The Net Loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2014 was a result of Office and general expense of $75,400 comprised primarily of software development expense of $75,000, Professional Fees of $1,500 comprised primarily of accounting expense and related party expense of $1,500 comprised primarily of accounting expense.       For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 we had no revenue. Expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $11,399 resulting in a Net loss of $11,399 compared to expenses totaling $1,171,030 and a net loss of $1,171,030 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2014. The Net Loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 is a result of Office and general expense of $3,899 comprised primarily of Web site maintenance, Transfer fees and filing fees, Professional Fees of $7,500 comprised primarily of accounting expense and related party expense of $Nil.  The Net Loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2014 was a result of Impairment of fixed asset expense of $1,000,000, Office and general expense of $162,030 comprised primarily of Software development expense, Transfer fees and filing fees, Professional Fees of $4,500 comprised primarily of accounting expense and related part expense of $4,500 comprised primarily of accounting expense.        Capital Resources and Liquidity        Our auditors have issued a    going concern    opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our sole Officer and Director, our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year.       As of September 30, 2015, we had $626 in cash as compared to $626 in cash at December 31, 2014. The funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the planned operations of the Company and maintain a reporting status. Our current cash holdings will not satisfy our liquidity requirements and we will require additional financing to pursue our planned business activities.  We previously registered 4,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale to the public.  Our registration statement became effective on November 1, 2011 and we are still in the process of seeking additional equity financing in the form of private placements to fund our operations over the next 12 months.         Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.       We do not anticipate researching and releasing any further features to our software nor do we foresee the purchase or sale of any significant equipment. We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees.        Off-balance sheet arrangements        Other than the situation described in the section titled Capital Recourses and Liquidity, the company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the company   s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term    off-balance sheet arrangement    generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.        9          Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.    Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.         Disclosure Controls and Procedures         Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.        In connection with this quarterly report, as required by Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company's disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company's management, including our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that subject to the inherent limitations noted in this Part II, Item 9A(T) as of September 30, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.    PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        Currently we are not involved in any pending litigation or legal proceeding.    Item 1A. Risk Factors.        We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Securities and Use of Proceeds.        None    Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.        None    Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
