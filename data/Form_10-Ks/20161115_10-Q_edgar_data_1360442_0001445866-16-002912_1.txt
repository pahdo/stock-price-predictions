1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates:

Presentation of Interim Information:

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Cannabis Sativa, Inc., formerly named Ultra Sun Corp. ("we", "us", "our" or "Company"), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and should be read in conjunction with the annual report on Form 10-k filed with the SEC May 6, 2016.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted, as permitted by the SEC, although we believe the disclosures, which are made, are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2016, and the results of our operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

Interim results are subject to significant seasonal variations and the results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

Nature of Corporation:

We were incorporated under the laws of Nevada in November 2004 as Ultra Sun Corp. On November 13, 2013, we changed our name to Cannabis Sativa, Inc.   Our wholly-owned subsidiary Kush was acquired by us in June 2014 in exchange for shares of our common stock.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. ("Wild Earth") was acquired by us in July 2013 in exchange for shares of our common stock.  The acquisition of Kush resulted in a change of control of the Company and at or after the closing of the acquisition of Kush, the persons designated by Kush became the officers and directors of the Company.  From our inception through September 30, 2013 we were engaged in the tanning salon business and operated a tanning salon in Saratoga Springs, Utah under the name "Sahara Sun Tanning."  As a result of our acquisition of Wild Earth in July 2013, we became engaged in the herbal skin care products business.  On September 30, 2013 we sold the assets of the tanning salon business to a third party.  As a result of our acquisition of Kush in June 2014, along with our Wild Earth operations we are now engaged in the developing and promoting of natural cannabis products.  On November 2, 2015, Kush was spun out of the Company.  On August 8, 2016 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with iBudtender Inc. to purchase 50.1% of iBudtender Inc.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounts Receivable:

We estimate credit loss reserves for accounts receivable on an individual receivable basis. A specific impairment allowance reserve is established based on expected future cash flows and the financial condition of the debtor.  We charge off customer balances in part or in full when it is more likely than not that we will not collect that amount of the balance due.  We consider any balance unpaid after the contract payment period to be past due.  At September 30, 2016 the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of $-0-.

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Inventory:

The Company calculates inventory using the average cost method to value inventory.  Inventory cost includes those costs directly attributable to the product before sale.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable approximate fair value given their short term nature or effective interest rates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

For financial accounting purposes, cash and cash equivalents are considered to be all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three (3) months or less.

Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and contains no dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no outstanding potentially dilutive securities.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

Digital Currencies Translations and Re-measurements

The Company accounts for digital currencies, which it considers to be an operating asset, at their initial cost and subsequently re-measures the carrying amounts of digital currencies it owns at each reporting date based on their current fair value. The changes in the fair value of digital currencies are included as a component of income or loss from operations. The Company currently classifies digital currencies as a current asset. The Company obtains the equivalency rate of hempcoins to bitcoins to USD from Coinmarketcap.com. The equivalency rate of garycoins to bitcoins to USD is obtained from C-cex.com and Coinmarketcap.com.  The equivalency rate obtained from Coinmarket represents a generally well recognized quoted price in an active market for bitcoins, which market and related database are accessible to the Company on an ongoing basis. The Bitcoin Price Index was $605.64 as of September 30, 2016.

Intangible Assets:

Intangible assets are comprised of patents, trademarks, the Company's "CBDS.com" website domain and intellectual property rights.  The patent is being amortized using the straight-line method over its economic life, which is estimated to be twenty (20) years.  The trademark, which is still in the application phase, is expected to have an indefinite useful life.  The CBDS.com website is expected to have an indefinite useful life.  The intellectual property rights are being amortized using the straight-line month over its economic life, which is estimated to be (20) years.

Income Taxes:

The Company estimates the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and records a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, we refine the estimates of the year's taxable income as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process can result in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, the Company adjusts the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate. Significant judgment may be required in determining the Company's effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.

The effective income tax rate of 0% for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 differed from the statutory rate, due primarily to net operating losses incurred by the Company in the respective periods.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 a tax benefit of approximately $126,676 would have been generated.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 a tax benefit of approximately $833,206 would have been generated.  However, all benefits have been fully offset through an allowance account due to the uncertainty of the utilization of the net operating losses. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had net operating losses of approximately $844,505 resulting in a deferred tax asset of approximately $126,676.  As of September 30, 2015 the Company had net operating losses of approximately $5,554,706  resulting in a deferred tax asset of approximately $833,206.

The Company has established a valuation allowance in the full amount of the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of the utilization of operating losses in future periods.

Pending Accounting Pronouncements:

There have been no recent accounting pronouncements issued which are expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

2.  Eden Holdings LLC

During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Company created Eden Holdings LLC.  The purpose of the entity is to hold the intellectual property of Cannabis Sativa, Inc.  As of September 30, 2016 there has been no activity in the LLC.

3.   Fair Value Measurements

We adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information.  These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision.  The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, inventory, notes payable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities approximate fair value given their short term nature or effective interest rates.  We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  As of September 30, 2016, assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

4.  Hempcoins

At September 30, 2016, the Company has possession of 110,000,000 hempcoins.  Hempcoins are reported as digital currency.  Every 10 hempcoins are backed by 1 share of Rocky Mountain Inc (RMTN).  At September 30, 2016 the value of hempcoins was $35,309 computed by converting first to bitcoin and then to US Dollars. (See Note 1).

5.  Garycoins

At September 30, 2016, the Company has possession of 450,002,549 garycoins.  Garycoins are reported as digital currency.  At September 30, 2016 the value of garycoins was $5,931 computed by converting to a bitcoin value in US Dollars. (See Note 1).

6.  Related Parties

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company received additional short-term advances from related parties and officers of the Company to cover operating expenses in the amount of $251,300.  As of September 30, 2016, net advances to the Company were $336,117.  The Company has imputed interest on these sums at the rate of 5% per annum and has recorded interest expense related to these balances in the amount of $3,509.  Because the related parties do not expect the imputed interest to be repaid, the interest has been recorded as a contribution of capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Company also has a $15,000 note receivable from a related party.  Payment is not expected currently.

10.  Going Concern Considerations

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses since inception. As reported in the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise adequate capital to fund operating losses until it is able to engage in profitable business operations. To the extent financing is not available, the Company may not be able to, or may be delayed in, developing its services and meeting its obligations. The Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to evaluate additional means of financing in order to satisfy its working capital and other cash requirements. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

11.   Other Matters

The Company has also submitted its application to be listed on NASDAQ.

12.   Subsequent Events

The Company approved a Private Placement Memorandum on October 14, 2016.  The total offering proceeds will be $1,500,000 by offering 625,000 of the Company's stock at $2.40 per share. Each unit will consist of 1 (one) share of common stock and 1 (one) warrant.  Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase 1(one) common share at the exercise price of $4.00.  The offering will terminate on December 14, 2016 but can be extended for up to 60 additional days.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,707 and $6,378, respectively.  Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,243 and $13,172, respectively. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5,464 and $(6,794), respectively.  Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $(464,467) compared to net loss of $(1,779,316) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in net loss is due to the decrease in operating expenses for the third fiscal quarter of 2016 compared to the third fiscal quarter of 2015 for the reasons discussed below.

Total operating expenses were $456,844 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,762,707 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The significant decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributable to non-cash transactions involving the issuance of capital stock in exchange for services and the extinguishment of debt that took place in the third fiscal quarter of 2015.   Since similar transactions did not take place during the second fiscal quarter of 2016, operating expenses were more typical of actual operating expenses.   Other general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional fees, payroll expenses, rent and transfer agent fees.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $24,243 and $8,096, respectively. The increase in revenue was a result of increased sales of  the Company's products.  Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8,567 and $14,575, respectively. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $15,676 and $(6,479), respectively.  Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(844,505) compared to net loss of $(5,554,706) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in net loss is due to the decrease in operating expenses for the first three fiscal quarters of 2016 compared to the first three fiscal quarters of 2015 for the reasons discussed below.

Total operating expenses were $890,009 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5,413,153 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015.  The significant decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributable to non-cash transactions involving the issuance of capital stock in exchange for services and the extinguishment of debt that took place in the first three fiscal quarters of 2015.   Since similar transactions did not take place during the first three fiscal quarters of 2016, operating expenses were more typical of actual operating expenses.   Other general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional fees, payroll expenses, rent and transfer agent fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our operations used $168,755 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Investing activities used $10,987 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and financing activities provided cash of $245,285 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash required during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, came principally from cash proceeds from related parties in the amount of $251,300.

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  We incurred net loss of $884,092 and $5,554,706, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $54,970,304 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company may seek to raise money for working capital purposes through a public offering of its equity capital or through a private placement of convertible debt.  It will be important for the Company to be successful in its efforts to raise capital in this manner if it is going to be able to further its business plan in an aggressive manner.  Raising capital in this manner will cause dilution to current shareholders. As mentioned before, for the immediate needs of our current operations, we anticipate continuing to fund operations through management and shareholder loans. There can be no assurance that management and shareholders will continue to loan the Company funds.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
