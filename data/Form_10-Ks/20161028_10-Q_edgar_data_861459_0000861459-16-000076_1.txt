1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Granite Construction Incorporated ( we,   us,   our,   the Company  or  Granite ) and are unaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. Further, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly our financial position at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the results of our operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The   December 31, 2015   condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.   
  Our operations are typically affected more by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues and profitability. Therefore, the results of operations for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
  We prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as our annual consolidated financial statements, except for the addition of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In addition, during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810)  ,     ASU     No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , ASU No. 2015-05,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software     (Subtopic 350-40)   and     ASU No. 2015-15  , Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   none of which had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Reclassifications:   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current year presentation.  
   
           2. 
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides guidance for revenue recognition and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. This ASU s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which     deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):     Principal versus Agent Considerations     (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide a good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   which clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations, and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   which clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds a practical expedient for certain aspects of the guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU 2014-09. These ASUs will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these ASUs on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,   which, among other things, eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. This ASU will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (b) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The ASU will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2019. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,   which     clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This ASU will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2017. We do not expect any changes in the counterparty to our cash flow hedge and therefore do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employe  e   Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. We expect to early adopt this ASU commencing with our year ending December 31, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The amendments in this ASU clarify and provide specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current U.S. GAAP. This ASU will be effective commencing with our quarter ending March 31, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
   
           3. 
    Revisions in Estimates 
     Our profit recognition related to construction contracts is based on estimates of costs to complete each project. These estimates can vary significantly in the normal course of business as projects progress, circumstances develop and evolve, and uncertainties are resolved. When we experience significant changes in our estimates of costs to complete, we undergo a process that includes reviewing the nature of the changes to ensure that there are no material amounts that should have been recorded in a prior period rather than as revisions in estimates for the current period. In our review of these changes for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not identify any material amounts that should have been recorded in a prior period. We use the cumulative catch-up method applicable to construction contract accounting to account for revisions in estimates. Under this method, revisions in estimates are accounted for in their entirety in the period of change. There can be no assurance that we will not experience further changes in circumstances or otherwise be required to revise our cost estimates in the future.

Construction 
  The changes in project profitability from revisions in estimates, both increases and decreases that individually had an impact of $1.0 million or more on gross profit were net increases of   $0.7 million   and net decreases of   $3.1 million   for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The changes for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , were net increases of   $3.7 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively. The projects are summarized as follows: 
  Increases    

  The increases during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were due to lower costs and higher productivity than originally anticipated as well as settlements of outstanding issues with contract owners during the nine month period. The increases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were due to settlements of outstanding issues with contract owners and lower costs than anticipated as well as owner-directed scope changes and estimated cost recovery from claims, net of claim related costs during the nine months. 
  Decreases   

  The decreases during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were due to additional costs and lower productivity than originally anticipated. 
  Large Project Construction 
  The changes in project profitability from revisions in estimates, both increases and decreases that individually had an impact of $1.0 million or more on gross profit were net increases of   $0.4 million   and net decreases of   $6.0 million   for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The changes for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were net increases of   $5.0 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively. There were   no   amounts attributable to non-controlling interests for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the amounts attributable to non-controlling interests were   $3.5 million   of the net decreases for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and were   $1.4 million   and   $0.3 million   of the net increases for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The projects are summarized as follows: 
  Increases 

The increases during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were due to owner-directed scope changes, settlement of an outstanding back charge claim and higher productivity than originally anticipated as well as estimated recovery from back charge claims during the nine month period. The increases during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were due to settlements of outstanding issues with contract owners and owner-directed scope changes, as well as estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims during the nine month period, net of claim related costs.

Decreases 

The decreases during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were due to additional design, weather and owner-related costs, net of estimated recovery from back charge and customer affirmative claims as well as lower productivity and higher costs than originally anticipated. 
  The impact to gross profit from significant revisions in estimates related to estimated and actual claim and back charge recoveries as well as the associated estimated contract costs are included in the tables above. 
  Revisions in estimates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included increases in revenue of   $1.2 million   and   $21.4 million  , respectively, related to the estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims. Of these totals,   $0.2 million   and   $15.5 million  , were also affected by an increase in estimated contract costs that were in excess of the estimated recovery during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the remaining   $1.0 million   and   $5.9 million  , estimated contract costs in excess of estimated cost recovery were recorded in prior periods.   
  Revisions in estimates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included increases in revenue of   $35.0 million   and   $44.7 million  , respectively, related to the estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims. Of these totals,   $33.1 million   was also affected by an increase in estimated contract costs that were in excess of the estimated recovery during both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the remaining   $1.9 million   and   $11.6 million  , estimated contract costs in excess of estimated cost recovery were recorded in prior periods.   
  Revisions in estimates for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included increases in gross profit of   $3.3 million   and   $10.9 million  , respectively, related to the estimated recovery of back charge claims. Of these totals,   $1.2 million   and   $3.4 million   were also affected by an increase in estimated contract costs that were in excess of the estimated recovery during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the remaining   $2.1 million   and   $7.5 million  , estimated contract costs in excess of estimated cost recovery were recorded in prior periods. There was   no   estimated recovery of back charge claims during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
           4. 
    Marketable Securities 
     All marketable securities were classified as held-to-maturity as of the dates presented and the carrying amounts of held-to-maturity securities were as follows:

    Fair Value Measurement 
     We measure our cash equivalents and our interest rate and commodity swap derivative contracts at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. The carrying values of receivables, other current assets, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not record any fair value adjustments related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
  The following tables summarize our cash equivalents by significant investment categories (in thousands): 

A reconciliation of cash equivalents to consolidated cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 

Derivatives 
  We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the cash flow hedge that we entered into in January 2016 was   $1.3 million   and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on the effective portion were net gains of   $0.4 million   and net losses of   $1.0 million  , respectively, and were reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   there was no ineffective portion and the interest expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. We estimate   $0.5 million   to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into pre-tax earnings within the next twelve months. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the fair value of the interest rate swap that we entered into in March 2014 was   $1.1 million  ,   $0.6 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, and was included in other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses of   $0.6 million   and net gains of   $1.0 million  , respectively, and during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   we recorded net gains of   $1.2 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. These net gains and losses were included in other (income) expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Other Derivatives 
  Our diesel and natural gas commodity swaps were settled in October 2015. As of   September 30, 2015  , the fair value of these swaps was   $0.7 million   and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During each of the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded net losses of   $0.4 million   on these swaps which were included in other (income) expense, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Other Assets and Liabilities 
  The carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments that are not required to be recorded at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 

1   The fair values of the 2019 Notes and Credit Agreement (defined in Note 10) are based on borrowing rates available to us for long-term debt with similar terms, average maturities, and credit risk.  
   
           6. 
    Receivables, net 

Receivables include amounts billed and billable to clients for services provided as of the end of the applicable period and, except for escrow receivables, do not bear interest. Included in Other receivables at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   were items such as estimated recovery from back charge claims, notes receivable, fuel tax refunds, receivables from vendors and income tax refunds. No such receivables individually exceeded 10% of total net receivables at any of these dates. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated recovery from back charge claims included in Other receivables was   $9.3 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively, and there were   no   receivables related to back charges as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  To the extent costs are not contractually billable or have not been earned, such as claim recovery estimates, the associated revenue is included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings or billings   i  n excess of costs and estimated earnings, respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the aggregate claim recovery estimates, included in these balances, were approximately   $7.8 million  ,   $8.8 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively. Ultimate settlement with the customer is dependent on the claims resolution process and could extend beyond one year or the project operating cycle.

Certain construction contracts include retainage provisions and the associated retention receivables are considered financing receivables. The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to these provisions generally become due upon completion and acceptance of the project work or products by the owners. No retention receivable individually exceeded 10% of total net receivables at any of the presented dates. As of   September 30, 2016  , the majority of the retentions receivable are expected to be collected within one year. 
  We segregate our retention receivables into two categories: escrow and non-escrow. The balances in each category were as follows:  

The escrow receivables include amounts due to Granite that have been deposited into an escrow account and bear interest. Typically, escrow retention receivables are held until work on a project is complete and has been accepted by the owner who then releases those funds, along with accrued interest, to us. There is minimal risk of not collecting on these amounts. 
  As of all periods presented, there were no significant collectability issues related to non-escrow retention receivables. 
   
           7. 
    Construction Joint Ventures 
     We participate in various construction joint ventures, partnerships and limited liability companies of which we are a limited member ( joint ventures ). 
  We have determined that certain of these joint ventures are consolidated because they are variable interest entities ( VIEs ), and we are the primary beneficiary. We continually evaluate whether there are changes in the status of the VIEs or changes to the primary beneficiary designation of the VIE. Based on our assessments during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we determined no change to the primary beneficiary was required for existing construction joint ventures. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $5.4 billion   of construction revenue to be recognized on unconsolidated and line item construction joint venture contracts of which   $1.7 billion   represented our share and the remaining   $3.7 billion   represented the other members  share. We are not able to estimate amounts, if any, that may be required beyond the remaining cost of the work to be performed. These costs could be offset by billings to the customer or by proceeds from other members and/or other guarantors. 
  The volume and stage of completion of contracts from our consolidated and unconsolidated construction joint ventures may cause fluctuations in cash and cash equivalents and, for consolidated construction joint ventures, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, costs in excess of billings and estimated earnings and property and equipment between periods. 
  The assets and liabilities of each consolidated and unconsolidated construction joint venture relate solely to that joint venture. The decision to distribute joint venture assets must generally be made jointly by a majority of the members and, accordingly, these assets, including those associated with estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims and back charge claims, are generally not available for the working capital needs of Granite until distributed. 
  Consolidated Construction Joint Ventures ( CCJVs ) 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were engaged in   five   active CCJV projects with total contract values ranging from   $46.5 million   to   $291.2 million  . Our share of revenue remaining to be recognized on these CCJVs ranged from   $7.7 million   to   $181.1 million  . Our proportionate share of the equity in these joint ventures is between   50.0%   and   65.0%  . During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total revenue from CCJVs was   $24.8 million   and   $79.9 million  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , total revenue from CCJVs was   $14.0 million   and   $39.0 million  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, CCJVs provided   $7.8 million   and used   $16.8 million   of operating cash flows, respectively.

Unconsolidated Construction Joint Ventures 
  We account for our share of construction joint ventures that we are not required to consolidate on a pro rata basis in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and as a single line item on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , these unconsolidated construction joint ventures were engaged in   twelve   active projects with total contract values ranging from   $78.5 million   to   $3.6 billion  . Our proportionate share of the equity in these unconsolidated construction joint ventures ranges from   20.0%   to   50.0%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of the revenue remaining to be recognized on these unconsolidated construction joint ventures ranged from   $0.9 million   to   $527.6 million  .  
  The following tables present summary financial information related to unconsolidated construction joint ventures: 

1    Included in this balance as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 was   $62.5 million  ,   $39.7 million   and   $34.9 million  , respectively, related to Granite s share of estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims. In addition, this balance  included   $5.9 million   related to Granite s share of estimated recovery of back charge claims as of September 30, 2016. There were   no   estimated recovery of back charge claims as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015. 
   2   As of   September 30, 2016  , December 31, 2015 and   September 30, 2015   this balance included   $6.8 million  ,   $8.6 million   and   $13.1 million  , respectively, of deficit in construction joint ventures that is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

1   While Granite s interest in revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit were correctly stated, Total revenue and revenue for partners  interest and adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were misstated in our Quarterly Reports for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Total revenue and revenue for partner s interest and adjustments as reported was (in thousands):   $288,044   and   $141,785  , respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and was   $682,002   and   $552,986  , respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Total revenue and revenue for partner s interest and adjustments should have been (in thousands):   $494,167   and   $347,908  , respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and   $475,879   and   $346,863  , respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The misstatements did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements in any period. We assessed the materiality of the errors in accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin 99 and concluded that the errors were not material to either of these previously issued financial statements. Accordingly, we will revise our previously issued financial statements prospectively to correct these errors. 
   2   Partners  interest and adjustments represents amounts to reconcile total revenue and total cost of revenue as reported by our partners to Granite s interest adjusted to reflect our accounting policies and estimates. 
   3   While Granite s interest in revenue, cost of revenue and gross profit were correctly stated, total and partners  interest for revenue and cost of revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 were misstated in our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and have been revised. Total revenue, partner s interest in revenue, total cost of revenue and partners  interest in cost of revenue reported were (in thousands):   $530,215  ,   $382,465  ,   $424,492   and   $287,784  , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and   $1,439,766  ,   $1,018,565  ,   $1,270,793   and   $879,653  , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The misstatements did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. We assessed the materiality of the errors in accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin 99 and concluded that the errors were not material to the previously issued financial statements. 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , unconsolidated construction joint venture net income was   $38.7 million   and   $68.0 million  , respectively, of which our share was   $10.3 million   and   $15.9 million  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , unconsolidated construction joint venture net income was   $19.5 million   and   $86.9 million  , respectively, of which our share was   $11.1 million   and   $29.7 million  , respectively. These joint venture net income amounts exclude our corporate overhead required to manage the joint ventures and include taxes only to the extent the applicable states or cities have joint venture level taxes. 
  Line Item Joint Ventures 
  We participate in various  line item  joint venture agreements under which each member is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work. The revenue for each line item joint venture member s discrete items of work is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture member bears the profitability risk associated with its own work. There is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture. Each member accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self-performed contract. We include only our portion of these contracts in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   four   active line item joint venture construction projects with total contract values ranging from   $42.2 million   to   $87.8 million   of which our portion ranged from   $28.3 million   to   $64.9 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of revenue remaining to be recognized on these line item joint ventures ranged from   $0.2 million   to   $23.6 million  . During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our portion of revenue from line item joint ventures was   $9.5 million   and   $23.5 million  , respectively.  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our portion of revenue from line item joint ventures was   $2.2 million   and   $18.0 million  , respectively.

    Debt Covenants and Events of Default 
     Our debt and credit agreements require us to comply with various affirmative, restrictive and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of our debt or credit agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of our agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or credit agreements. Default under our debt and credit agreements could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under the agreements; (ii) termination of the agreements; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under the agreements be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements; and/or (v) foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $296.3 million   credit facility, of which   $200.0 million   was a revolving credit facility and   $96.3 million   was a term loan that matures on October 28, 2020 (the  Maturity Date ) and has a sublimit for letters of credit of   $100.0 million   (the  Credit Agreement ). As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $5.0 million   of the   $96.3 million   term loan was included in current maturities of long-term debt and the remaining   $91.3 million   was included in long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , senior notes payable in the amount of   $160.0 million   were due to a group of institutional holders in four remaining equal annual installments from 2016 through 2019 and bear interest at   6.11%   per annum ( 2019 Notes ). Of the   $40.0 million   due for the 2016 installment of the 2019 Notes,   $30.0 million   is included in long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, as we have the ability and intent to pay this installment using borrowings under the Credit Agreement or by obtaining other sources of financing. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   $10.0 million   of the outstanding 2019 Notes was included in current maturities of long-term debt and the remaining   $150.0 million   was included in long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our note purchase agreement governing our 2019 Notes and Credit Agreement. We are not aware of any non-compliance by any of our unconsolidated real estate entities with the covenants contained in their debt agreements.

In the ordinary course of business, we or our joint ventures and affiliates are involved in various legal proceedings alleging, among other things, public liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with the performance of services and/or materials provided, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with certainty. We are also subject to government inquiries and reporting requirements seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with certainty. 
  Some of the matters in which we or our joint ventures and affiliates are involved may involve compensatory, punitive, or other claims or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not probable to be incurred or cannot currently be reasonably estimated. In addition, in some circumstances our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended, debarred or incur other administrative penalties or sanctions, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. While any of our pending legal proceedings may be subject to early resolution as a result of our ongoing efforts to settle, whether or when any legal proceeding will be resolved through settlement is neither predictable nor guaranteed. 
  Accordingly, it is possible that future developments in such proceedings and inquiries could require us to (i) adjust existing accruals, or (ii) record new accruals that we did not originally believe to be probable or that could not be reasonably estimated. Such changes could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows in any particular reporting period. In addition to matters that are considered probable for which the loss can be reasonably estimated, we also disclose certain matters where the loss is considered reasonably possible and is reasonably estimable.  
  Liabilities relating to legal proceedings and government inquiries, to the extent that we have concluded such liabilities are probable and the amounts of such liabilities are reasonably estimable, are recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate liabilities recorded as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   related to these matters were approximately   $0.7 million  ,   $5.2 million   and   $9.2 million  , respectively, and were primarily included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The aggregate range of possible loss related to (i) matters considered reasonably possible, and (ii) reasonably possible amounts in excess of accrued losses recorded for probable loss contingencies, was immaterial as of   September 30, 2016  .

     Forward-Looking Disclosure 
  From time to time, Granite makes certain comments and disclosures in reports and statements, including in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or statements made by its officers or directors, that are not based on historical facts, including statements regarding future events, occurrences, circumstances, activities, performance, outcomes and results, that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are identified by words such as  future,   outlook,   assumes,   believes,   expects,   estimates,   anticipates,   intends,   plans,   appears,   may,   will,   should,   could,   would,   continue,  and the negatives thereof or other comparable terminology or by the context in which they are made. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of Granite. These forward-looking statements are estimates reflecting the best judgment of senior management and reflect our current expectations regarding future events, occurrences, circumstances, activities, performance, outcomes and results. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based on beliefs, assumptions or estimates that may prove to be incorrect. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those more specifically described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under  Item 1A. Risk Factors.      Due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our forward-looking statements, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. The reader is also cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason  . 

Overview 
  We are one of the largest diversified heavy civil contractors and construction materials producers in the United States, engaged in the construction and improvement of streets, roads, highways, mass transit facilities, airport infrastructure, bridges, trenchless and underground utilities, power-related facilities, water-related facilities, utilities, tunnels, dams and other infrastructure-related projects. We have three reportable business segments: Construction, Large Project Construction and Construction Materials (see Note 14 of  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ). 
  In addition to business segments, we review our business by operating groups and by public and private market sectors. Our operating groups are defined as follows: (i) California; (ii) Northwest, which primarily includes offices in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Washington; (iii) Heavy Civil, which primarily includes offices in California, Florida, New York and Texas; and (iv) Kenny, which primarily includes an office in Illinois.  
  With the exception of contract change orders and affirmative claims, which are typically sole-source, our construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding in response to solicitations by both public agencies and private parties and on a negotiated basis as a result of solicitations from private parties. Our bidding activity is affected by such factors as the nature and volume of advertising and other solicitations, contract backlog, available personnel, current utilization of equipment and other resources, our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations. Bidding activity, contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period. 
  The four primary economic drivers of our business are (i) the overall health of the economy; (ii) federal, state and local public funding levels; (iii) population growth resulting in public and private development; and (iv) the need to replace or repair aging infrastructure. Changes in these drivers can either reduce our revenues and/or gross profit margins or provide opportunities for revenue growth and gross profit margin improvement.

Current Economic Environment and Outlook 
  Both public and private markets remain highly competitive. Private market activity, across geographies and end markets, continues to drive growth opportunities. Current record backlog of   $3.8 billion   reflects positive steady trends, against a backdrop of modest economic growth. We continue to anticipate positive demand impact from improved public-spending trends in 2017 and beyond, which we expect will result primarily in growth opportunities for our Construction and Construction Materials segments. 
  To date, we believe the five-year Fixing America s Surface Transportation ( FAST ) Act has been a stabilizing force for state departments of transportation. It has improved their visibility and their planning, but it is not yet a growth catalyst. Public transportation investment continues to lag demand, with bidding activity steady and stable. In California, a unified industry continues to work with elected officials to garner support for incremental investment. We believe that significant, long-term transportation funding solutions in California are achievable either after Election Day or early in 2017. 
  The market for our Large Project Construction segment remains robust. As we prioritize the tens of billions of dollars  worth of future North American projects, we expect to build and maintain a broad roster from $10 billion to $20 billion of bidding opportunities over a rolling, two-year period for the foreseeable future. We are focused on appropriately managing risk in all of our bidding opportunities, allowing us to focus on projects with appropriate returns relative to risks.  
   
  Results of Operations 
  Our operations are typically affected more by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues and profitability. Therefore, the results of operations of a given quarter are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
  The following table presents a financial summary for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

Revenue 
  Total Revenue by Segment

Table of Contents  

Construction Revenue 

1   For the periods presented, this Construction revenue was earned only from the public sector. 
  Construction revenue for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $37.6 million  , or   8.8%  , and   $84.3 million  , or   9.2%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to an increase in awards in the private sector of the California operating group and an increase in beginning contract backlog in the Northwest operating group and in the Kenny operating group public sector. These increases were partially offset by jobs nearing completion without the replacement of new work in the Kenny operating group private sector and, during the nine months, decreased bid activity in the California operating group public sector and the Northwest operating group private sector. 
  Large Project Construction Revenue 

1   For the periods presented, this Large Project Construction revenue was earned only from the public sector. 
  Large Project Construction revenue for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $32.3 million  , or   14.9%  , and   $51.8 million  , or   8.8%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to progress on new projects in the Heavy Civil operating group, California group and, during the nine months, in the Kenny operating group public sector. The increases were partially offset by decreases in the Northwest operating group and Kenny operating group private sector from the completion of projects in late 2015 while new awards were in their early stages. 
  Construction Materials Revenue 

Construction Materials revenue for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   $17.3 million  , or   16.2%  , and   $29.1 million  , or   12.7%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   due to a decline in external volume in the California operating group partially offset by an increase in the Northwest operating group from increased sales volume at higher sales prices. However, internal sales volumes increased during the periods as a result of an increase in the use of materials by our Construction segment projects.

Contract Backlog 
  Our contract backlog consists of the unearned revenue on awarded contracts, including 100% of our consolidated joint venture contracts and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. We generally include a project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Certain federal and municipal government contracts where funding is appropriated on a periodic basis are included in contract backlog at the time of the award when it is probable the contract value will be funded and executed. Existing contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog to the extent their issuance is probable or options are exercised. Substantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer; however, we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past. 
  Total Contract Backlog by Segment 

Construction Contract Backlog 

Construction contract backlog of   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   was   $42.8 million  , or   3.7%  , lower than at   June 30, 2016   due to completion of existing projects in the public sector of California, Northwest and Kenny operating groups. Decreases were partially offset by new awards in the Heavy Civil operating group and in the private sector of the California and Kenny operating groups. Significant new awards during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , included a $28.7 million federal airfield repair and repave project in Kentucky, a $22.7 million bridge reconstruction project in Illinois and a $39.3 million new rail station sub-contract in Washington.

Large Project Construction Contract Backlog 

1   For the periods presented, this Large Project Construction contract backlog was related to contracts with public agencies.  
   2   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  ,   $0.9 million  ,   $3.5 million   and   $20.1 million  , respectively, of the Kenny public sector contract backlog was translated from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars at the spot rate in effect at the reporting date. 
  Large Project Construction contract backlog of   $2.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   was   $56.4 million  , or   2.2%  , higher than at   June 30, 2016  , due to new awards in the Heavy Civil operating group partially offset by progress on existing projects in all other operating groups. New awards during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included our $291.6 million share of a rail project in Hawaii. 
  Non-controlling partners  share of Large Project Construction contract backlog as of   September 30, 2016  ,   June 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015   was   $155.0 million  ,   $158.6 million   and   $80.1 million  , respectively. 
   
  Gross Profit 
  Although uncommon, revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized if there is not sufficient information to determine the estimated profit on the project with a reasonable level of certainty. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there was sufficient information to determine the estimated profit on all of our projects with a reasonable level of certainty. Gross profit can vary significantly in periods where previously deferred profit is recognized on one or more projects or, conversely, if we have outstanding claims that are not probable or estimable.  
  The following table presents gross profit by business segment for the respective periods: 

Construction gross profit for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $11.1 million  , or   18.3%  , and   $27.6 million  , or   23.0%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Construction gross profit as a percentage of segment revenue for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   15.4%   from   14.2%   and to   14.7%   from   13.0%  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were primarily due to increased revenue volume and margin improvement from increased private sector projects and increased margin on contract backlog at the beginning of each 2016 period compared to 2015. The increases during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were partially offset by decreases from estimated probable cost recoveries on claims and net changes from revisions in estimates (see Note 3 of  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ).

Large Project Construction gross profit for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   $1.9 million  , or   8.6%  , and decreased by   $3.0 million  , or   5.6%  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in   2015  . Large Project Construction gross profit as a percentage of segment revenue for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   9.4%   from   10.0%   and to   7.9%   from   9.1%  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015. The decreases were primarily due to net changes from revisions in estimates (see Note 3 of  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ). Progress on projects that began in late 2015 and early 2016 partially offset the net decreases from revisions in estimates. 
  Construction Materials gross profit for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   $1.3 million  , or   9.6%  , and   $3.7 million  , or   14.3%  , respectively, when compared to same periods in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a decline in external sales volumes partially offset by a decrease in costs. 
   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  The following table presents the components of selling, general and administrative expenses for the respective periods: 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $8.9 million  , or   19.7%  , and   $15.2 million  , or   10.6%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .  
  Selling Expenses 
  Selling expenses include the costs for estimating and bidding, business development and materials facility permits. Selling expenses can vary depending on the volume of projects in process and the number of employees assigned to estimating and bidding activities. As projects are completed or the volume of work slows down, we temporarily redeploy project employees to bid on new projects, moving their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to selling expenses. Selling expenses during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $2.0 million  , or   16.6%  , and   $3.0 million  , or   7.7%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to increases in salaries and related expenses from increased bidding activity.  
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate functions. These costs include variable cash and restricted stock performance-based incentives for select management personnel on which our compensation strategy heavily relies. The cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed as earned over the vesting period of the restricted stock award (generally three years; however, immediate vesting may apply to certain awards pursuant to the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan). Other general and administrative expenses include travel and entertainment, outside services, information technology, depreciation, occupancy, training, office supplies, changes in the fair market value of our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation plan liability and other miscellaneous expenses, none of which individually exceeded 10% of total general and administrative expenses. Total general and administrative expenses for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $6.9 million  , or   20.9%   and   $12.2 million  , or   11.7%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses from increased incentive compensation and related costs associated with higher net income. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2016 also included an increase in other general and administrative expenses from a change in the fair market value of our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation plan liability, which is offset in other (income) expense. In addition, the increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to an increase in restricted stock unit amortization from awards issued in the first quarter of 2016, a portion of which immediately vested.

Other (Income) Expense 
  The following table presents the components of other (income) expense for the respective periods: 

Interest expense   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $0.5 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to a reduction of the principal balance of our   2019 Notes (as defined in the Senior Notes Payable section below)   from payments made in late 2015. Equity in income of affiliates   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $1.3 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to   income associated with an unconsolidated real estate affiliate and with the non-real estate entity.   Other (income) expense, net   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $0.8 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to   changes in the fair market values of our interest rate swap and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation plan assets as well as a gain associated with a consolidated real estate entity for the nine month period. 
  Income Taxes 
  The following table presents the provision for income taxes for the respective periods: 

We calculate our income tax provision at the end of each interim period by estimating our annual effective tax rate and applying that rate to our year-to-date ordinary earnings.  The effect of changes in enacted tax laws, tax rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. 
  Our effective tax rate for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to 30.5% from 35.5% and to 30.8% from 35.4%,   respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015  . These changes were primarily due to an increase in non-controlling interests and an increase in   the domestic production activities deduction fo  r the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  Amount Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
  The following table presents the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for the respective periods:   

  The amount attributable to non-controlling interests represents the non-controlling owners  share of the income or loss of our consolidated construction joint ventures and real estate entities. The change for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due   to the estimated recovery of back charge claims in 2016 and income from a consolidated construction joint venture awarded in the third quarter of 2015. 
   
  Certain Legal Proceedings 
  As discussed in Note 13 of  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  under certain circumstances the resolution of certain legal proceedings to which we are subject could have direct or indirect consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and/or liquidity. 
  
    27 

Table of Contents  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The timing differences between our cash inflows and outflows require us to maintain adequate levels of working capital. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, available borrowing capacity and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs, capital expenditures, financial commitments, cash dividend payments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for the next twelve months. We maintain a collateralized credit facility of   $296.3 million  , of which   $189.8 million   was available at   September 30, 2016  , to provide capital needs to fund growth opportunities, either internal or generated through acquisitions (see Credit Agreement discussion below) or to pay installments on our 2019 Notes (see Senior Notes Payable discussion below). We do not anticipate that this credit facility will be required to fund future working capital needs associated with our existing operations. If we experience a prolonged change in our business operating results or make a significant acquisition, we may need to acquire additional sources of financing, which, if available, may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants, or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements. There can be no assurance that sufficient capital will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us.  
  We typically invoice our customers on a monthly basis. Our contracts frequently call for retention that is a specified percentage withheld from each payment until the contract is completed and the work accepted by the customer. Our revenue, gross profit and the resulting cash flows can differ significantly from period to period due to a variety of factors, including our projects  progressions toward completion, outstanding contract change orders and claims and the payment terms of our contracts.  
  The following table presents our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including amounts from our consolidated joint ventures (     CCJVs     ), as of the respective dates: 

1   The volume and stage of completion of contracts from our CCJVs may cause fluctuations in joint venture cash and cash equivalents between periods. These funds generally are not available for the working capital or other liquidity needs of Granite until distributed. 
   2   See Note 4 of  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  for the composition of our marketable securities. 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations. We may also from time to time access our Credit Agreement (defined below), issue and sell equity, debt or hybrid securities or engage in other capital markets transactions. 
  Our cash and cash equivalents consisted of deposits and money market funds held with established national financial institutions. Marketable securities consist of U.S. Government and agency obligations and commercial paper.  
  Granite s portion of consolidated joint venture cash and cash equivalents was   $29.2 million  ,   $28.9 million   and   $26.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Granite s portion of unconsolidated joint venture cash and cash equivalents was   $150.9 million  ,   $127.8 million   and   $140.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The assets of each consolidated and unconsolidated construction joint venture relate solely to that joint venture. The decision to distribute joint venture assets must generally be made jointly by a majority of the members and, accordingly, these assets, including those associated with estimated cost recovery of customer affirmative claims and back charge claims, are generally not available for the working capital needs of Granite until distributed.  
  Our principal uses of liquidity are paying the costs and expenses associated with our operations, servicing outstanding indebtedness, making capital expenditures and paying dividends on our capital stock. We may also from time to time prepay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness and acquire assets or businesses that are complementary to our operations.

Cash Flows 

As a large construction and heavy civil contractor and construction materials producer, our operating cash flows are subject to seasonal cycles, as well as the cycles associated with winning, performing and closing projects. Additionally, operating cash flows are impacted by the timing related to funding construction joint ventures and the resolution of uncertainties inherent in the complex nature of the work that we perform, including claims settlements. 
  Cash used in operating activities of   $20.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represents a   $12.2 million   increase from the cash used in operating activities during the same period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to a   $28.4 million   increase in cash used in working capital primarily due to increases from CCJVs and in inventory from increased demand. The increase from working capital was offset by an   $8.1 million   increase in net income after adjusting for non-cash items and an   $8.1 million   decrease in net contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  Cash used in investing activities of   $60.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represents a   $55.4 million   increase in the cash used in investing activities during the same period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to an increase in purchases, net of sales proceeds, of property and equipment (see Capital Expenditures discussion below) and in purchases, net of maturities, of marketable securities.   
  Cash used in financing activities of   $21.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represents a   $0.9 million   increase in the cash used in financing activities during the same period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to a   $1.6 million   increase in repurchases of common stock related to shares surrendered to pay taxes for vested restricted stock and   $3.4 million   increase in long-term debt principal payments partially offset by a   $3.3 million   increase in net contributions from non-controlling partners related to consolidated joint ventures.  
  Capital Expenditures 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had capital expenditures of   $67.9 million   compared to   $26.1 million   during the same period in   2015  . Major capital expenditures are typically for aggregate and asphalt production facilities, aggregate reserves, construction equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements and investments in our information technology systems. The timing and amount of such expenditures can vary based on the progress of planned capital projects, the type and size of construction projects, changes in business outlook and other factors. We currently anticipate 2016 capital expenditures to be between $80.0 million and $90.0 million, including approximately $30.0 million of job specific equipment for our Large Project Construction segment, of which approximately $7.0 million is our CCJVs partners  share.   
  Derivatives 
  We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value using Level 2 inputs.  
  In January 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap designed to convert the interest rate on our term loan from a variable to fixed rate (See Credit Agreement section below). 
  In March 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap designed to convert the interest rate on our 2019 Notes (as defined below) from a fixed to variable rate (See Senior Notes Payable section below). 
  Our diesel and natural gas commodity swaps were settled in October 2015. As of   September 30, 2015  , the fair value of these swaps was   $0.7 million   and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded net losses of   $0.4 million   on these swaps which were included in other (income) expense, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Credit Agreement 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $296.3 million   credit facility, of which   $200.0 million   was a revolving credit facility and   $96.3 million   was a term loan that matures on October 28, 2020 (the  Maturity Date ) and has a sublimit for letters of credit of   $100.0 million   (the  Credit Agreement ).  
  Of the original   $100.0 million   term loan, we paid   1.25%   of the principal balance during each of the three months ended March 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016. Of the remaining   $96.3 million  , 1.25% of the original principal balance is due in eight quarterly installments, 2.50% of the original principal balance is due in nine quarterly installments beginning in December 2018 and the remaining balance is due on the Maturity Date. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $91.3 million   of the   $96.3 million   term loan was included in long-term debt and the remaining   $5.0 million   was included in current maturities of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total stated amount of all issued and outstanding letters of credit under credit facility was   $10.2 million  . The total unused availability under the Credit Agreement was   $189.8 million  . The letters of credit will expire between October 2016 and March 2017.  
  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate (at our option), plus an applicable margin based on certain financial ratios calculated quarterly. LIBOR varies based on the applicable loan term, market conditions and other external factors. The applicable margin was   1.75%   for loans bearing interest based on LIBOR and   0.75%   for loans bearing interest at the base rate at   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, the effective interest rate using three-month LIBOR and base rate was between   2.60%   and   4.25%  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016   and we elected to use LIBOR.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the cash flow hedge that we entered into in January 2016, was   $1.3 million   and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on the effective portion were   $0.4 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, and were reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   there was no ineffective portion and the interest expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively.  
  The Credit Agreement provides for the release of the liens securing the obligations, at our option and expense, so long as certain conditions as defined by the terms in the Credit Agreement are satisfied ( Collateral Release Period ).  However, if subsequent to exercising the option, our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is less than 1.25 or our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.50, then we would be required to promptly re-pledge substantially all of the assets of the Company and our subsidiaries that are guarantors or borrowers under the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the conditions for the exercise of our right under the Credit Agreement to have liens released were not satisfied. 
  Senior Notes Payable 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , senior notes payable in the amount of   $160.0 million   were due to a group of institutional holders in four remaining equal annual installments from 2016 through 2019 and bear interest at   6.11%   per annum ( 2019 Notes ). Of the   $40.0 million   due for the 2016 installment of the 2019 Notes,   $30.0 million   is included in long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, as we have the ability and intent to pay this installment using borrowings under the Credit Agreement or by obtaining other sources of financing. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, $10.0 million of the outstanding 2019 Notes was included in current maturities of long-term debt and the remaining $150.0 million was included in long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the fair value of the interest rate swap that we entered into in March 2014, was   $1.1 million  ,   $0.6 million   and   $2.1 million   and was included in other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses of   $0.6 million   and net gains of   $1.0 million  , respectively, and during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   we recorded net gains of   $1.2 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. These net gains and losses were included in other (income) expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Surety Bonds and Real Estate Mortgages 
  We are generally required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $3.5 billion   of our contract backlog was bonded. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are generally released from the bonds after the owner accepts the work performed under contract. The ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties. 
  Our unconsolidated real estate held for development and sale is subject to mortgage indebtedness. This indebtedness is non-recourse to Granite but is recourse to the real estate entity. The terms of this indebtedness are typically renegotiated to reflect the evolving nature of the real estate project as it progresses through acquisition, entitlement and development. Modification of these terms may include changes in loan-to-value ratios requiring the real estate entity to repay portions of the debt. 
  Covenants and Events of Default 
  Our debt and credit agreements require us to comply with various affirmative, restrictive and financial covenants, including the financial covenants described below. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of our debt or credit agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of our agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or credit agreements. Default under our debt and credit agreements could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under the agreements; (ii) termination of the agreements; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under the agreements be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements and/or (v) foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements. 
  The most significant financial covenants under the terms of our Credit Agreement and 2019 NPA require the maintenance of a minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and pursuant to the definitions in the agreements, our Consolidated Tangible Net Worth was   $864.7 million  , which exceeded the minimum of   $691.3 million   and our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was   1.65  , which did not exceed the maximum of   3.00  . Our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was   11.74  , which exceeded the minimum of   4.00  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and related to the 2019 Notes. We are not aware of any non-compliance by any of our unconsolidated real estate entities with the covenants contained in their debt agreements.  
  Share Purchase Program 
  On April 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock at management s discretion, which replaced the former authorization including the amount available. We did not purchase shares under the share purchase program in any of the periods presented. The specific timing and amount of any future purchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors.

           b)

    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
  We operate surface mines in the western United States to produce construction aggregates. The operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ). MSHA conducted 10 and 9 inspections at 10 and 9 of our mines during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. There were no reportable citations or orders following 10 and 9 of those inspections during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  The chart below contains information regarding certain mining safety and health citations or orders that MSHA issued during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 associated with our mining operations.    

  With respect to the information in the above table, it should be noted that: (i) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of the mine, (ii) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and in that process may be reduced in severity and amount or dismissed. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , with respect to our mines: 
             
    MSHA did not issue any orders requiring persons to be withdrawn from the areas affected by the alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(b) of the Mine Act. 
                
    MSHA did not issue any citations or orders for unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under section 104(d) of the Mine Act. 
                
    MSHA did not identify any flagrant violations under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
                
    MSHA did not issue any imminent danger orders requiring immediate withdrawal from the affected areas under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act. 
                
    We did not experience any mining-related fatalities. 
                
    We did not receive written notice of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards from MSHA under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act or of the potential to have a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards from MSHA.  
                
    There were no legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and there were no such legal actions instituted or resolved. 
                
    Proposed assessments from the MSHA during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were less than three thousand dollars, respectively.
