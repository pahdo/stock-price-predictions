     Table of Contents          COSMOS HOLDINGS, INC.    Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016       NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The terms "COSM," "we," "the Company," and "us" as used in this report refer to Cosmos Holdings Inc. The accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management of COSM, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the two years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements filed in our Form 10-K and is included for comparison purposes in the accompanying balance sheet. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.       NOTE 2 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS      Cosmos Holdings, Inc. ("Cosmos", "the Company", the "Registrant", "we", or "us") was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. on July 21, 2009 for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets.     On September 27, 2013 (the "Closing"), the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction by which it acquired a private company, Amplerissimo Ltd ( Amplerissimo ). Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") between the Registrant and Amplerissimo, a company incorporated in Cyprus, the Registrant acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock.      On August 1, 2014, we, through our Cypriot subsidiary Amplerissimo, formed SkyPharm S.A. a Greek corporation ("SkyPharm") whose principal activities and operations are the development, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical, over the counter, and cosmetic products.      The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both of the branded pharmaceutical market and generic pharmaceutical products market. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products. To compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic categories, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.     We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of pharmaceutical products and companies in areas that will serve patients that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter ( OTC ) product lines by acquiring or licensing rights and regularly evaluate selective acquisition opportunities.                 6       
     Table of Contents           Going Concern      The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a total net loss of $277,797 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and has an accumulated deficit of $679,014 and a working capital deficit of $1,736,375 as of September 30, 2016, the Company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease development of operations.      In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product, by sale of common shares and debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies       Basis of Financial Statement Presentation      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with principles generally accepted in the United States of America.      Principles of Consolidation      Our consolidated accounts include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Amplerissimo Ltd and SkyPharm S.A. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.     The Company maintains bank accounts in the United States denominated in U.S. Dollars and in the Republic of Cyprus, in Greece and in Bulgaria all of them denominated in Euros.       Accounts Receivable       Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information.                  7       
     Table of Contents           Inventory       Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted average method. Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials, i.e. packaged pharmaceutical products and the wrappers and containers they are sold in. A periodic inventory system is maintained by 100% count. Inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment.      We write-down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions, which may differ from actual results.       Fixed Assets      Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives (except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life) of the assets as follows:                  Estimated Useful Life                   Furniture and fixtures      5-7 years                  Office and computer equipment      3-5 years           Depreciation expense was $6,956 and $6,996 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.      Fair Value Measurement      The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.     ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:     Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.     Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.      The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016.     Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of September 30, 2016, and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.     In addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option, or ASC 825-10-25, was effective for January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Revenue Recognition      We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.      Stock-based Compensation      The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with ASC section 718, "Stock Compensation" and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB 107) issued by the SEC in March 2005 regarding its interpretation of ASC 718. ASC 718 requires the fair value of all stock-based employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period. The Company values any employee or non-employee stock based compensation at fair value using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.     The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50 "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees".      Foreign Currency Translations and Transactions      Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated.     Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net earnings.      Income Taxes      The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.      The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus and Greece. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and 29% in Greece and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.      We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2016 the Company has maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.      We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax.                 9       
     Table of Contents           Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Common Share      Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. The per share amounts include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income. Basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the same due to the anti-dilutive nature of potential common stock equivalents.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of the revenue standard issued in 2014, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In response to stakeholders' requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements, the FASB proposed deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral. Respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is critical to its success.     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability. This ASU is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.     Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.       NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES      At September 30, 2016, the Company's effective tax rate differs from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2015, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the US federal statutory tax rate primarily due to earnings taxed at the lower income tax rate in Cyprus.      We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2016 the Company has a maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax.      As of September 30, 2016 the Company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax. The Company has recorded $65,368 of interest and penalties as interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in accordance with this policy.

Overview      Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.     The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and in order to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.     We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and we target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, with an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as research   development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling the Company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities.             During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company leased and equipped additional office space for our subsidiary SkyPharm in Thessaloniki, Greece in order to facilitate its growing business activity. The warehouse was already equipped with the proper shelves, working tables, medicine, cold fridge and barcode machines in compliance with all regulations. The offices in Thessaloniki have been also equipped with the proper equipment and specifically with the office tables, chairs and the terminals for each one working station. The hardware systems and software programs that are needed for the efficient trading of pharmaceuticals are already installed. As of July 22, 2015 the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to SkyPharm. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use. The Company has already incorporated the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices.      On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc.Pharma SA to purchase Doc.Pharma SA for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc.Pharma SA is controlled by Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO. The Memorandum of Understanding is subject to the Company's completion of due diligence and expires on December 31, 2016. We currently have no binding agreements, commitments, contracts or new cooperative agreements for the acquisition of other existing companies, except with respect to the Memoranda of Understanding described in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.     The Company, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, has recorded total revenues of $3,506,804 and has incurred expenses of approximately $3,192,472 in connection with these proposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will ever raise the required capital necessary to effectuate our business plan; and even if we do, there is no assurance that we will ever commence or successfully develop this line of business.       Results of Operations       Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $94,613 on revenue of $1,414,503, versus a net loss of $100,390 with no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Revenue      The Company had revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,414,503, versus no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to our subsidiary SkyPharm commencing its operations and sales at the end of 2015, and continued even more aggressively during the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Operating Expenses      Total operating expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $175,919, versus $75,152 during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The approximate 134% increase in operating expenses in the three month period in 2016, against the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily due to the increased costs of business operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm including, but not limited to, the related payroll expenses, costs of professional fees, consulting expenses and other associated expenses in connection with being a public company.       Unrealized Foreign Currency losses       Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency loss of $16,622 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $111,235 versus the unrealized foreign currency gain of $55,764 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $44,626 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.              Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $277,024 on revenue of $3,506,804, versus a net loss of $341,663 with no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Revenue      The Company had revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $3,506,804, versus no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Company's nine month period ended September 30, 2016, revenues increased by 100% as compared to no revenues in the period ended September 30, 2015. This variation was due to the fact that our subsidiary SkyPharm commenced its operations and sales at the end of 2015, and continued even more aggressively during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Operating Expenses      Total operating expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were $473,249 versus $269,237 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The approximate 76% increase in operating expenses in the nine month period in 2016, against the corresponding period in 2015, is primarily due to the increase of business operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm, including, but not limited to, the related payroll expenses, costs of professional fees, consulting expenses and other associated expenses in connection with being a public company.       Unrealized Foreign Currency losses       Additionally, we had an unrealized foreign currency loss of $38,185 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $315,982 versus the unrealized foreign currency losses of $394,148 such that our net comprehensive loss for the period was $735,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      At September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,736,375 and approximately $1,358,236 as of December 31, 2015. This increase in the working capital deficit is attributed to the increase of notes payable due to the growing needs to fund the operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm.     At the end the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $619,773 versus $198,049 as of December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $1,235,021 versus $329,598 net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increased use of cash is mainly attributed to the growing needs to fund the operations of our subsidiary SkyPharm.      During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there was $152,355 net cash used in investing activities versus $34,397 used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to the increase in loan receivables by our subsidiary SkyPharm.     During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there was $1,770,723 of net cash provided by financing activities versus $117,000 provided by financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in financing activities of our subsidiary SkyPharm.            We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of September 30, 2016, cash generated from the operations of the Company and its operating subsidiary and from debt or equity financing, or from a loan from management, to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets. Further, as a consequence we would fail to satisfy our reporting obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.      Revenue Recognition      We consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, goods or services have been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item, the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer, and we have sufficient evidence of collectability, such a payment history with the customer. Revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.      Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months      Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is as follows:     For our Subsidiary "SkyPharm S.A" we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across the new European Market and entering into countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Holland.      We are committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. Moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products. Thus, we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products. The Company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals, in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also.     Our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of our subsidiary, SkyPharm and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on branded pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and generic pharmaceuticals, with plans to expand into cosmetic-beauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position.     We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses.     The Company, in the following twelve months, intends to launch its operations within the markets of Generic pharmaceutical products, in Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food   Health Supplements. The specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of these products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance.     Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company's business.            In addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets. We currently have focused our efforts to our customers throughout Europe. We plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the European Union market. Some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are: promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas, creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions, and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $45,000 evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding to. This cost is made of up primarily legal fees, consulting fees, accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses.      We have to continue market our products directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare professionals. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other pharmaceutical companies, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. We believe this corporate strategy will allow us to maximize both the growth rate and profitability of the Company and at the same time to enhance shareholder value.     As to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector, SEC filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations, including any acquired business. So we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a company if we were to acquire them. We anticipate that we will spend approximately $50,000 to locate, conduct due diligence, and evaluate target companies for possible acquisitions. As noted above, as of the date of this Report, we do not have any binding agreements, commitments, or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates, except for the MOU s as described in the footnotes to the financials and in the  Subsequent Event  in Part II below.     On May 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Doc.Pharma SA to purchase Doc.Pharma SA for a combination of cash and stock to be agreed upon. Doc.Pharma SA is controlled by Grigorios Siokas, the Company's CEO. The Memorandum of Understanding is subject to the Company's completion of due diligence and expires on December 31, 2016.     In connection with Amplerissimo, we plan on continuing to offer the same products and services through Amplerissimo which include: data mining, statistical data analysis, research and analysis, negotiating services, credit risk analysis, credit management, conducting case studies, introduction services, e-commerce consulting, marketing management consulting, expansion strategies consulting, information systems consulting, and business management software consulting.      We will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. In addition, we remain committed to strategic R D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways.       Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      As of September 30, 2016 there were no off balance sheet arrangements.      Critical Accounting Policies      In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most "critical accounting polices" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.             Foreign Currency.  The Company requires translation of the Amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse take-over on September 27, 2013. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings.      Income Taxes.  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.     The Company is liable for income taxes in the Republic of Cyprus. The corporate income tax rate in Cyprus is 12.5% and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013 (prior to 2013, losses were carried forward indefinitely). Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership.     We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets.      We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management's judgment, the position is not more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position's technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions.      We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense, respectively.      Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 "Accounting for Income Taxes" as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.     The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Holdings, Inc. which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States, but recognize the income tax liabilities in the Republic of Cyprus.               Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       Not applicable. A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.      Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting       During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
