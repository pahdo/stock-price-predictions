NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  General Information 
  These statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015  . Management believes that the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, including normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. However, the results of operations included in these Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily be indicative of our annual results. Certain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were reclassified as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to conform with the current year presentation. Refer to Note 7 for further information. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation of our segment information in Note 10. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
  In August 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which eliminates diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2017 and do not anticipate that the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as simplifying classification in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2017. Upon adoption of this update, excess income tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, which are currently recognized within additional paid in capital, will be recognized within the income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Additionally, our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will present such excess income tax benefits, which are currently presented as a financing activity, as an operating activity. If we had adopted this update on January 1, 2016, the impact would have been   $31   through September 30, 2016. The impact of adopting this update in 2017 on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be dependent on market factors, the timing and intrinsic value of future share-based compensation award vests and exercises. 
  In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact that this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We plan to adopt this update on January 1, 2018. We are still evaluating the impact that this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

No other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective during the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  NOTE 2 - ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

    Dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 

NOTE 3 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  We use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow. At inception the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge or a free standing derivative. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We did not change our hedging strategies, accounting practices, or objectives from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015  .  
  Designated Net Investment Hedges  
  We have designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recognized in OCI and reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). On   September 30, 2016   the total after-tax amount in AOCI related to our designated net investment hedges was $  6  .  
  We use the forward method to measure ineffectiveness. Under this method the change in the carrying value of the Euro-denominated amounts, due to remeasurement of the effective portion, is reported as a component of AOCI. The remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in other income (expense), net. The gain or loss related to settled net investment hedges will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedges quarterly and did not recognize any ineffectiveness in the nine months 2016. 
  Designated and Non-Designated Hedges 

We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by our counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties. Should a counterparty default, our maximum exposure to loss is the asset balance of the instrument.  

Net Currency Exchange Rate Gains (Losses) 

On   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 pretax (losses) gains on derivatives designated as hedges of ($  25  ) and $  17  , reported in AOCI, were expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. There were no ineffective portions of derivatives that resulted in gains or losses in any of the periods presented. 
  Interest Rate Risk on Future Debt Issuance  
  Forward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt. The effective portion of the gains or losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is reported as a component of AOCI. Beginning in the period in which the debt refinancing occurs and the related derivative instruments is terminated, the effective portion of the gains or losses is then reclassified into interest expense over the term of the related debt. 
  On   September 30, 2016   we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $  600   designated as forward starting interest rate swaps in anticipation of future debt issuances. The market value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements on   September 30, 2016   was $  1  , which is recorded in other assets with an offsetting amount recorded in AOCI. Upon the probable issuance of the debt, these amounts will be released to interest expense over the term of the debt. The cash flow effect of this hedge is recorded in cash flow from operations.  
  In the nine months 2016 we terminated multiple designated interest rate cash flow hedges, recognized   $7   in OCI related to hedges on our debt issuances and recognized a nominal amount of ineffectiveness in interest expense. The remaining amounts in AOCI will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the debt. The cash flow effect of these hedges is recognized in cash flow from operations. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  On   September 30, 2016   we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of   $500   designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations representing a portion of our   $600   senior unsecured notes due in 2024. In the nine months 2016 there was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded as a result of these fair value hedges.

NOTE 4 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
                 Level 1 
    Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
      Level 2 
    Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
      Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs reflecting our assumptions or external inputs from active markets 

When applying the fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of identical or similar instruments, where available, or based on other observable inputs taking into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties. Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges are included in Level 2, as we use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. Our Level 3 liabilities represent milestone payments for acquisitions. For certain Level 3 liabilities, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the liabilities, while the fair value of other liabilities was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique. Significant unobservable inputs to this technique included our probability assessments related to the occurrence of certain events, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation. We remeasure the fair value of our assets and liabilities each reporting period. We record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense and the changes in the time value of money within other income (expense), net. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 

There were no significant transfers into or out of any level between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  .  
  Fair Value of Available for Sale Securities by Maturity 

On   September 30, 2016   the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was nominal. The total of interest and marketable securities income was $  7   and $  1   in the three months   2016   and   2015   and $  19   and $  12   in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . We record interest and marketable securities income in other income (expense), net. 
  Less than   1%   of our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than A2 (Moody's), A (Standard   Poor's) and A (Fitch). We do not plan to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. We do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired on   September 30, 2016  . Substantially all our investments with unrealized losses that were not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.

NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS 
  In April 2016 we completed the acquisition of Sage Products, LLC (Sage) for total consideration of approximately $  2,875  . Sage develops, manufactures and distributes disposable products used primarily in the intensive care unit. This acquisition enhanced our product offerings within our MedSurg segment. Purchase price allocations for this acquisition were based on preliminary valuations.  Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. 
  In April 2016 we completed the acquisition of Physio-Control International, Inc. (Physio) for total consideration of approximately $  1,299  , net of a working capital adjustment received during the three months 2016. Physio develops, manufactures and markets monitors/defibrillators, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and CPR-assist devices along with data management and support services. This acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment. Purchase price allocations for this acquisition were based on preliminary valuations. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. 
  The Other acquisitions in 2016 include the acquisition of Synergetics' neuro portfolio (Synergetics). The Synergetics acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment. Purchase price allocations for the Other acquisitions were based on preliminary valuations. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. 
  The Other acquisitions in 2015 include the acquisition of certain assets of CHG Hospital Beds, Inc. (CHG). The CHG acquisition enhances our product offerings within our MedSurg segment. The measurement period for CHG is complete. Revisions to the original purchase price allocation were nominal.

Goodwill acquired with the Sage, Synergetics and CHG acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. Supplemental pro forma combined statements of earnings have not been presented for the Sage and Physio acquisitions as the impact of their results of operations were not material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

NOTE 6 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS 
  We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters that are more fully described below. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.  We are self-insured for product liability claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us. On November 3, 2014 we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement to compensate  

eligible United States patients who had revision surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem prior to that date. We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries. In addition, some lawsuits remain and we continue to defend against them. Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter globally is currently estimated to be approximately $  1,915   to $   2,174   ($  2,147   to $  2,406   before $  232   of third-party insurance recoveries.) In the three months 2016 we recognized additional charges to earnings of $  45  , representing the excess of the minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves. We have made a total of $  1,483   of recall-related payments, including $  1,382   of settlement payments. The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict, including the number of enrollees in the settlement program and the total awards to them, the number and costs of patients not eligible for the settlement program who seek testing and treatment services and require revision surgery and the number and actual costs to resolve the remaining lawsuits. Accordingly, the ultimate cost to resolve this entire matter globally may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer) alleging that a Zimmer product infringed on    three   of our patents. In 2013 following a jury trial favorable to us, the trial judge entered a judgment that, among other things, awarded us damages of $  76   and ordered Zimmer to pay us enhanced damages. Zimmer appealed this ruling. In December 2014 the Federal Circuit affirmed the damages awarded to us, reversed the order for enhanced damages and remanded the issue of attorney fees to the trial court. In May 2015 the trial court entered a stipulated judgment that, among other things, required Zimmer to pay us the base amount of damages and interest, while the issues of enhanced damages and attorney fees continue to be pursued. In June 2015 we recorded a $  54   gain, net of legal costs, which was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. On June 13, 2016 the United States Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Federal Circuit that reversed our judgment for enhanced damages and remanded the case to the Federal Circuit to reconsider the issue. On September 12, 2016 the Federal Circuit issued an opinion that,among other things, remanded the issue of enhanced damages to the trial court. 
  In April 2011 Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) brought a lawsuit against us alleging infringement under United States patent laws with respect to   nine   patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds. On March 31, 2015 the court granted the parties  joint motion to dismiss with prejudice the claims and counterclaims associated with   three   of these patents. The case has been stayed with respect to the remaining   six   patents until reexamination proceedings at the United States Patent Office have concluded. The ultimate resolution of this matter cannot be predicted and it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any probable loss or range of probable losses; however, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

    Dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 

NOTE 7 - DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES 
  In March 2016 we sold   $3,500   of senior unsecured notes. In September 2016 we repaid all   $750   of our senior unsecured notes that were due on September 30, 2016. 
  In September 2016 we increased the amount of commercial paper issuable under the commercial paper program by   $250   to a maximum of   $1,500   outstanding with maturities up to   397   days from the date of issuance. On   September 30, 2016   outstanding commercial paper totaled   $100  , the weighted-average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately     50   days, and the weighted average annualized interest rate of short-term debt was approximately   0.7%  .  
  We have lines of credit issued by various financial institutions that are available to fund our day-to-day operating needs. In August 2016 we entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility that replaces our previous agreement dated August 29, 2014. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the commitments by $  250   to   $1,500   and to extend the maturity date to August 19, 2021. 
  Certain of our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants on   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table is a summary of our total debt and other debt information. 

The fair value of debt (excluding the interest rate hedge) was based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowings. Substantially all of our debt was classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the debt was estimated using rates with identical terms and maturities based on quoted active market prices and yields, which took into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.  
  On January 1, 2016 we retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The adoption of this update resulted in the reclassification of $24 of unamortized debt issuance costs, principally from other noncurrent assets, to a reduction of long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets on December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 8 - CAPITAL STOCK  
  In February 2016 we declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.38   per share payable on April 30, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2016. In April 2016 we declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.38   per share payable on July 29, 2016 to shareholders at the close of business on June 30, 2016. In July 2016 we declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.38   per share payable on October 31, 2016 to shareholders at the close of business on   September 30, 2016  . 
  In the nine months 2016,   135 thousand   shares, repurchased at the end of 2015, were settled at a cost of $  13   under our authorized repurchase programs. The manner, timing and amount of repurchases is determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and is subject to regulatory considerations. Purchases are made from time-to-time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. On   September 30, 2016   the total dollar value of shares that could be acquired under our authorized repurchase programs was $  1,870  . We have suspended our share repurchase program through the remainder of 2016. 
   
  NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES 
  Our effective tax rates were   15.2%   and   12.8%   in the three months 2016 and 2015 and   14.7%   and   18.3%   in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increase in the effective income tax rate in the three months 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the jurisdictional allocation of tax expense related to recall matters in the three months 2015. The effective income tax rate in the nine months 2016 decreased primarily due to certain discrete tax items in 2015 related to the establishment of our European regional headquarters. 
   
  NOTE 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION    
  The following table is a summary of our results of operations by reportable segment. 

Total assets of our MedSurg segment increased to $  8,724   as a result of our recent acquisitions as discussed in Note 5. There were no other significant changes to total assets by segment from information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015.

Excluding the 1.1% impact of acquisitions, net sales in constant currency increased by 10.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.5% due to lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of neurotechnology products. 
  Gross Profit 
  Gross profit as a percentage of sales in the three months decreased to 66.1% from 67.1% in 2015, primarily due to the impact of the sale of inventory stepped up to fair value in connection with our recent acquisitions and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in the three months was partially offset by the favorable impact of the two-year suspension of the United States medical device excise tax that became effective January 1, 2016.

    Dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 

Gross profit in the nine months increased to 66.2% from 66.1% in 2015, primarily due to suspension of the United States medical device excise tax. We expect this favorable impact to gross profit as a result of the suspension of the United States medical device excise tax to continue through 2017. 

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses 
  Research, development and engineering expenses increased $29 or 18.7% in the three months to 6.5% of sales compared to 6.4% in   2015  . These expenses increased $65 or 14.1% in the nine months and were 6.4% of sales in   2016   and   2015  . Recent acquisitions and the timing of spending on projects and investments in new technologies contributed to the increased spending levels.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $170 or 19.2% in the three months to 37.3% of sales compared to 36.7% in   2015  . Excluding the impact of the charges noted below, expenses decreased to 34.8% of sales compared to 35.6% in   2015  , primarily due to disciplined expense management, partially offset by the impact of our recent acquisitions and higher sales performance-related compensation costs.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $404 or 15.3% in the nine months to 37.3% of sales compared to 36.5% in   2015  . Excluding the impact of the charges noted below, expenses decreased slightly to 35.7% of sales compared to 35.9% in   2015  , primarily due to disciplined expense management, partially offset by the impact of our recent acquisitions, increased compensation costs due in part to sales performance-related compensation and expenses associated with the development of a global enterprise resource planning system.  

Recall Charges 
  Recall charges were $57 and $150 in the three months and $104 and $316 in the nine months of   2016   and   2015  . The charges primarily relate to the previously disclosed Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems voluntary recalls. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
  Amortization of Intangible Assets 
  Amortization of intangible assets was $89 and $54 in the three months and $230 and $152 in the nine months of   2016   and   2015  . The increases were due primarily to our recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
  Other income (expense), net was ($67) and ($33) in the three months and ($172) and ($90) in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increases were primarily driven by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels as a result of our March 2016 debt offering.  
  Income Taxes 
  The effective income tax rate on earnings was 15.2% and 12.8% in the three months and 14.7% and 18.3% in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increase in the effective income tax rate in the three months 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the jurisdictional allocation of tax expense related to recall matters in the three months 2015. The effective income tax rate in the nine months 2016 decreased primarily due to certain discrete tax items in 2015 related to the establishment of our European regional headquarters. 
  Net Earnings 
  Net earnings increased to $355 or $0.94 per diluted share in the three months from $301 or $0.79 per diluted share in   2015  . Adjusted net earnings per diluted share increased 11.2% to $1.39 in the three months from $1.25 in   2015  . The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net earnings reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03 and $0.06 in the three months   2016   and   2015  . 
  Net earnings increased to $1,137 or $3.01 per diluted share in the nine months from $917 or $2.40 per diluted share in   2015  . Adjusted net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $4.02 in the nine months from $3.56 in   2015  . The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net earnings reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.08 and $0.20 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  .

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
  We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Diluted EPS). We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.  
  To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.  

To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period: 
           1. 
    Acquisition and integration-related costs  . Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process. 
              2. 
    Amortization of purchased intangible assets  . Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.  
              3. 
    Restructuring-related charges  . Costs associated with focused workforce reductions and other restructuring activities. 
              4. 
    Rejuvenate and other recall matters  . Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls. 
              5. 
    Regulatory and legal matters  . Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.  
              6. 
    Tax matters  . Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters.  
     Since non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of purchased intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our Consolidated Financial Statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   

  Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operations which is primarily comprised of net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes) was $1,164 and $228 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increase in cash from operations in 2016 was primarily due to lower Rejuvenate and ABG II recall-related payments compared to 2015, which was partially offset by higher levels of inventory in 2016. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $296 and $83 of cash in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increase in consumption was due to higher inventory purchases in 2016. 
  Investing Activities       
  Cash used in investing activities was $4,014 for 2016 primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions. Cash provided by investing activities was $2,541 in   2015   due to the sale of marketable securities in preparation for recall-related payments.  

Acquisitions, Net of Cash Acquired:   Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $4,296 and $140 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . In 2016 we acquired Sage, Physio, Synergetics and certain other businesses and related assets. In   2015   the primary acquisition was CHG. 
  Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment:   Purchases of property, plant and equipment were $347 and $191 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . The increase is primarily due to capital expenditures associated with our global ERP system and the construction of a dedicated additive manufacturing facility. 
  Marketable Securities, Net:   Net cash provided by the sale of marketable securities was $633 and $2,872 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . 
  Other Investing, Net:     Net cash used for other investing activities of $4 is primarily related to investments made during the quarter. 
  Financing Activities 
  Dividends Paid:   Dividends paid per common share were $1.14 and $1.035 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $426 and $391 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . 
  Borrowings and Repayments of Debt:   Net proceeds from borrowings were $2,818 in the nine months 2016, primarily from the issuance of $3,500 of senior unsecured notes in March 2016 partially offset by payment of $750 of senior unsecured notes due in September 2016. Net repayments of debt were $501 in 2015 as  

13 
      
    Dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 

we repaid our senior unsecured notes that were due on January 15, 2015. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
  Repurchases of Common Stock  :   Repurchases of common stock were $13 and $446 in the nine months   2016   and   2015  . We have suspended our share repurchase program through the remainder of 2016. 
  Liquidity 
  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,022 and $4,079 on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,340 and $4,441 on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and Rejuvenate and ABG II recall-related payments from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. As a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March of 2016, Moody's downgraded our unsecured note ratings to Baa1 from A3, and Standard   Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A from A+ and our short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+. Nevertheless we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.  
  We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. In August 2016 we increased the borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility by $250 to a maximum of $1,500. In September 2016 we increased the amount of commercial paper issuable under the commercial paper program by $250 to a maximum of $1,500. 
  On   September 30, 2016   approximately 83% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the United States compared to 46% on December 31, 2015. Our cash held in locations outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.  
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  There were no changes to our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015  .  
  New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted  
  Refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information. 
  Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. 
   
  OTHER MATTERS 
  Legal and Regulatory Matters 
  As further described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded additional charges to earnings of $45 representing the excess of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls over the previously recorded reserves. Based on the information that has been received the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $1,915 to $2,174 ($2,147  to $2,406 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries). The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate  

and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Reform Act, are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "would," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these statements.  
  Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include those risks discussed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015  . This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015  . 
   
                 ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We consider our greatest potential area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about exchange rate risk are included in the "Other Information" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   2015   under the caption "Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments." There were no material changes from the information provided therein.  
   
                 ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
