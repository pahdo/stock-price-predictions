      Note 1.  Overview and B  asis of Presentation    
 Description of Business and Separation 
   
 The principal business of LSC Communications, Inc. ( LSC Communications,   the Company,   we,   our  and  us ) is to offer a broad scope of print and print-related capabilities.  The Company serves the needs of publishers, merchandisers and retailers worldwide with a portfolio of products, services and technology solutions that includes print, office products, publishing, mail-list management, e-services, warehousing, fulfillment services and supply chain management.  LSC Communications prints magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories and its office products offerings include filing products, note-taking products, binders, tax and stock forms and envelopes.         
    
    On October 1, 2016 (the  separation date ), R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company ( RRD  or the  Parent ) completed the previously announced separation (the  separation ) into three separate independent publicly-traded companies: (i) its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business ( LSC Communications  (ii) its financial communications services business ( Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.  or  Donnelley Financial ) and (iii) a global, customized multichannel communications management company, which is the business of RRD after the separation.  To effect the separation, RRD undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities.  RRD completed the distribution (the  distribution ) of 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial to RRD shareholders on October 1, 2016.  RRD retained a 19.25% ownership stake in both LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial.  On October 1, 2016, RRD shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016 received one share of LSC Communications common stock and one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the distribution, LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial are now independent publicly-traded companies and began regular way trading under the symbols  LKSD  and  DFIN,  respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  RRD remains an independent publicly-traded company trading under the symbol  RRD  on the New York Stock Exchange.      
         
  In connection with the separation, LSC Communications, RRD and Donnelley Financial entered into commercial arrangements and transition services agreements.  Under the terms of the commercial arrangements, RRD will continue to provide, among other things, logistics, premedia, production and sales services to LSC Communications.  In addition, LSC Communications will continue to provide sales support services to RRD s Asia and Mexico print and graphics management businesses in order to facilitate the importing of books and related products to the U.S. RRD will also provide LSC Communications certain global outsourcing, technical support and other services.  LSC Communications will also continue to provide print and bind services for Donnelley Financial.    
   
  Under the terms of the transition services agreements, RRD will provide certain services to LSC Communications and LSC Communications will provide certain services to RRD and Donnelley Financial, including, but not limited to, in such areas as tax, information technology, treasury, internal audit, human resources, accounting, purchasing, communications, security and compensation and benefits.  These agreements facilitated the separation by allowing LSC Communications to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office systems across its organization.  Transition services may be provided for up to twenty-four months following the separation.    
     
  The Company and RRD also entered into:    

A   separation and distribution agreement which accomplished the distribution of LSC Communications  common stock and the distribution of Donnelley Financial s common stock to RRD s common stockholders, and which governs the Company s relationships with RRD and Donnelley Financial with respect to pre-separation matters and provides for the allocation of employee benefit, litigation and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation;     

A Tax Disaffiliation Agreement that allocates responsibility for taxes between LSC Communications and RRD and includes indemnification rights with respect to tax matters and restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the separation; and       

A Patent Assignment and License Agreement, a Trademark Assignment and License Agreement, a Data Assignment and License Agreement and a Software, Copyright and Trade Secret Assignment and License Agreement, in each case, that will provide for ownership, licensing and other arrangements to facilitate RRD s, Donnelley Financial s and the Company s ongoing use of intellectual property, as applicable.

  Final copies of such agreements were filed as exhibits to   the Company s Form 8-K filed on October 3, 2016.  
   
   Basis of Presentation   
   
 The financial data presented herein is unaudited.  In the opinion of management, the financial data presented includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  Results of interim periods should not be considered indicative of the results of the full year. 
   
 The accompanying Condensed Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from RRD s consolidated financial statements and accounting records.  The Condensed Combined Financial Statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).   
 All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.  All intracompany transactions between LSC Communications, RRD and Donnelley Financial are considered to be effectively settled in the Condensed Combined Financial Statements at the time the transaction is recorded.  The total net effect of the settlement of these intracompany transactions is reflected in the Condensed Combined Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity and in the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets as net parent company investment.  Net parent company investment is primarily impacted by contributions from RRD which are the result of treasury activities and net funding provided by or distributed to RRD.      
 The Condensed Combined Financial Statements include certain expenses of RRD which were allocated to LSC Communications for certain corporate functions, including healthcare and pension benefits, information technology, finance, legal, human resources, internal audit, treasury, tax, investor relations and executive oversight.  These expenses have been allocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage, when available, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis by revenue, employee headcount, or other measures. The Company considers the allocation methodologies and results to be reasonable for all periods presented; however, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that LSC Communications would have incurred as an independent public company or the costs it may incur in the future. 
   
 The income tax amounts in these combined financial statements have been calculated based on a separate income tax return methodology and presented as if the Company s operations were separate taxpayers in the respective jurisdictions.  
   
 RRD maintains various benefit and share-based compensation plans at a corporate level.  LSC Communications  employees participate in those programs and a portion of the cost of such plans is included in LSC Communications  Condensed Combined Financial Statements.  However, LSC Communications  Condensed Combined Balance Sheets do not include any equity related to share-based compensation plans or any net benefit plan obligations unless the benefit plan covers only active and inactive LSC Communications employees. 
   
 LSC Communications generates a portion of its net sales from sales to RRD s subsidiaries.  Additionally, LSC Communications utilizes RRD for freight and logistics when shipping finished goods to its customers.  Refer to Note 14,  Related Parties , for more information. 

Note 2.  Business Combination 
 2015 Acquisition 
 On June 8, 2015, RRD acquired Courier Corporation ( Courier ), a leader in digital printing and publishing primarily in the United States, specializing in educational, religious and trade books. The acquisition expanded the Company s digital printing capabilities. Courier s book manufacturing operations and publishing operations are included in LSC Communications  combined financial statements.  Courier s Brazilian operations are not part of LSC Communications; therefore, the Company s combined financial statements do not include Courier s Brazilian operations. The purchase price for Courier was $137.3 million in cash and 8.0 million shares of RRD common stock, or a total transaction value of $291.5 million (including $5.8 million related to Brazil) based on RRD s closing share price on June 5, 2015, plus the assumption of Courier s debt of $78.2 million (including $1.7 million related to Brazil).  Courier had $20.9 million (including $0.4 million related to Brazil) of cash as of the date of acquisition.  Immediately following the acquisition, substantially all of the debt assumed was repaid.

 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 (tabular amounts in millions, except per share data) 
   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $0.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively, of a  cquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Courier within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Combined Statements of Income.  
   
 The Courier acquisition was recorded by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired, including other intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  The excess of the cost over the net amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill associated with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisition.    
       The tax deductible goodwill related to Courier was $7.5 million.  
   
       Based on the valuation, the final purchase price  allocation for the Courier acquisition was as follows: 

The fair values of other intangible assets, technology and goodwill associated with the acquisition of Courier were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.  The following table presents the fair value, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs for these Level 3 measurements: 

The fair values of property, plant and equipment associated with the Courier acquisition were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy and were estimated using either the market approach, if a secondhand market existed, or cost approach.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $1.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively.  Additionally, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included net restructuring charges of $1.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, for employee termination costs for an aggregate of 48 employees, all of whom were terminated as of or prior to September 30, 2016.  These charges primarily related to one facility closure in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also recorded impairment of ($0.9) million and $0.5 million, respectively, primarily related to buildings, machinery and equipment associated with facility closures.  The amount recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflects a change to an impairment charge recorded earlier in 2016. 
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $14.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively, for employee termination costs for 750 employees, substantially all of whom were terminated as of or prior to September 30, 2016.  These charges primarily related to the announcement of three facility closures, two in the Print segment and one in the Office Products segment, the closure of another facility in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recorded $7.7 million and $8.3 million of net impairment charges primarily related to machinery and equipment and buildings associated with facility closings.  Additionally, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $2.3 million and $4.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   

Other Charges  
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded other charges of $0.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations unrelated to facility closures. The total liability for the withdrawal obligations associated with the Company s decision to withdraw from certain multi-employer pension plans included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities are $5.7 million and $40.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016.   
   
 The Company s withdrawal liabilities could be affected by the financial stability of other employers participating in such plans and any decisions by those employers to withdraw from such plans in the future. While it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of future events or circumstances, reductions in other employers  participation in multi-employer pension plans, including certain plans from which the Company has previously withdrawn, could have a material effect on the Company s previously estimated withdrawal liabilities, combined results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded other charges of $0.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively,  including integration charges of $19.1 million for payments made to certain Courier employees upon the termination of Courier s executive severance plan immediately prior to the acquisition.

 (tabular amounts in millions, except per share data) 
   
  Restructuring Reserve   
 The restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were as follows: 

The current portion of restructuring reserves of $9.2 million at September 30, 2016 was included in accrued liabilities, while the long-term portion of $16.4 million, which primarily related to multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations related to facility closures and lease termination costs, was included in other noncurrent liabilities at September 30, 2016.  
   
 The Company anticipates that payments associated with the employee terminations reflected in the above table will be substantially completed by September 2017. 
   
 Payments on all of the Company s multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations are scheduled to be completed by 2034. Changes based on uncertainties in these estimated withdrawal obligations could affect the ultimate charges related to multi-employer pension plan withdrawals.  
   
 The restructuring liabilities classified as  lease terminations and other  consisted of lease terminations and other facility closing costs. Payments on certain of the lease obligations are scheduled to continue until 2018. Market conditions and the Company s ability to sublease these properties could affect the ultimate charges related to the lease obligations.  Any potential recoveries or additional charges could affect amounts reported in the Company s financial statements.  

Note 7.  Retirement Plans 
   
 The components of the estimated net pension benefits plan income for certain plans in the United Kingdom, Mexico and from the acquisitions of Esselte Corporation ( Esselte ) and Courier for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company communicated to certain former Esselte Corporation employees the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity with payments computed in accordance with statutory requirements, beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Payments to eligible participants who elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity were funded from existing pension plan assets and constituted a complete settlement of the Company s pension liabilities with respect to these participants. The Company s pension assets and liabilities were remeasured as of the payout date. The discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate the payouts were determined in accordance with federal regulations. As of the remeasurement date, the reduction in the reported pension obligation for these participants was $35.1 million, compared to payout amounts of approximately $30.5 million . The Company recorded non-cash settlement charges of $0.5 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2016 in connection with the settlement payments. These charges resulted from the recognition in earnings of a portion of the actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss based on the proportion of the obligation settled.

 Basic and diluted earnings per common share and the average number of common shares outstanding were retrospectively restated for the number of LSC Communications shares outstanding immediately following this transaction.  The same number of shares was used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share since there were no LSC Communications equity awards outstanding prior to the spinoff.

Note 11.  Segment Information    
   
 The Company s segment and product and service offerings are summarized below: 
   
 Print 
   
   The Print segment produces magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories.  The segment also provides supply-chain management and certain other print-related services, including mail-list management and sortation, e-book formatting and distribution.  The segment has operations in the U.S., Europe and Mexico.   The print segment is divided into the magazines, catalog and retail inserts, book, Europe and directories reporting units.    
   
 Office Products  
   
 The Office Products segment manufactures and sell branded and private label products in five core categories:  filing products, note-taking products, binder products, forms and envelopes.    
 Corporate 
   
  Corporate consists of unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and LIFO inventory provisions.  In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefit plan income and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Prior to the separation, many of these costs were based on allocations from RRD; however, the Company will incur such costs directly upon the completion of the separation.

  Note 12.  Commitments and Contingencies   
   
 The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company accrues for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change and are generally not discounted. The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party or has received claims in nine active federal and state Superfund and other multiparty remediation sites. In addition to these sites, the Company may also have the obligation to remediate four other previously and currently owned facilities. At the Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act provides that the Company s liability could be joint and several, meaning that the Company could be required to pay an amount in excess of its proportionate share of the remediation costs.  
 The Company s understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the multiparty sites and of other liable parties at the previously owned facilities has been considered, where appropriate, in the determination of the Company s estimated liability. The Company established reserves, recorded in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, that it believes are adequate to cover its share of the potential costs of remediation at each of the multiparty sites and the previously and currently owned facilities. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material effect on the Company s combined results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
   
 From time to time, the Company s customers and others file voluntary petitions for reorganization under United States bankruptcy laws. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company from these parties could be considered preference items and subject to return. In addition, the Company may be party to certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the final resolution of these preference items and litigation will not have a material effect on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income, Balance Sheets and Cash Flows.   

Note 13.  Debt 
   
 The Company s debt at September 30, 2016 consisted of the following: 

(a)   
 
 The borrowings under the term loan facility are subject to a variable interest rate. As of September 30, 2016 the interest rate was 7.00%.    

 __________________________________ 
   
 On September 30, 2016, the Company issued $450.0 million of 8.75% Senior Secured Notes (the  Senior Notes ) due October 15, 2023.  Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2017.  Net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes ( the Notes Offering ) were distributed to RRD in the form of a dividend.  The Company did not retain any proceeds from the Notes Offering.

LSC Communications, Inc. 
 Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 (tabular amounts in millions, except per share data) 
   
  The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture where certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the Senior Notes   (the  Guarantors ).  The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors, which are comprised of each of the Company s existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. sub  sidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations. The Senior Notes are not guaranteed by the Company s foreign subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries.  The Senior Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a first-priority lien basis by the colla  teral, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The Indenture governing the Senior Notes contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including limitations on: (1) liens; (2) indebtedness; (3) mergers, con  solidations and acquisitions; (4) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (5) loans and other investments; (6) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (7) restrictions affecting subsidi  aries; (8) transactions with affiliates; and (9) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.  The Senior Notes mature on October 15, 2023.  
   
 On September 30, 2016 the Company entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) which provides for (i) a new senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $375.0 million (the  Term Loan Facility ) and (ii) a new senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the  Revolving Credit Facility, ).  The interest rate per annum applicable to the Term Loan Facility is equal to, at the Company s option, either a base rate plus a margin of 5.00% or LIBOR plus a margin of 6.00%. The LIBOR rate is subject to a  floor  of 1%.  The interest rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility is equal to a base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25%, in either case based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries.  Interest on the Credit Agreement is due at least quarterly commencing on December 31, 2016.  The Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments of $12.5 million for the first eight quarters and $10.6 million for subsequent quarters.  The debt issuance costs and original issue discount are being amortized over the life of the facilities using the effective interest method. The Term Loan Facility will mature on September 30, 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 30, 2021. 
   
 The proceeds of any collection or other realization of collateral received in connection with the exercise of remedies and any distribution in respect of collateral in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied first to repay amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility before the lenders under the Term Loan Facility or the holders of the Senior Notes receive such proceeds.  
   
 The Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $50.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 
   
  The Company has used the net proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to fund a cash dividend to RRD in connection with the spin off and to pay fees and expenses related to the spin off from RRD.  The Company intends to use any additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities for general corporate purposes, including the financing of permitted investments. 
   
 There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. 

Note 14:  Related Parties  
   
 The Company has not historically operated as a stand-alone business and has various relationships with RRD whereby RRD and the Company provide services to RRD and its affiliates.

  Allocations from RRD   
   
 RRD provided LSC Communications certain services, which include, but are not limited to, information technology, finance, legal, human resources, internal audit, treasury, tax, investor relations and executive oversight. The financial information in these Condensed Combined Financial Statements does not necessarily include all the expenses that would have been incurred had LSC Communications been a separate, stand-alone entity. RRD charged the Company for these services based on direct usage, when available, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis by revenue, headcount, or other measures.  These allocations were reflected as follows in the Condensed Combined Financial Statements: 

The Company considers the expense methodologies and financial results to be reasonable for all periods presented.  However, these allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses that may have been incurred as an independent public company or the costs LSC Communications may incur in the future. 

Related Party Revenues 
 LSC Communications generates a portion of net revenue from sales to RRD s subsidiaries and Donnelley Financial.  Net revenues from intercompany sales of $19.4 million and $15.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $54.7 million and $50.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were included in the Condensed Combined Statements of Income. 

Related Party Purchases 
   
  LSC Communications utilizes RRD for freight, logistics and premedia when shipping finished goods to its customers.  Included in the Condensed Combined Financial Statements were costs of sales related to freight, logistics and premedia services purchased from RRD of $43.1 million and $53.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $135.3 million and $156.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Intercompany receivables and payables with RRD are reflected within net parent company investment in the Condensed Combined Financial Statements.  

Share-Based Compensation 
   
 LSC Communications employees participated in RRD s share-based compensation plans, the costs of which have been allocated to LSC Communications and recorded in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses in the Condensed Combined Statements of Income. Share-based compensation costs allocated to the Company were $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.3 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

  Retirement Plans  
   
 Employees participated in various pension and other postretirement healthcare plans sponsored by RRD .   In LSC Communications  Condensed Combined Financial Statements these plans are accounted for as multi-employer benefit plans and as a result the related net benefit obligations are not reflected in LSC Communications  Condensed Combined Balance Sheets. At the separation date, LSC Communications expects to record net benefit plan obligations transferred from RRD.  LSC Communications  Condensed Combined Statements of Income include income and expense allocations for these benefits. These allocations were funded through intercompany transactions with RRD which are reflected within the net parent company investment in LSC Communications .  
   
  Refer to Note 17,   Subsequent Events  , for information on the pension plans after the separation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
   
  RRD uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations.  The majority of the Company s domestic and foreign subsidiaries were parties to RRD s cash pooling arrangements to maximize the availability of cash for general operating and investing purposes.  As part of RRD s centralized cash management processes, cash balances were swept regularly from the Company s accounts.  Cash transfers to and from RRD s cash concentration and cash pooling accounts and the resulting balances at the end of each reporting period are reflected in net parent company investment in the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets.    Cash and cash equivalents held by RRD were not allocated to LSC Communications unless they were held in a legal entity that was transferred to LSC Communications.  

Debt 
   
 RRD s third party debt and related interest expense have not been allocated to the Company for any of the periods presented as the Company was not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings were not directly related to the Company s business.   
   
 The debt recorded by LSC Communications as of September 30, 2016 was issued directly by the Company.  Refer to Note 13,  Debt , for further information. 

Note 15: Uncertain Tax Positions 
   
 The changes in the Company s unrecognized tax benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

The 2016 settlements reflect a payment of $4.6 million related to the receipt in 2015 of an unfavorable court decision related to payment of prior year taxes in an international jurisdiction.

  Note 16:  New Accounting Pronouncements    
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )  issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU2016-15 ), which provided guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues to reduce existing diversity in practice. The standard becomes effective in the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption of ASU 2016-15 is permitted; however the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect a significant impact to presentation on its Condensed Combined Statement of Cash Flows.    
   
 In February 2016, the FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842) Section A Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to put most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expense on the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, ASU 2016-02 also modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard requires a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective in the first quarter of 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted; however the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02.   
   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue using a five-step process that supersedes virtually all existing revenue guidance. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to January 1, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2014-09 is permitted in the first quarter of 2017.  However, the Company plans to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018.  
 The standard allows the option of either a full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or a modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and currently anticipates applying the modified retrospective approach when adopting the standard.   

Note 17. Subsequent Events  
   
  On October 1, 2016, the Company assumed certain assets and liabilities which were distributed as part of the separation from RRD.  As part of this distribution, the Company assumed certain workers  compensation liabilities of $38.9 million, of which $11.2 million was short-term and $27.7 million was long-term, and a workers  compensation recovery asset of $3.8 million.    
   
  In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, there will be a cash adjustment payable to RRD or receivable from RRD for the September 30, 2016 cash balance greater or less than an agreed-upon target cash balance of $30.0 million as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. The Separation and Distribution   A  greement also includes a provision for RRD to make a future cash payment of $10.0 million to LSC Communications no later than April 1, 2017.  
   
  The Company also assumed certain pension obligations and plans assets in single employer plans for the Company s employees and certain former employees and retirees of RRD.   The Company recorded a net benefit plan obligation of $358.2 million as of October 1, 2016 related to these plans.     The Company s primary defined benefit plans are frozen. No new employees will be permitted to enter the Company s frozen plans and participants will earn no additional benefits  .   The defined benefit pension plans transferred to LSC Communications include a plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (the  Qualified Plan ) and related non-qualified benefits (the  Non-Qualified Plan ).      The Qualified Plan will be funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations, such that the Company funds at least the minimum amount required using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations.  The Non-Qualified Plan is unfunded, and the Company pays retiree benefits as they become due.

 For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 (tabular amounts in millions, except per share data) 
   
  Information about the obligations and assets of the Qualified and Non-Qualified Plans as of September 30, 2016 is shown below.  

The pension benefit obligations were calculated using generally accepted actuarial methods.  Actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average remaining life of active plan participants.   
   
 The Company uses a risk management approach for its U.S. pension plan assets. The overall investment objective of this approach is to further reduce the risk of significant decreases in the plan s funded status by allocating a larger portion of the plan s assets to investments expected to hedge the impact of interest rate risks on the plan s obligation. Over time, the target asset allocation percentage for the pension plan is expected to decrease for equity and other  return seeking  investments and increase for fixed income and other  hedging  investments. The assumed long-term rate of return for plan assets is currently 7.3%. This rate is determined annually, and is likely to decrease as the asset allocation shifts over time. The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums. The target asset allocation percentage as of December 31, 2015, for the primary U.S. pension plan was approximately 60.0% for return seeking investments and approximately 40.0% for hedging investments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
 The following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of LSC Communications, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Combined Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Item 1. Condensed Combined Financial Statements. Refer to the company s Information Statement included as Exhibit 99.1 to the company s effective Registration Statement on Form 10, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2016 ( Information Statement ) for management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the company as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Company Overview and Separation 
   
 The principal business of LSC Communications, Inc. ( LSC Communications,   the Company,   we,   our  and  us ) is to offer a broad scope of print and print-related capabilities.  The Company serves the needs of publishers, merchandisers and retailers worldwide with a portfolio of products, services and technology solutions that includes print, office products, publishing, mail-list management, e-services, warehousing, fulfillment services and supply chain management.  LSC Communications prints magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories and its office products offerings include filing products, note-taking products, binders, tax and stock forms and envelopes.  
   
    On October 1, 2016 (the  separation date ), R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company ( RRD  or the  Parent ) completed the previously announced separation (the  separation ) into three separate independent publicly-traded companies: (i) its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business ( LSC Communications  (ii) its financial communications services business ( Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.  or  Donnelley Financial ) and (iii) a global, customized multichannel communications management company, which is the business of RRD after the separation.  To effect the separation, RRD undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities.  RRD completed the distribution (the  distribution ) of 80.75%, of the outstanding common stock of LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial to RRD shareholders on October 1, 2016.  RRD retained a 19.25% ownership stake in both LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial.  On October 1, 2016, RRD shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 23, 2016 received one share of LSC Communications common stock and one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held as of the record date. As a result of the distribution, LSC Communications and Donnelley Financial are now independent publicly-traded companies and began regular way trading under the symbols  LKSD  and  DFIN,  respectively, on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  RRD remains an independent publicly-traded company trading under the symbol  RRD  on the New York Stock Exchange.   
   
  In connection with the separation, LSC Communications, RRD and Donnelley Financial entered into commercial arrangements and transition services agreements.  Under the terms of the commercial arrangements, RRD will continue to provide, among other things, logistics, premedia, production and sales services to LSC Communications.  In addition, LSC Communications will continue to provide sales support services to RRD s Asia and Mexico print and graphics management businesses in order to facilitate the importing of books and related products to the U.S. RRD will also provide LSC Communications certain global outsourcing, technical support and other services.  LSC Communications will also continue to provide print and bind services for Donnelley Financial.    
   
  Under the terms of the transition services agreements, RRD will provide certain services to LSC Communications and LSC Communications will provide certain services to RRD and Donnelley Financial, including, but not limited to, in such areas as tax, information technology, treasury, internal audit, human resources, accounting, purchasing, communications, security and compensation and benefits.  These agreements facilitated the separation by allowing LSC Communications to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office systems across its organization.  Transition services may be provided for up to twenty-four months following the separation.    
     
  The Company and RRD also entered into:  

A   separation and distribution agreement which accomplished the distribution of LSC Communications  common stock and the distribution of Donnelley Financial s common stock to RRD s common stockholders, and which governs the Company s relationships with RRD and Donnelley Financial with respect to pre-separation matters and provides for the allocation of employee benefit, litigation and other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation;     

A Tax Disaffiliation Agreement that allocates responsibility for taxes between LSC Communications and RRD and includes indemnification rights with respect to tax matters and restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the separation; and      

 25 

A Patent Assignment and License Agreement, a Trademark A  ssignment and License Agreement, a Data Assignment and License Agreement and a Software, Copyright and Trade Secret Assignment and License Agreement, in each case, that will provide for ownership, licensing and other arrangements to facilitate RRD s, Donne  lley Financial s and the Company s ongoing use of intellectual property, as applicable.       

Final copies of such agreements were filed as exhibits to  the Company s Form 8-K filed on October 3, 2016.  

Segment Descriptions 
   
 The Company s segments and their product offerings are summarized below: 
   
 Print 
   
 The Print segment produces magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, and directories.  The segment also provides supply-chain management and certain other print-related services, including mail-list management and sortation, e-book formatting and distribution.  The segment has operations in the U.S., Europe and Mexico.   The print segment is divided into the magazines, catalog and retail inserts, book, Europe and directories reporting units. 
   
 Office Products  
   
 The Office Products segment manufactures and sell branded and private label products in five core categories:  filing products, note-taking products, binder products, forms and envelopes. 
   
 Corporate 
   
 Corporate consists of unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and LIFO inventory provisions.  In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefit plan income and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Prior to the separation, many of these costs were based on allocations from RRD; however, the Company will incur such costs directly upon the completion of the separation.   

Business Acquisition 
   
 On June 8, 2015, RRD acquired Courier Corporation ( Courier ), a leader in digital printing and publishing primarily in the United States, specializing in educational, religious and trade books. 
   
 For further information on the above acquisition, see Note 2,  Business Combination , to the Condensed Combined Financial Statements.   

OUTLOOK 
   
 Competitive Environment  
 The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive. Despite consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented.  Across the Company s range of Print segment products and services, competition is based primarily on the ability to deliver products for the lowest total cost, a factor driven not only by price, but also materials and distribution costs. We expect that prices for print products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years. 
   
 26 

In addition to direct competition from within the industry, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet   technologies, continue to impact the market for our products and services. The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products. Digital technologies have impacted printed magazines, as some advertising spending has moved from print to   electronic media. In addition, catalogs and retail inserts have experienced volume reductions as our customers allocate more of their spending to online resources and also face stiff competition from online retailers resulting in retailer compression and s  tore closures. Electronic   communication and transaction technology has also continued to drive electronic substitution in directory printing, in part driven by cost pressures at key customers. E-book substitution has impacted overall consumer print book vo  lume, although e-book adoption   rates are stabilizing and industry-wide print book volume has been growing in recent years. The future impact of technology on our business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure im  pacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, we have made targeted acquisitions and investments in our existing business to offer customers innovative services and solutions. Such acquisitions and investments include the acquisition of Couri  er Corporation in 2015, which expanded our book fulfillment and digital printing capabilities. This and other targeted acquisitions and investments further secure our position as a technology leader in the industry.  
   
 Technological advancement and innovation has affected the overall demand for most of the products in our Office Products segment. While these changes continue to impact demand, the overall market for our products remains large and share growth is attainable. We compete against a range of both domestic and international competitors in each of our product categories within the segment. Due to the increasing percentage of private label products in the market, resellers have created a highly competitive environment where purchasing decisions are based largely on price, quality and the supplier s ability to service the customer. As consumer preferences shift towards private label, resellers have increased the pressure on suppliers to better differentiate their product offering, often times through product exclusivity, product innovation and development of private label products. 
   
 LSC Communications has implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities. Future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities. Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial.  Management also reviews the LSC Communications  operations and management structure on a regular basis to balance appropriate risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support the Company s long-term strategic goals.  

Seasonality 
   
 Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by LSC Communications. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy.  The seasonal pattern in 2015 was in line with historical patterns. 

Raw Materials 
   
 The primary raw materials we use in our Print segment are paper and ink. We negotiate with leading paper suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of paper grades and formats. In addition, a substantial amount of paper used in our print business is supplied directly by customers. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated financial results. Generally, customers directly absorb the impact of changing prices on customer-supplied paper. For paper that we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our customers. Contractual arrangements and industry practice should support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on customers  demand for printed products. We also resell waste paper and other print-related by-products and may be impacted by changes in prices for these by-products. 
   
 We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies and use a wide variety of ink formulations and colors. Variations in the cost and supply of certain ink formulations used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated financial results. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to try to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our ink requirements, including entering into a long term supply arrangement with a single supplier for a substantial portion of our ink supply. Certain contractual protections exist in our relationship with such supplier, such as price and quality protections and an ability to seek alternative sources of ink if the supplier breaches or is unable to perform certain of its obligations, which are intended to mitigate the risk of ink-related supply disruptions. Except for our long-term supply arrangement regarding ink, we do not consider ourselves to be dependent upon any single vendor as a source of supply for our businesses, and we believe that sufficient alternative sources for the same, similar or alternative products are available. 
 27 

Changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs impact our ink suppliers and manufacturing costs. Crude oil and energy prices continue to be volatile and have fallen significantly over the last two years. Should prices increase, we generally cannot pass on to customers the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs. We do enter into fixed price contracts for a portion of our natural gas purchases to mitigate the impact of changes in energy prices. We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or customer demand and the related impact either will have on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income, Balance Sheets and Cash Flows.   

Goodwill Impairment Assessment  
   
 The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year s annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. 
   
 Management considered trends in these factors when performing its assessment of whether an interim impairment review was required for any reporting unit.  Based on this interim assessment, management concluded that as of September 30, 2016, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit had declined below its carrying value.  Nevertheless, significant changes in economic and market conditions could result in changes to expectations of future final results and key valuation assumptions.  Such changes could result in revisions of management s estimates of the fair value of the Company s reporting units and could result in a material impairment of goodwill in a future interim period or as of October 31, 2016, the Company s next annual measurement date. 

Financial Review 
   
 In the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its Condensed Combined Statements of Income, Balance Sheets, Cash Flows and certain other information.  The Company has not previously operated as an independent, stand-alone company, but rather as a part of RRD.  There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company s business was previously part of a larger organization.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Combined Financial Statements and the related notes.

28 

Combined  
   
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $948.5 million, a decrease of $50.5 million, or 5.1% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net sales decreased due to lower volume in the Office Products segment, price pressures, lower volume in the Europe reporting unit, a $6.7 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and a $4.7 million, or 0.5%, decrease in pass-through paper sales, partially offset by higher supply chain management and fulfillment volume in the book reporting unit. 
   
 Cost of sales decreased $26.1 million, or 3.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 including a $5.8 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  Additionally, cost of sales decreased due to lower volume in the Office Products segment and Europe reporting unit, the impact of lower pass-through paper sales, and the impact of a $6.7 million purchase accounting inventory adjustment in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by higher supply chain management and fulfillment volume. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased from 81.0% to 82.5% year over year primarily due to price pressures in the Print segment. 
   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.4 million to $64.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher pension income, lower selling expense and a $0.3 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased costs related to the separation. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 7.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 6.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due primarily to higher pension income and lower selling expense.  
   
 The Company expects that net incremental costs to operate as an independent public company will be between $7.0 million to $12.0 million in on an annual basis.  These costs include additional personnel, professional fees, public company fees as well as additional administrative costs and executive compensation arrangements. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $3.5 million of such additional costs.   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $3.2 million compared to $25.4 million in the same period in 2015. The three months ended September 30, 2016 included net restructuring charges of $1.8 million for employee termination costs for 11 employees, substantially all of whom were terminated as of or prior to September 30, 2016, related to one facility closure in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations.  The Company recorded lease termination and other restructuring charges of $1.5 million. Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment of ($0.9) million primarily related to buildings, machinery and equipment associated with a facility closing which reflects a change to an impairment charge recorded earlier in 2016.  The Company also recorded other charges of $0.8 million for multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations unrelated to facility closures. 
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $25.4 million. The three months ended September 30, 2015 included net restructuring charges of $14.7 million for employee termination costs for 523 employees, all of whom were terminated as of or prior to September 30, 2016. These charges primarily related to the to the announcement of three facility closures, two in the Print segment and one in the Office Products segment, and the reorganization of certain operations. The Company recorded $7.7 million of net impairment charges primarily related to machinery and equipment and buildings associated with facility closings.  Additionally, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $2.3 million. The Company also recorded other charges of $0.7 million for multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations unrelated to facility closures. 
   
 Depreciation and amortization decreased $7.5 million to $40.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to decreased capital spending in recent years compared to historical levels, partially offset by the acquisitions of Courier and Esselte Corporation ( Esselte ). Depreciation and amortization included $3.9 million and $5.3 million of amortization of other intangible assets related to customer relationships and trade names for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $12.7 million, or 28.7%, to $57.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to lower restructuring, impairment and other charges, partially offset by price pressures primarily in the magazines, catalogs and retail inserts and book reporting units and an unfavorable mix in the book reporting unit. 

29 

Net interest income decreased by $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015. 

The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 32.1% compared to 67.3% in the same period in 2015.     The 2015 effective income tax rate reflected a tax expense of $9.0 million that was recorded due to an unfavorable court decision related to payment of prior year taxes in an international jurisdiction and the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain international net operating loss deferred tax assets.

34 

Office Products   

Net sales for the Office Products segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $397.2 million, a decrease of $34.0 million, or 7.9% compared to 2015, including a $2.5 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Corporate  
   
 The following table summarizes unallocated operating expenses and certain items impacting comparability within the activities presented as Corporate:  

Corporate operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.5 million, compared to $13.3 million during the same period in 2015. The decrease was mostly driven by lower acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by costs related to the separation, the unfavorable impact of a prior year workers  compensation adjustment, increased bad debt expense, and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in pension income. 

Non-GAAP Measures  
   
  The Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures, such as Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, provide useful information about the Company s operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company s financial performance.  The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business.  Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company s core business operating results over different periods of time.  The Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods and restructuring, impairment and other charges, the Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated.  
   
 35 

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring, impairment and other charges-net, spinoff-related tra  nsaction expenses, a pension settlement charge related to the Esselte defined benefit plan, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting inventory adjustments.  A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the following table:

The nine months ended September 30, 2015     included other charges of $21.3 million,   including integration charges of $19.1 million for payments made to certain Courier employees upon the termination of Courier s executive severance plan immediately prior to the acquisition.    The Company recorded $18.2 million of employee termination costs related to the announcement of three facility closures, two in the Print segment and one in the Office Products segment, the closure of another facility in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company also recorded $8.3 million of net impairment charges primarily related to buildings and machinery and equipment associated with facility closings. Additionally, the Company incurred lease termination and other restructuring charges of $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    
   
 Acquisition-related expenses.     Included charges of   $13.7 million related to legal, accounting and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, associated with completed acquisitions.     
   
 Purchase accounting inventory adjustment.    Included a charge of $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of an inventory purchase accounting adjustment for Courier.   

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its shareholders. Operating cash flows and the Company s $400.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) are the Company s primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company s debt obligations, distributions to shareholders that may be approved by the Board of Directors, acquisitions, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth and completion of restructuring programs. 
   
 The following sections describe the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

37 

Cash flows from Operating Activities  
   
 Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company s products.  Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for raw materials, labor, rent, taxes and other operating activities.  Allocations of operating expenses from RRD are also reflected as operating cash inflows or outflows, including those for pension income and current income taxes payable. 
    
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $136.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $156.4 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected the timing of customer and supplier payments and increased costs related to the separation. 

Cash flows from Investing Activities 
   
  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25.4 million compared to $139.6 million for the same period in 2015.  Capital expenditures were $34.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $2.6 million as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in software capital expenditures related to, and in anticipation of the separation.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used for the acquisition of Courier was $111.1 million.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, proceeds from the sale of other assets were $0.8 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2015.  Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, transfers from restricted cash were $8.7 million compared to $0.3 million during the same period in 2015. There was also $1.2 million of cash used for other investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cash flows from Financing Activities 
   
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $150.4 million compared to $48.8 million for the same period in 2015.  On September 30, 2016, the Company issued new debt presented as proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $815.6 million and debt issuance costs of $18.1 million. Net transfers to parent and affiliates were $944.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $22.1 million of net transfers from parent and affiliates for the same period in 2015.  The increase is primarily due to a cash dividend paid to RRD from the proceeds of the Company s debt issuance.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repaid $70.9 million of debt assumed in the acquisition of Courier.  Additionally, there were $3.4 million of debt repayments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

LIQUIDITY 
   
 Historically, RRD provided financing, cash management and other treasury services to the Company.  The Company s cash balances were swept by RRD and the Company received funding from RRD for its operating and investing cash needs.  Substantially all of the cash and cash equivalents recorded on the Condensed Combined Balance Sheets were in international jurisdictions.  Cash transferred to and from RRD was recorded as intercompany payables and receivables which are reflected in the Parent company investment in the accompanying Condensed Combined Financial Statements.  
   
  Deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those foreign subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations.  The Company has also not recognized deferred tax liabilities related to local taxes on certain foreign earnings as foreign earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Certain cash balances of foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. or local country taxes if repatriated to the U.S. In addition, repatriation of some foreign cash balances is further restricted by local laws. Management regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws, or the Company s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.  

38 

Debt Issuances  
   
 On September 30, 2016, the Company issued $450.0 million of 8.75% Senior Secured Notes (the  Senior Notes ) due October 15, 2023.  Interest on the Senior Notes is due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2017.  Net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes ( the Notes Offering ) were distributed to RRD in the form of a dividend.  The Company did not retain any proceeds from the Notes Offering. 
   
 The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture where certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the Senior Notes (the  Guarantors ).  The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors, which are comprised of each of the Company s existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations. The Senior Notes are not guaranteed by the Company s foreign subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries.  The Senior Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a first-priority lien basis by the collateral, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The Indenture governing the Senior Notes contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including limitations on: (1) liens; (2) indebtedness; (3) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (4) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (5) loans and other investments; (6) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (7) restrictions affecting subsidiaries; (8) transactions with affiliates; and (9) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The Senior Notes mature on October 15, 2023. 
   
 On September 30, 2016 the Company entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) which provides for (i) a new senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $375.0 million (the  Term Loan Facility ) and (ii) a new senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the  Revolving Credit Facility, ).  The interest rate per annum applicable to the Term Loan Facility is equal to, at the Company s option, either a base rate plus a margin of 5.00% or LIBOR plus a margin of 6.00%. The LIBOR rate is subject to a  floor  of 1%.  The interest rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility is equal to a base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25%, in either case based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries.  Interest on the Credit Agreement is due at least quarterly commencing on December 31, 2016.  The Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments of $12.5 million for the first eight quarters and $10.6 million for subsequent quarters.  The debt issuance costs and original issue discount are being amortized over the life of the facilities using the effective interest method. The Term Loan Facility will mature on September 30, 2022 and the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 30, 2021. 
   
 The proceeds of any collection or other realization of collateral received in connection with the exercise of remedies and any distribution in respect of collateral in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied first to repay amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility before the lenders under the Term Loan Facility or the holders of the Senior Notes receive such proceeds.  
   
 The Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $50.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 
   
  The Company has used the net proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to fund a cash dividend to RRD in connection with the spin off and to pay fees and expenses related to the spin off from RRD.  The Company intends to use any additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities for general corporate purposes, including the financing of permitted investments. 
   
 There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. 
   
 The Company s debt maturities as of September 30, 2016 are shown in the following table: 

39 

In the event the entire $400.0 million Revolving Credit Facility were utilized, the Company would not have been in violation of the facility s covenants based on its results of operations for the twelve months ended Sep  tember 30, 2016.   Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was reduced by $12.0 million of outstanding letters of credit.  The Company expects to obtain additional letters of credit related to workers  compensation program, which will further redu  ce the availability by approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million.  
 The failure of a financial institution supporting the Credit Agreement would reduce the size of the Company s committed facility unless a replacement institution were added. Currently, the Credit Agreement is supported by fifteen U.S. and international financial institutions.  
 Dividends 
   
 On October 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share payable on December 1, 2016 to LSC Communications shareholders of record on November 16, 2016. 

Acquisition 
   
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company paid $111.1 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of Courier.  The Company financed the cash portion of the Courier acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings. There were no dispositions. 

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK 
   
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable  debt and price risk on its fixed-rate debt. At September 30, 2016, the Company s variable-interest borrowings were $375.0 million , or  approximately 46%,  of the Company s total debt. 
   
 The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates. Using this sensitivity analysis, such changes would not have a material effect on interest income or  expense and cash flows and would change the fair values of fixed-rate debt at September 30, 2016 by approximately $20.7  million. 
   The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in many countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate. To the extent that borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues, expenses or other transactions are not in the local currency of the subsidiary, the Company is exposed to currency risk and may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk.  The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Exhibit 10.9 
 LSC COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  
  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 THIS AGREEMENT  (this  Agreement ) is entered into, effective as of _________________, 2016, between LSC Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) and _____________________ ( Indemnitee ).  
 WHEREAS,  it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors the most capable persons available;  
 WHEREAS,  Indemnitee is a director of the Company;  
 WHEREAS,  both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims currently being asserted against directors of corporations; and  
 WHEREAS,  in recognition of Indemnitee s need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee s continued and effective service to the Company, and in order to induce Indemnitee to provide continued services to the Company as a director, the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement and for the coverage of Indemnitee under the Company s directors  and officers  liability insurance policies.  
 NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the above premises and of Indemnitee s continuing to serve as a director of the Company and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 (iii)   the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than (a) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or acquiring entity), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, at least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving or acquiring entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (b) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person acquires more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

 (f)   Indemnifiable Event  :  Any event or occurrence that takes place either prior to or after the execution of this Agreement, related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director of the Company, or while a director is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or related to anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity, whether or not the basis of the Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director of the Company, or in any other capacity, as described above.  
 (g)   Independent Counsel  :  Means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) the Indemnitee or (iii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification or Expense Advances hereunder, in any matter (other than with respect to matters relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses).  No law firm or lawyer shall qualify to serve as Independent Counsel if that person would, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement.  The Company shall select a law firm or lawyer to serve as Independent Counsel, subject to the consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
 (h)   Proceeding  :  Any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, internal, administrative or investigative that relates to an Indemnifiable Event.  
 (i)   Reviewing Party  :  Reviewing Party shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 3.  
 2.   Agreement to Indemnify  .  
 (a)   General Agreement regarding Indemnification  .  In the event Indemnitee was, is, or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Proceeding by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee from and against Indemnifiable Costs, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but in the case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto); provided that the Company s commitment set forth in this Section 2(a) to indemnify the Indemnitee shall be subject to the limitations and procedural requirements set forth in this Agreement.    
   (b)   Partial Indemnification  .  If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Indemnifiable Costs,   
 3 
 
  but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to   which Indemnitee is entitled.  
 (c)   Advancement of Expenses  .  If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee (an  Expense Advance  or an  Advance ) within 21 calendar days after the receipt by the Company of a request from Indemnitee for an Advance, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding; provided that the Company shall not advance any expenses to Indemnitee unless and until it shall have received a request and  undertaking substantially in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A  .  Any request for an Expense Advance shall be accompanied by an itemization, in reasonable detail, of the Expenses for which advancement is sought; provided however that Indemnitee need not submit to the Company any information that counsel for Indemnitee deems is privileged and exempt from compulsory disclosure in any proceeding.  Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses.  If Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, as provided in Section 4, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or have lapsed). Indemnitee s obligation to reimburse the Company for Expense Advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.    
 (d)   Exception to Obligation to Indemnify and Advance Expenses  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless (i) the Company has joined in or the Board has consented to the initiation of such Proceeding; or (ii) the Proceeding is one to enforce indemnification rights under Section 5.  
 3.   Reviewing Party  .  
 (a)   Definition of Reviewing Party  . Other than as contemplated by Section 3(b), the person, persons or entity  who shall determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in the first instance ( the Reviewing Party ) shall be (i) the Board of Directors of the Company acting by a majority vote of a quorum of Disinterested Directors or (ii) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written determination to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.  
   (b)   Reviewing Party Following Change in Control  . After a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors), the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Counsel.  With respect to all matters arising from such a Change in Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or   
 4 
 
  hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for I  ndemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from the Independent Counsel.    Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee should be permit  ted to be indemnified under applicable law.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Counsel and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys  fees), claims, liabilities, loss, and damages arisi  ng out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of Independent Counsel pursuant hereto.  
 4.   Indemnification Process and Appeal.  
 (a)   Indemnification Payment  .     
 (i)   The determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall, to the extent practicable, be made by the Reviewing Party not later than 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of a written demand on the Company for indemnification (which written demand shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification).  The Reviewing Party making the determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification shall notify Indemnitee of such written determination no later than two business days thereafter.    
 (ii)   Unless the Reviewing Party has provided a written determination to the Company that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law, Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs, and shall receive payment thereof, from the Company in accordance with this Agreement within 10 business days after the Reviewing Party has made its determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification.   
 (b)   Suit to Enforce Rights  .  If (i) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made within the time limitation for such a determination set forth in Section 4(a)(i), (ii) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) is not made within the period permitted for such payment by such section, (iii) the Reviewing Party determines pursuant to Section 4(a) that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) Indemnitee has not received advancement of Expenses within the time period permitted for such advancement by Section 2(c), then Indemnitee shall have the right to enforce the indemnification and advancement rights granted under this Agreement by commencing litigation in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof.  The Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding.  Any determination by the Reviewing Party not challenged by the Indemnitee within six months of the date of the Reviewing Party s determination shall be binding on the Company and Indemnitee.  The remedy provided for in this Section 4 shall be in addition to any other remedies available to Indemnitee in law or equity.  
 (c)   Defense to Indemnification, Burden of Proof, and Presumptions  .  
 5 
 
    (i)    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification   (or payment of Expense Advances) hereunder, the Reviewing Party shall presume that an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (or payment of Expense Advances) under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumpti  on in connection with the making by the Reviewing Party of any determination contrary to that presumption.  
 (ii)   It shall be a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee against the Company to enforce this Agreement that it is not permissible under applicable law for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed.  
 (iii)   For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval and whether with or without an admission of liability on the part of the Indemnitee), conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  
 (iv)     For purposes of any determination under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Company in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or on information or records given or reports made to the Company by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Company. The provisions of this Section 4(c)(iv) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.  
 (v)   The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Company shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.  
 5.   Indemnification for Expenses Incurred in Enforcing Rights  .    The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law and, if requested by Indemnitee pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2(c), shall advance such Expenses to Indemnitee, that are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by Indemnitee for:  
 (i)   enforcement of this Agreement;  
   (ii)   indemnification of Indemnifiable Costs or Expense Advances by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or under applicable law or the   
 6 
 
  Company s Restated   Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws now or hereafter in effect relating to indemnification for Indemnifiable Events; and/or  
 (iii)   recovery under directors  and officers  liability insurance policies maintained by the Company.  
 6.   Notification and Defense of Proceeding.  
 (a)   Notice  .  Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement thereof.  The failure to notify or promptly notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement, and shall not relieve the Company from liability hereunder except to the extent the Company has been prejudiced or as further provided in Section 6(c).  
 (b)   Defense  .  With respect to any Proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense and except as otherwise provided below, to the extent the Company so wishes, it may assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Company.  After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any Proceeding, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such Proceeding, but all Expenses related thereto incurred after notice from the Company of its assumption of the defense shall be at Indemnitee s expense unless: (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee has reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest between Indemnitee and the Company in the defense of the Proceeding, (iii) after a Change in Control, the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been approved by the Independent Counsel, or (iv) the Company shall not within 60 calendar days in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which case all Expenses of the Proceeding shall be borne by the Company.  If the Company has selected counsel to represent Indemnitee and other current and former directors, officers or employees of the Company in the defense of a Proceeding, and a majority of such persons, including Indemnitee, reasonably object to such counsel selected by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of this   Section 6(b)  , then such persons, including Indemnitee, shall be permitted to employ one additional counsel of their choice and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company;   provided  ,   however  , that such counsel shall be chosen from amongst the list of counsel, if any, approved by any company with which the Company obtains or maintains insurance.  In the event separate counsel is retained by a group of persons including Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 6(b), the Company shall cooperate with such counsel with respect to the defense of the Proceeding, including making documents, witnesses and other reasonable information related to the defense available to such separate counsel pursuant to joint-defense agreements or confidentiality agreements, as appropriate.  The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which Indemnitee shall have made the determination provided for in (ii) above.  
 7 
 
    (c)    Settlement of Claims  .    The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any amounts paid in settlement of any   Proceeding effected without the Company s written consent.  The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee s written consent.  Neither the Company nor the Indemnitee w  ill unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.  The Company shall not be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement with regard to any judicial award if the Company was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity, at its   expense, to participate in the defense of such action; the Company s liability hereunder shall not be excused if participation in the Proceeding by the Company was barred by this Agreement.  
 7.   Non-Exclusivity  .    The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the laws of the State of Delaware, the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in applicable law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law, or this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties that Indemnitee enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  
 8.   Liability Insurance  .    To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors  or officers  liability insurance, Indemnitee, if a director of the Company, shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms.  
 9.   Amendment of this Agreement  .    No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  Except as specifically provided herein, no failure to exercise or any delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver thereof.  
 10.   Subrogation  .    In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  
 11.   No Duplication of Payments  .    The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (whether under the Company s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s Amended and Restated By-laws, any insurance policy, by law, or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.  
   12.   Binding Effect  .    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and   
 8 
 
  legal representatives.  The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or as  sets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such successio  n had taken place.  This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company s request.  
 13.   Severability  .    If any provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, void, or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, void, or unenforceable.  
 14.   Governing Law  .    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.  
 15.   Entire Agreement.    Subject to Section 7 hereof, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written, and implied, including the Prior Agreement, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.    
 16.   Notices  .    All notices, demands, and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand, against receipt, or mailed, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and addressed
