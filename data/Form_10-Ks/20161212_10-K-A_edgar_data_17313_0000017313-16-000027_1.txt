Pursuant to Rule 3-09(b), this Amendment includes the separate audited financial statements for our unconsolidated portfolio company, Media Recovery, Inc., which were not included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K because Media Recovery, Inc. s fiscal year ended later than the Company s fiscal year.

Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original 10-K and our filings with the SEC made subsequent to the filing of the Original 10-K on June 14, 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS   

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  Media Recovery, Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Media Recovery, Inc. (the  Company ) which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders  equity, and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

Management s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ); this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances, but  not for  the purpose of  expressing an opinion  on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 in conformity with GAAP. 

Emphasis of Matter 

Goodwill 

As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for goodwill in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, due to unwinding the effects of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-02,   Accounting for Goodwill  ,    a Consensus of the Private Company Council   as the Company meets the definition of a public business entity. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Redeemable Preferred Stock 

As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its classification for its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, as the Company meets the definition of a public business entity and is no longer eligible for certain nonpublic company exceptions under Accounting Standards Codification 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  . Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries ShockWatch, Inc.; MRI DPC; DataSpan, Inc.; Shocklog Holdings Limited; and ShockWatch Europe, B.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. MRI DPC and DataSpan were sold during 2014 and classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, see Note L. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

All assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. All revenues and expenses in the statement of operations, of these foreign subsidiaries, are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income but are shown in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no such investments. The Company maintains deposits primarily in one financial institution, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance provided by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Company has not experienced any losses related to amounts in excess of FDIC limits.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are stated at amounts management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Company s customer base, and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. One customer s accounts receivable balance consisted of approximately 12% and 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is principally determined by the weighted-average cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Inventories include factory overhead that is applied on the basis of labor costs and manufacturing expenses incurred, less allowances for obsolete items. The Company determines that items are slow moving or obsolete based on whether they have been sold or used in production between 180 and 365 days, or greater than 365 days, respectively, during the fiscal year. Such items are then specifically reviewed for obsolescence based on other criteria which include the frequency that these items are purchased, manufactured, and sold. The amount of the inventory reserve for each year presented is disclosed in Note D. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the assets  estimated service lives. For major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred, and betterments are capitalized. The cost of assets sold or abandoned and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss of the respective period. The estimated useful lives for buildings and improvements range from 10 to 39 years and for machinery and equipment range from 3 to 7 years. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable. The Company continually evaluates its customers  financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Company s customer base. Additionally, credit losses have historically been within management s expectations. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales upon the passage of title, which generally occurs upon shipment, or the rendering of services, and when collectability is deemed probable. 

Presentation of Sales Tax 

The states in which the Company operates and the counties within those states impose a sales tax on all of the Company s sales to nonexempt customers. The Company collects that sales tax from customers and remits the entire amount to the applicable state. The Company s accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted to the states from revenue and cost of sales.

Shipping and Handling Costs 

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 

Advertising 

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.  Total advertising costs for the years ended September 30 2016, 2015, and 2014, were approximately $100, $400, and $21,000, respectively. 

Stock Awards 

The Company may, with the approval of its Board of Directors, grant stock awards for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model for use in estimating the fair value of stock awards. 

Reclassification 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations. 

Goodwill 

In January 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-02 related to the accounting for goodwill by private companies. Under this guidance, private companies may elect to amortize goodwill over 10 years, or less than 10 years if the entity can demonstrate that another useful life is more appropriate, and to test goodwill for impairment only upon occurrence of a triggering event that indicates that the book value of the entity may exceed the fair value of the entity, as opposed to testing goodwill for impairment annually under prior accounting guidance. The accounting guidance was originally adopted by the Company for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, however, these consolidated financial statements were revised as the Company now meets the definition of a public business entity and is precluded from adopting ASU 2014-02. 

The Company records goodwill when consideration paid in an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company conducted their annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. They have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under GAAP. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is performed.  The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No impairment of goodwill was required at September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014. 

Long-lived Assets 

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets including goodwill, property, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which

Table of Contents  

MEDIA RECOVERY, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value and is recorded in the period the determination was made. Based upon management s assessment, there was no impairment of long- lived assets at September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations of the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-17 in November of 2015.  The Company has early adopted this guidance for the year ended September 30, 2016. ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance sheet. The new standard requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be netted together and classified as noncurrent. 

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material  effect on  the  financial statements  or  the effective tax  rate for the  year  ended September 30, 2016, or during the prior three years. The Company and its subsidiaries are currently subject to a three-year statute of limitations by major tax jurisdictions. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. The estimated fair value of accounts receivable (trade and other), accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate the carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the line of credit also approximates fair value since the instrument bears market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes. 

C.  Fair Value Measurements 

GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a three-tier hierarchy that is used to identify assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The hierarchy focuses on the inputs used to measure fair value and requires that the lowest level input be used. The three levels defined are as follows: 

Level 1   observable inputs that are based upon quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities within active markets.     

Level 2   observable inputs other than Level 1 that are based upon quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, based upon quoted prices within inactive markets, or inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable through market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.     

Level 3   inputs that are unobservable for the particular asset or liability due to little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. These inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the particular asset or liability.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

The Company holds no instruments which have fair value measured at Level 1 or Level 2. The Company s stock awards and goodwill were valued using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy contained in ASC 820-10, in accordance with policies disclosed in Note B, and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

There were no changes to fair value for the Company s Goodwill using Level 3 inputs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

D.  Inventories 

Inventories consist of the following as of September 30: 

E.  Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment consisted of the following at September 30: 

F.  Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock 

In fiscal year 1998 the Company issued 5,850,000 shares of Series A preferred stock which are convertible into shares of voting common stock at the option of the holder at any time at the initial conversion price of $1.00 per share, resulting in an initial conversion rate of one fully paid and non-assessable share of voting common stock for each share of Series A preferred stock, subject to adjustment. During the year ended September 30, 2006, 5,050,000 preferred shares were converted to common shares. No preferred shares were converted to common shares during the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Dividends are paid to holders of preferred stock concurrently with dividends paid to holders of common stock and such dividends do not accumulate.  In addition, at any time on or after December 31, 2004, holders of preferred stock representing in the aggregate at least 10% of the then outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock may

Table of Contents  

MEDIA RECOVERY, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

require the Company to redeem such stock for $1.00 per share. The Company has classified the Series A Preferred Stock as temporary equity in accordance with ASC Topic No. 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  , which states that certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments should be classified as temporary equity. 

The Series A preferred stock has a $0.01 par value and a $1 liquidation preference. The Series A preferred stock could be redeemed through a cash payment if requested by the stockholders. Holders of preferred stock are not allowed to vote on matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. However, certain corporate matters including dividend payments, issuances of certain stock awards, disposal of shares of capital stock, and a merger of the Company, require the consent of the holders of at least 85% of the then outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock. The Company has reserved 800,000 shares of common stock for the potential conversion of preferred stock. When the Company did not meet the definition of a public business entity it was eligible for certain nonpublic company exceptions under Accounting Standards Codification 480,   Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  , and classified these redeemable preferred shares as equity. 

G.  Stockholders  Equity  

Stock Awards 

During October of 2010 the Company canceled all 160,260 phantom stock awards previously outstanding and granted 215,260 new phantom stock awards to key management employees. The 2010 phantom stock awards vested at the expiration of a 63 month period (December 31, 2014). The awards were not exercisable until the end of the period (December 31, 2014), and were to be automatically exercised by the Company between February 1, 2015 and February 28, 2015, entitling the employees to a cash payment at an amount equal to the excess of the value of a share of the Company s stock (as determined by the Board of Directors of a corporation that is the major stockholder of the Company) over the phantom award  exercise price  of $2.46 per share. The Company recorded compensation expense for valuing its phantom stock awards based on the Company s assessment of its enterprise value at each fiscal year end. In assessing such value, the Company considered its financial condition and operating results; the long-term potential of its business; the market for and recent sales prices of the Company s securities, if any; and the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses. Two of the key management employees left the Company and forfeited 65,000 of the 2010 phantom stock awards. 

During 2015 all remaining phantom stock awards were forfeited or expired. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded approximately $0, ($441,000), and $257,000, respectively, in compensation expense (benefit) associated with the issuance of forfeitures of phantom stock awards. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no phantom stock award liability. 

Option Grants 

During 2016 certain officers of the Company were granted options to purchase common shares of the Company. Option transactions for the year ended September 31, 2016, are as follows: 

12 

Table of Contents  

MEDIA RECOVERY, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

As of September 30, 2016, the range of exercise prices for outstanding options was $5.15 to $5.76. 

All stock-based compensation must be recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements and such cost should be measured at the fair value of the award. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company determined the initial expected life based on a simplified method, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules, and pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeitures. 

The fair value of options granted for the year ended September 30, 2016, was estimated to be 

$550,262 at the date  of grant using a  Black-Scholes option-pricing  model using the  following weighted average assumptions at the date of grant: 

Risk-free interest rate  

1.63% 

Expected option life  

6.5 years  

Expected stock volatility  

23.61% 

Expected dividend yields  

-  

The expected stock volatility was calculated by averaging the historical volatility of a comparable public entity. As of September 30, 2016, all options were outstanding. 

During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $112,932 of stock-based compensation related to the awards, which is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Total unamortized stock-based compensation expense at September 30, 2016, was $437,330 and will be expensed ratably through 2021. There was no stock-based compensation expense or unamortized expense as of or for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. 

H.    Line of Credit  

The Company maintains a financing arrangement with a bank. The line of credit requires compliance with certain financial covenants and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. Outstanding amounts bear interest at the prime or LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (2.25% at September 30, 2016). The Company had no debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. There was approximately $2,755,000 outstanding under this line of credit at September 30, 2014, which was paid off in 2015. The line of credit matured in 2016 but was extended until March 19, 2017. 

I.    Income Taxes  

Significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:

Table of Contents  

MEDIA RECOVERY, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (continued) 

The difference between income tax expense and tax expense computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to income before taxes is due primarily to the effect of nondeductible goodwill impairment, applicable state income taxes, foreign tax credits, and nondeductible meals and entertainment expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities for the years ended September 30, consisted of the following: 

J.    Employee Benefit Plan  

The Company has a 401(k) deferred compensation plan for all eligible employees. Active participants may contribute up to 90% of their annual compensation, subject to annual limit established by the government. The Company matches 50% of the employees  contributions up to 6% of the employees  salaries. Effective November 30, 2015, the Plan merged into the Capital Southwest Management Corporation Employee Savings Plan. For the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recognized approximately $111,000, $128,000, and $284,000, respectively, of expense related to this Plan. 

K.    Commitments and Contingencies   

Operating Leases 

The Company leases operating facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Lease agreements expire at various dates through 2021. Associated rent expense for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, was approximately $128,000, $148,000, and $308,000, respectively. As a result of escalating lease payments, the Company has recorded deferred rent of approximately $124,000 and $148,000 as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial terms of one year or more consisted of the following at September 30, 2016:

Litigation 

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of operations. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no known material legal contingencies. 

L.    Discontinued Operations  

On October 14, 2013, the Company sold substantially all the assets of MRI DPC, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $6.3 million, which included a working capital price adjustment of approximately $207,000. 

On September 30, 2014, the Company sold substantially all the assets of DataSpan, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $8.7 million, which included a working capital price adjustment of approximately $2.3 million. The Company incurred a net loss of $119,310 and $730,875 on the sale of the entity for 2015. No gain or loss was recorded in 2016. 

The operations of both entities net of applicable income taxes, are presented as discontinued operations and comprehensive income for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  Interest expense was not allocated to the reporting unit and, therefore, all of the Company s interest expense is included in continuing operations. 

M.    Subsequent Events  

Management has evaluated and considered disclosure of subsequent events up to and including December 6, 2016, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available for issuance.
