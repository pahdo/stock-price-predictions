to Financial Statements  

1.
Organization and Description of Business   

Pinkbrick
Holdings Inc. (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination.  

Going
Concern    

These
financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis because the stockholders have undertaken to provide continuing financial
support so that the Company is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.  

2.
Significant Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Cash  

Cash
includes funds held in the Company s bank accounts.  

Uninsured
Cash Balances   

Cumulative
balances in excess of $250,000 for 2016 per institution are not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company. At August 31,
2016 the interest bearing deposits which exceeded the federal depository coverage were approximately $0.  

Preferred
and Common Stock   

The
Preferred Stock of the corporation may be issued by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in one or more classes or one or
more series within any class and such classes or series shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine, from time
to time. Holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all stockholders meetings
for all purposes, including the election of directors.  

Income
taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities
be computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus
the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

The
Company has no unrecognized tax benefits at August 31, 2016.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This
section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q   contain   forward-looking   statements,
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not
directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as  future, 
 anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   intends,   plans, 
 predicts,   will,   would,   could,   can,   may,  and
similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company s actual results may
differ significantly from the results discussed in the   forward-looking   statements. The following discussion of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes
thereto, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,
months or periods refer to the Company s fiscal years ended in November and the associated quarters, months and periods
of those fiscal years. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue
into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future.
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.   

Business
Overview; Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months   

Pinkbrick
Holdings, Inc. ( we,   us,   our  or the  Company ) was organized as a vehicle
to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time is to achieve long-term
growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential
candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury, if any, or with additional money contributed
by our management, stockholders or another source. The Company, based on current business activities, is a  blank check 
company. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines those companies as  any development stage company that is issuing
a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ),
and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company
or companies.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of  blank
check  companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a  shell company,  defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does
not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully
concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for
so long as we are subject to those requirements.  

During
the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating
a business combination. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts,
as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  

We
may consider a business combination with a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of
additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established
business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative,
a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital,
but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant
expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  

Our
management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject
to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable or early stage or potential emerging growth
companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  

Our
management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing,
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.  

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital that we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly
traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of, and investors
in, a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative audited financial statements, footnotes
and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.  

Three
and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended August 31, 2015   

We
have not earned any revenues since our inception in November 2014. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we
are able to enter into a business combination.  

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $10,140 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared with $9,008 for the
three months ended August 31, 2015. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $21,268 for the nine months ended August 31,
2016, compared with $28,869 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. The entire amount for both periods was attributable to
general and administrative expenses, principally costs associated with Exchange Act filings.  

We
incurred a net loss of $10,140 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared with $9,008 for the three months
ended August 31, 2015. We incurred a net loss of $21,268 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared to a net
operating loss of $28,869 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of August 31, 2016, we had $0 in current assets, $27,000 in liabilities and $(27,000) in working capital. We currently do not
engage, nor do we intend to engage, in any business activities that provide cash flow until we enter into a successful business
combination.  

In
its March 1, 2016 report, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
expect that our management and the Company, through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities, will locate a business
combination target. We expect that funds in the amount of approximately $30,000 will be required in order for the Company to satisfy
its Exchange Act reporting requirements during the next 12 months, in addition to any other funds that will be required in order
to complete a business combination. Such funds can only be estimated upon identifying a business combination target. Our management
and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds on behalf of the Company as needed in order to accomplish its business
plan and comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements, however, there are no agreements in effect between the Company and
our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds to the Company. Therefore, there are no assurances
that the Company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to consummate a business combination transaction  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of August 31, 2016, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under
this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of August, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer
and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. This was due to our status as a shell company
and our limited resources, including the absence of a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CERTIFICATIONS   

I,
