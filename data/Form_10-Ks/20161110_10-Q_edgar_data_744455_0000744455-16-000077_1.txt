1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Organization 
    
  Great-West Life   Annuity Insurance Company ( GWLA ) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of GWL A Financial Inc. ( GWL A Financial ), a holding company.  GWL A Financial is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco U.S. Inc. ( Lifeco U.S. ) and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco Inc. ( Lifeco ), a Canadian holding company.  The Company offers a wide range of life insurance, retirement, and investment products to individuals, businesses, and other private and public organizations throughout the United States.  The Company is an insurance company domiciled in the State of Colorado and is subject to regulation by the Colorado Division of Insurance. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the accounts of its subsidiaries over which it exercises control and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , which was derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q.  In compliance with those instructions, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  As such, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the Company s condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows as of   September 30, 2016  , and for all periods presented. The condensed consolidated results of operations and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results or cash flows expected for the full year. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

2.  Acquisitions 
    
  Putnam Retirement Business 
    
  Description of transaction 
    
  On January 1, 2015, the Company acquired the retirement business of Putnam Investments, LLC ( Putnam ), an affiliate of the Company.  The transaction was accounted for as a combination between entities under common control.  As such, the assets and liabilities acquired from Putnam were recorded at historical cost as of January 1, 2015.  In exchange for cash paid in the amount of   $4,114  , the Company acquired   $11,501   of other assets, assumed   $7,717   of other liabilities, and recognized a dividend of   $330  .

3.  Application of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  .  The update primarily amends the criteria used to evaluate whether certain variable interest entities ( VIEs ) should be consolidated.  The update also modifies the criteria used to determine whether partnerships and similar entities are VIEs.  The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, including in the interim periods.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations; however, the Company has additional investments that meet the definition of VIE under this update.  As such, the guidance was retrospectively applied and the December 31, 2015 carrying value and maximum exposure to loss in relation to the activities of the VIEs disclosed in Note 5 includes an additional   $35,776   to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  .  The update requires the Company to determine if the cloud computing arrangement contains a software license and if so, apply the accounting requirements for other intangible assets.  The update also supersedes the requirement to apply lease accounting requirements by analogy for lease classification.  If the arrangement is not a software license, then the Company applies accounting requirements for a service requirement.  The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)   ( ASU 2015-07 ).  The update required assets being valued using net asset value ( NAV ) as a practical expedient to be excluded from the fair value hierarchy table.  The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations; however, the Company has investments in separate accounts for which fair value is estimated using NAV as a practical expedient.  As such, for the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has retroactively applied this guidance as required by the ASU and removed   $533,961   from the December 31, 2015, Level 2 investments in separate accounts in the fair value hierarchy table in Note 8 to conform to current period presentation.   
    
  Future adoption of new accounting pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ).  The update outlines a comprehensive accounting model for revenue arising from customer contracts and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  While the update does not apply to insurance contracts within the scope of Topic 944, it does apply to other fee income earned by the Company which includes fees from assets under management, assets under administration, shareholder servicing, administration and record-keeping services, and investment advisory services.  The core principle of the model requires that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.  The update also requires increased disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.  The FASB has also issued several updates to ASU 2014-09 including ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations   (improving the     operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations), ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   (reducing the     cost and complexity of applying the guidance on identifying promised goods or services and to improve the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance), and ASU 2016-12  , Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   (amending the guidance on collectability, non cash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition).  In adopting ASU 2014-09, the Company may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.  The update is effective for public business entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of accounting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Financial Services-Insurance: Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  .  The update requires that all years in the claims development table that precede the current reporting period and the related disclosure  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  
  GREAT-WEST LIFE   ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Dollars in Thousands) 
  (Unaudited) 

about the history of claims duration should be presented as required supplementary information.  The update also includes a disclosure objective of providing information about claim frequency along with a description of methodologies for determining claim frequency information, unless it is impracticable to do so.  The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments by requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, use of exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets (i.e. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements, eliminating the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of a financial instrument measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, requiring entities to present separately in other comprehensive income the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (i.e.  own credit ) when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, and clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  The update is     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The ASU also permits early adoption of the own credit provision.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  .  This update requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and also disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivative Contract Novations  .  The amendments clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument or a change in critical term of the hedging relationship.  The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures  .  The amendments simplify the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.  The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Account  .  The amendments simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, and cash flow statements.  The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13  , Financial Instruments: Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  The standard amends guidance on the impairment of financial instruments by adding an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses and is intended to result in more timely recognition of losses.  The standard also simplifies the accounting by decreasing the number of credit impairment models that an entity can use to account for debt instruments.  The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those beginning after

December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  .  The standard amends the guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitized transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 

4.  Dividends 
    
  The maximum amount of dividends, which can be paid to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled in the State of Colorado, is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and statutory net gain from operations.  Prior to the payment of any dividends, the Company seeks approval from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the Company paid dividends of   $125,691   and   $139,711  , respectively, to its parent, GWL A Financial. 

5.  Summary of Investments 
    
  The following tables summarize fixed maturity investments classified as available-for-sale and the non-credit-related component of other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ):  

(1)     Indicates the amount of any OTTI (gain) loss included in AOCI that is included in gross unrealized gains and losses.  OTTI (gain) loss included in AOCI, as presented above, includes both the initial recognition of non-credit losses and the effects of subsequent increases and decreases in estimated fair value for those fixed maturity securities with previous non-credit impairment. The non-credit loss component of OTTI (gain) loss was in an unrealized gain position due to increases in estimated fair value subsequent to initial recognition of non-credit losses on such securities. 
   (2)    Includes perpetual debt investments with amortized cost of   $135,187   and estimated fair value of   $111,978  .

   (2)    Includes perpetual debt investments with amortized cost of   $149,062   and estimated fair value of   $116,423  . 
    
  See Note 8 for additional discussion regarding fair value measurements. 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity investments classified as available-for-sale, based on estimated cash flows, are shown in the table below.  Actual maturities will likely differ from these projections because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  

Mortgage-backed (commercial and residential) and asset-backed securities include those issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies.

Fixed maturity investments     Total unrealized losses and OTTI decreased by   $216,739  , or   60%  , from   December 31, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  .  The majority, or   $200,024  , of the decrease was in the less than twelve months category.  The overall decrease in unrealized losses was across all asset classes and reflects lower interest rates at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  , resulting in generally higher valuations of these fixed maturity securities. 
    
  Total unrealized losses greater than twelve months decreased by   $16,715   from   December 31, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  .  Corporate debt securities account for   92%  , or   $102,659  , of the unrealized losses and OTTI greater than twelve months at   September 30, 2016  .  Non-investment grade corporate debt securities account for   $13,441   of the unrealized losses and OTTI greater than twelve months, and   $7,572   of the losses are on perpetual debt investments issued by investment grade rated banks in the United Kingdom.  Management does not have the intent to sell these assets; therefore, an OTTI was not recognized in earnings. 
    
  Asset-backed securities account for   7%   of the unrealized losses and OTTI greater than twelve months at   September 30, 2016  .  The present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is not less than amortized cost and management does not have the intent to sell these assets; therefore, an OTTI was not recognized in earnings.

Other-than-temporary impairment recognition     The OTTI on fixed maturity securities where the loss portion is bifurcated  and the credit related component is recognized in realized investment gains (losses) is summarized as follows: 

6.  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Derivative transactions are generally entered into pursuant to International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) Master Agreements or Master Securities Forward Transaction Agreements ( MSFTA ) with approved counterparties that provide for a single net payment to be made by one party to the other on a daily basis, periodic payment dates, or at the due date, expiration, or termination of the agreement. 
    
  The ISDA Master Agreements contain provisions that would allow the counterparties to require immediate settlement of all derivative instruments in a net liability position if the Company were to default on any debt obligations over a certain threshold.  The MSFTA contain provisions which do not stipulate a threshold for default and only apply to debt obligations between the Company and the specific counterparty.  The aggregate fair value, inclusive of accrued income and expense, of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was   $69,984   and   $76,107   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company had pledged collateral related to these derivatives of   $28,526   and   $45,940   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in the normal course of business.  If the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered on   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of assets that could be required to settle the derivatives in a net liability position was   $41,458  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had pledged   $28,526   and   $50,924   of unrestricted cash collateral to counterparties in the normal course of business, while other counterparties had pledged   $80,630   and   $19,060   of unrestricted cash collateral to the Company to satisfy collateral netting agreements, respectively. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated   $7,972   of net derivative gains related to cash flow hedges included in AOCI will be reclassified into net income within the next twelve months.  Gains and losses included in AOCI are reclassified into net income when the hedged item affects earnings. 
    
  Types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies 
    
  Interest rate contracts 
    
  Cash flow hedges 
    
  Interest rate swap agreements are used to convert the interest rate on certain debt security investments and debt obligations from a floating rate to a fixed rate.  Interest rate futures are used to manage the interest rate risks of forecasted acquisitions of fixed rate maturity investments and are primarily structured to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain liabilities.

Fair value hedges 
    
  Interest rate swap agreements are used to convert the interest rate on certain debt securities from a fixed rate to a floating rate to manage the interest rate risk of the change in the fair value of certain fixed rate maturity investments. 
    
  Not designated as hedging instruments 
    
  The Company enters into certain transactions in which derivatives are hedging an economic risk but hedge accounting is not elected.  These derivative instruments include:  exchange-traded interest rate swap futures, over-the-counter ( OTC ) interest rate swaptions, OTC interest rate swaps, exchange-traded Eurodollar interest rate futures, and treasury interest rate futures.  Certain of the Company s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through a central clearing counterparty while others are bilateral contracts between the Company and a counterparty. 
    
  The derivative instruments mentioned above are economic hedges and used to manage risk.  These transactions are used to offset changes in liabilities including those in variable annuity products, hedge the economic effect of a large increase in interest rates, manage the potential variability in future interest payments due to a change in credited interest rates and the related change in cash flows due to increased surrenders, and manage interest rate risks of forecasted acquisitions of fixed rate maturity investments and forecasted liability pricing. 
    
  Cross-currency contracts 
    
  Cross-currency swaps are used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments denominated in other than U.S. dollars.  The Company uses cross-currency swaps to convert interest and principal payments on foreign denominated debt instruments into U.S. dollars.  Cross-currency swaps may be designated as cash flow hedges; however, hedge accounting is not always elected. 
    
  Equity contracts 
    
  The Company uses futures on equity indices to offset changes in guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit liabilities; however, hedge accounting is not elected.  
    
  Other forward contracts 
    
  The Company uses forward settling to be announced ( TBA ) securities to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of agency mortgage-backed securities (pass-throughs). These transactions enhance the return on the Company s investment portfolio and provide a more liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than purchasing or selling individual agency mortgage-backed pools.  As the Company does not regularly accept delivery of such securities, they are accounted for as derivatives but hedge accounting is not elected.

7.  Summary of Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company enters into derivative transactions and short-term reverse repurchase agreements with several approved counterparties. The Company s derivative transactions are generally governed by MSFTA or ISDA Master Agreements which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting in the event of default or bankruptcy of the Company s counterparties.  The Company s MSFTA and ISDA Master Agreements generally include provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its derivative transactions. These provisions have the effect of securing each party s position to the extent of collateral held.  Short-term reverse repurchase agreements also include collateral provisions with the counterparty.  The following tables summarize the effect of master netting arrangements on the Company s financial position in the normal course of business and in the event of default or bankruptcy of the Company s counterparties:

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows: 
    
  Fixed maturity investments 
    
  The fair values for fixed maturity investments are generally based upon market prices from independent pricing services.  In cases where market prices are not readily available, fair values are estimated by the Company.  To determine estimated fair value for these instruments, the Company generally utilizes discounted cash flows models with market observable pricing inputs such as spreads, average life, and credit quality.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. 
    
  Short-term investments and securities lending agreements 
    
  The amortized cost of short-term investments, collateral under securities lending agreements, and payable under securities lending agreements is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their short-term nature and high credit quality of the issuers. 
    
  Collateral under derivative counterparty collateral agreements 
    
  Included in other assets is cash collateral received from or pledged to derivative counterparties and included in other liabilities is the obligation to return the cash collateral to the counterparties.  The carrying value of the collateral is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Derivative instruments 
    
  Included in other assets and other liabilities are derivative financial instruments. The estimated fair values of OTC derivatives, primarily consisting of cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, and other forward contracts, are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the end of each reporting period, taking into consideration current interest rates and other relevant factors. 
    
  Embedded derivative - GLWB 
    
  Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of GLWB include long-term equity and interest rate implied volatility, mortality, and policyholder behavior assumptions, such as benefit utilization, lapses, and partial withdrawals. 
    
  Separate account assets and liabilities 
    
  Separate account assets and liabilities primarily include investments in mutual fund, fixed maturity, and short-term securities.  Mutual funds are recorded at net asset value, which approximates fair value, on a daily basis.  The fixed maturity and short-term investments are valued in the same manner, and using the same pricing sources and inputs as the fixed maturity and short-term investments of the Company.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:  
    
  Mortgage loans on real estate 
    
  Mortgage loan fair value estimates are generally based on discounted cash flows.  A discount rate matrix is used where the discount rate valuing a specific mortgage generally corresponds to that mortgage s remaining term and credit quality.  Management believes the discount rate used is comparable to the credit, interest rate, term, servicing costs, and risks of loans similar to the portfolio loans that the Company would make today given its internal pricing strategy.  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Policy loans 
    
  Policy loans are funds provided to policy holders in return for a claim on the policy. The funds provided are limited to the cash surrender value of the underlying policy. The nature of policy loans is to have a negligible default risk as the loans are fully collateralized by the value of the policy. Policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid either by the policyholder or with proceeds from the policy. Due to the collateralized nature of policy loans and unpredictable timing of repayments, the Company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates carrying value. The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Limited partnership interests 
    
  Limited partnership interests, accounted for using the cost method, represent the Company s minority ownership interests in pooled investment funds.  These funds employ varying investment strategies that primarily make private equity investments across diverse industries and geographical focuses.  The estimated fair value was determined using the partnership financial statement reported capital account or net asset value adjusted for other relevant information which may impact the exit value of the investments.  Distributions by these investments are generated from investment gains, from operating income generated by the underlying investments of the funds, and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds which are estimated to be liquidated over the next   one   to   10 years  .  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 3. 
    
  Other investments 
    
  Other investments primarily include real estate held for investment.  The estimated fair value for real estate is based on the unadjusted appraised value which includes factors such as comparable property sales, property income analysis, and capitalization rates.  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 3. 
    
  Annuity contract benefits without life contingencies 
    
  The estimated fair value of annuity contract benefits without life contingencies is estimated by discounting the projected expected cash flows to the maturity of the contracts utilizing risk-free spot interest rates plus a provision for the Company s credit risk.  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Policyholders  funds 
    
  The carrying amount of policyholders  funds approximates the fair value since the Company can change the interest credited rates with   30 days   notice. The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Commercial paper 
    
  The amortized cost of commercial paper is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to its short-term nature and the high credit quality of the obligor.  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2.

Notes payable 
    
  The estimated fair value of the notes payable to GWL A Financial is based upon quoted market prices from independent pricing services of securities with characteristics similar to those of the notes payable.  The estimated fair value is classified as Level 2.

10.  Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  Net periodic cost (benefit) of the Defined Benefit Pension, Post-Retirement Medical, and Supplemental Executive Retirement plans included in general insurance expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income includes the following components: 

On January 1, 2015, the Company acquired the retirement business of Putnam, an affiliate of the Company. See Note 2 for additional discussion regarding the acquisition.  Per the terms of the Asset Transfer Agreement, the Company was required to give each Putnam employee full credit for the employee s service period with Putnam prior to the closing date for the purpose of eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under the Post-Retirement Medical Plan.  As a result, approximately   150   individuals became eligible participants of the Post-Retirement Medical Plan at January 1, 2015.  The transaction was recorded as a prior service cost, which resulted in a   $339   increase before tax to other liabilities and expenses and a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income.

12.  Segment Information 
    
  The Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) of the Company is also the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) of the Company and Lifeco U.S. The CODM reviews the financial information for the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources based upon the results of Lifeco U.S. and other U.S. affiliates prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.  The CODM, in his capacity as CEO of the Company, reviews the Company s financial information only 
  in connection with the quarterly and annual reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
  Consequently, the Company does not provide its discrete financial information to the CODM to be regularly reviewed to make 
  decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess performance.  For purposes of SEC reporting requirements, the Company 
  has chosen to present its financial information in three segments, notwithstanding the above.  The   three   segments are: Individual Markets, Empower Retirement (formerly known as  Retirement Services ), and Other.

Unfavorable outcomes in such matters may result in a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  The Company is defending lawsuits relating to the costs and features of certain of its retirement or fund products.  These actions have not reached the trial stage.  Management believes the claims are without merit and will defend these actions.  Based on the information known, these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.  
    
  The Company is involved in other various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.  In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of loss from the resolution of these proceedings is remote and/or the estimated loss is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of its operations, or cash flows.

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 
    
  As used in this Form 10-Q, the  Company  refers to Great-West Life   Annuity Insurance Company, a stock life insurance company originally organized on March 28, 1907 and domiciled in the state of Colorado, and its subsidiaries. 
    
  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and that relate to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments.  In particular, statements using words such as  may,   would,   could,   should,   estimates,   expected,   anticipate,   believe,  or words of similar import generally involve forward-looking statements.  Without limiting the foregoing, forward-looking statements include statements that represent the Company s beliefs concerning future or projected levels of sales of its products, investment spreads or yields, or the earnings or profitability of the Company s activities. 
    
  Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company s control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change.  Some of these risks are described in  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.  Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, some of which may be global or national in scope, such as general economic conditions and interest rates, some of which may be related to the insurance industry generally, such as pricing competition, regulatory developments and industry consolidation, and others of which may relate to the Company specifically, such as credit, volatility, and other risks associated with its investment portfolio and other factors.  
    
  Readers should also consider other matters, including any risks and uncertainties, discussed in documents filed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The following discussion addresses the Company s results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  .  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  to which the reader is directed for additional information. 
    
  Recent Events 
    
  Empower Retirement continues to incur strategic and business development expenses as it focuses on enhancements, which will improve the client-facing experience as well as streamline the back-office processing over the next several years.  The Company originally anticipated investing approximately $150 million in total on this multi-year initiative and has invested $147 million by September 30, 2016.  The Company expects the remaining investment to complete integration activities to be approximately $5 million to $10 million.  In 2015, these costs decreased net earnings by $34 million and it is expected these costs will decrease net earnings by approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2016.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, these costs have decreased net earnings by $6 million and $19 million, respectively.    
    
  The Company has set an annual cost-savings target of $40 million to $50 million pre-tax.  Integration activities are expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2017 with the annual reduction of operating costs fully reflected upon the completion of the business transformation in the next two to three years.  These synergies are expected to be achieved through efficiencies from the conversion of business onto a single back-office platform, increased utilization of Great West Global Business Services India Private Limited ( Great West Global ), which launched in the third quarter of 2015, with 529 professionals based in India, as well as scale-driven cost improvements.  Ongoing operations will include amortization expense from system and infrastructure enhancements.  The Company expects that these enhancements will increase market share by driving future sales and improving the retention of participants and assets.  Empower Retirement participant accounts have grown to over 8 million at September 30, 2016 from 7.5 million at September 30, 2015. 
    
  On April 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a new rule redefining and expanding who is a fiduciary by reason of providing investment advice to a retirement plan or holder of an individual retirement account.  Compliance with the rule will generally be required by April 10, 2017 (certain parts by January 1, 2018).  The Company continues to analyze the rule against current business practices, primarily in its Empower Retirement and Individual Markets businesses.  The rule may require changes to certain aspects of product and service delivery but management does not expect that it will prevent the Company from executing on its overall business strategy and growth objectives.

Current Market Conditions 
    
  The S P 500 index at   September 30, 2016   was up by 3% compared to   June 30, 2016   and up by 6% compared to   January 1, 2016  .  The S P 500 index at   September 30, 2015   was down by 7% compared to   June 30, 2015   and was down by 7% compared to   January 1, 2015  .  The average of the S P 500 index was up by 7% during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and was down by less than 1% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, when compared to the same period in 2015. 

Variable asset-based fees earned by the Company fluctuate with changes in participant account balances.  Participant account balances change due to cash flow and unrealized market gains and losses, which are primarily associated with changes in the U.S. equities market.  Fee income increased for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the variance was primarily due to higher asset-based fees, driven by growth in these assets, due to positive net cash flows and higher average equity market levels. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the variance was primarily due to higher asset-based fees, driven by growth in these assets, due to positive net cash flows. 
    
  Interest rates decreased during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 2015 when interest rates were volatile.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate at   September 30, 2016  , was up by 11 basis points as compared to   June 30, 2016   and was down by 67 basis points as compared to   January 1, 2016  .  The rate at   September 30, 2015   was down by 29 basis points as compared to   June 30, 2015   and was down by 11 basis points as compared to   January 1, 2015  .  The average of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was down by 66 basis points when compared to   2015   and the rate during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was down by 38 basis points when compared to   2015  . 

The Company employs hedging strategies for the purpose of managing the interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and equity market risks impacting the Company s business.  For those derivative instruments when hedge accounting is not elected, all gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.  As a result, fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, or equity markets may cause the Company to experience volatility in its earnings.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded unfavorable changes in unrealized gains (losses), net, on forward settling to be announced ( TBA ) securities of $41 million as compared to   2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded favorable changes of $18 million in unrealized gains (losses), net, primarily due to cross-currency swaps.  Additionally, the realized gains (losses), net, on forward settling TBA securities had favorable changes of $11 million and $25 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   2015  . 
    
  Unrealized gains (losses) on fixed maturity investments fluctuate with changes in the prevailing interest rates.  When interest rates rise, market values of fixed maturity investments generally fall.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , fixed maturity investments' unrealized investment gains (losses), net, recognized in net income, had an unfavorable change of $5 million, as compared to   2015  . Conversely, when prevailing interest rates fall, market values of fixed maturity investments rise. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   there was a favorable change of $6 million compared to   2015  .  The Company also recorded in other comprehensive income favorable changes in unrealized gains (losses), net, on fixed maturity investments, of   $48 million   and   $846 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared  
  
   44 

to unfavorable changes of   $10 million   and   $355 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The realized gains (losses), net, on fixed maturity investments had a favorable change of $6 million and $31 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   2015  . 
    
  Reconciliation of Net Income to Operating Income 
    
  The Company uses the same accounting policies and procedures to measure operating income as it uses to measure consolidated net income. The Company employs hedging strategies for the purpose of managing the interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and equity market risks impacting the Company s business.  For some derivative instruments, hedge accounting is not elected; therefore, all gains or losses from these transactions are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.  As a result, fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, or equity markets may cause the Company to experience volatility in net income.  As such, the Company has defined operating income as net income, excluding realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and derivatives and their related tax effect.  Operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP     ).  In addition, the Company s operating income measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended September 30, 2015    
    
  The Company believes that the presentation of operating income enhances the understanding of the Company s performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.  Operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.  The following is a summary of the contributions of each segment to net income and a reconciliation of net income to operating income: 

(1)    Calculated utilizing estimated tax rate of 35%. 
    
  Unrealized investment gains (losses), net, had an unfavorable change of   $78 million  , or   113%  , from a gain of   $69 million   in   2015   to a loss of   $9 million   in   2016  .  The change was due to a $41 million unfavorable change from forward settling TBA securities, a $32 million unfavorable change from derivatives, and a $5 million unfavorable change from bonds.  
    
  Realized investment gains (losses), net, had a favorable change of   $10 million  , or   43%  , to   $33 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  The change was due to a $10 million favorable change from forward settling TBA securities and a $6 million favorable change from bonds, partially offset by a $6 million unfavorable change from derivatives. 
    
  Pro-rata tax expense decreased by   $24 million  , to an expense of   $8 million   in   2016  , primarily resulting from the unfavorable change in total unrealized investment gains (losses), net.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015

The change was driven by an $18 million favorable change in unrealized gains on derivatives and a $6 million favorable change in unrealized gains on bonds, offset by unrealized losses on forward settling TBA securities of $7 million. 
    
  Realized investment gains (losses), net, had a favorable change of   $50 million  , or   88%  , to   $107 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  The change was driven by a favorable change of $31 million from gains on bonds and a $25 million favorable change in gains on forward settling TBA security transactions, partially offset by unfavorable changes of $6 million in derivatives. 
    
  Pro-rata tax expense increased by   $24 million  , or   62%  , to   $63 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  , resulting from the favorable change in unrealized and realized investment gains (losses), net.

  Operating expenses increased by   $7 million  , or   2%  , to   $318 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of higher headcount due to business growth, partially offset by lower deferred acquisition costs ( DAC ) amortization. 
    
  Income tax expense increased by   $8 million  , from a benefit of   $1 million   in   2015   to an expense of   $7 million   in   2016   primarily due to higher operating income before tax.

  Policyholder benefits decreased by   $11 million  , or   1%  , to   $947 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily driven by more lapses on term life insurance policies, partially offset by higher policyholder benefits in Individual Markets due to unfavorable mortality experience.

  Net investment income had a favorable change of   $3 million  , or   1%  , to   $569 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .  This was due to higher investment income earned on bonds, mortgages, and policy loans as a result of higher invested asset balances, partially offset by lower yields. 
    
  Policyholder benefits increased by   $24 million  , or   3%  , to   $750 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience. 
    
  Operating expenses increased by   $10 million  , or   9%  , to   $127 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of higher headcount due to business growth. 
    
  Income tax expense decreased by   $9 million  , or   27%  , to   $24 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower operating income before tax.

The change was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of higher headcount due to business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization. 
    
  Income tax changed by   $26 million  , from an expense of   $15 million   to a benefit of   $11 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  .

Other Segment Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended September 30, 2015    
    
  The following is a summary of certain financial data of the Company s Other segment:    

Operating loss for the Company s Other segment decreased by   $9 million  , or   82%  , to a loss of   $2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a loss of   $11 million   in   2015  .  The decrease in operating loss is primarily due to lower policyholder benefits, partially offset by higher income tax expense. 
    
  Policyholder benefits decreased by   $19 million  , or   58%  , to   $14 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to more lapses on term life insurance policies compared to the prior year. 
    
  Income tax benefit decreased by   $6 million  , or   100%  , to no expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to lower operating loss before tax.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    
    
  The following is a summary of certain financial data of the Company s Other segment: 

Operating income for the Company s Other segment increased by   $20 million  , or   133%  , to   $5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to a loss of   $15 million   in the same period in   2015  .  The change in operating income is primarily due to lower policyholder benefits, partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher operating expenses. 
    
  Policyholder benefits decreased by   $38 million  , or   47%  , to   $43 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily driven by more lapses on term life insurance policies compared to the prior year.

  Income tax expense increased by   $11 million  , or   138%  , to an expense of   $3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a benefit of   $8 million   in 2015 primarily due to higher operating income before income taxes. 

54 

Investment Operations 
    
  The Company s primary investment objective is to acquire assets with duration and cash flow characteristics reflective of its liabilities, while meeting industry, size, issuer, and geographic diversification standards.  Formal liquidity and credit quality parameters have also been established. 
    
  The Company follows rigorous procedures to control interest rate risk and observes strict asset and liability matching guidelines.  These guidelines ensure that even under changing market conditions, the Company s assets should meet the cash flow and income requirements of its liabilities. Using dynamic modeling to analyze the effects of a range of possible market changes upon investments and policyholder benefits, the Company works to ensure that its investment portfolio is appropriately structured to fulfill financial obligations to its policyholders. 
    
  The following table presents the percentage distribution of the carrying values of the Company s general account investment portfolio:  

Fixed Maturity Investments 
    
  Fixed maturity investments include public and privately placed corporate bonds, government bonds, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.  Included in available-for-sale fixed maturities are perpetual debt investments which primarily consist of junior subordinated debt instruments that have no stated maturity date but pay fixed or floating interest in perpetuity.  The Company s strategy related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is to focus on those investments with low prepayment risk and minimal credit risk. 
    
  Private placement investments are generally less marketable than publicly traded assets, yet they typically offer enhanced covenant protection that allows the Company, if necessary, to take appropriate action to protect its investment.  The Company believes that the cost of the additional monitoring and analysis required by private placement investments is more than offset by their enhanced yield. 
    
  One of the Company s primary objectives is to ensure that its fixed maturity portfolio is maintained at a high average credit quality to limit credit risk.  All securities are internally rated by the Company on a basis intended to be similar to that of the rating agencies.  The Company s internal rating methodology generally takes into account ratings from Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, Fitch Ratings, and Moody s Investor Services, Inc.  In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) implemented a ratings methodology for residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), and other structured securities.  The Company may also utilize inputs from this ratings process to develop its internal rating. 
    
  The percentage distribution of the estimated fair value of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio by the Company s internal credit rating is summarized as follows:   

55 

The   September 30, 2016  , AAA rating percentage decreased as compared to   December 31, 2015  , as the Company sold AAA-rated government agency MBS pools to enter into forward settling TBA contracts which are treated as derivatives. 
    
  The percentage distribution of the estimated fair value of the corporate sector fixed maturity portfolio, calculated as a percentage of fixed maturities, is summarized as follows: 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
    
  The Company s mortgage loans on real estate are comprised primarily of domestic commercial collateralized real estate loans.  The mortgage loan portfolio is diversified with regard to geographical markets and commercial real estate property types within the United States.  The Company originates, directly or through correspondents, real estate mortgages with the intent to hold to maturity.  The Company s portfolio includes loans which are fully amortizing, amortizing with a balloon balance at maturity, interest only to maturity, and interest only for a number of years followed by an amortizing period.   
    
  Derivatives 
    
  The Company uses certain derivatives, such as futures, swaps, and interest rate swaptions, for purposes of managing the interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and equity market risks impacting the Company s business.  These derivatives, when taken alone, may subject the Company to varying degrees of market and credit risk; however, since used for hedging purposes, these instruments are intended to reduce risk.  For derivative instruments where hedge accounting is not elected, changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, or equity markets may generate derivative gains or losses which may cause the Company to experience volatility in net income.  The Company also uses forward settling TBA securities to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of agency mortgage-backed securities (pass-throughs).  These transactions enhance the return on the Company s investment portfolio and provide a more liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than purchasing or selling individual agency mortgage-backed pools.  The Company controls the credit risk of its over-the-counter derivative contracts through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and in most cases, requiring collateral.  Risk of loss is generally limited to the portion of the fair value of derivative instruments that exceeds the value of the collateral held and not to the notional or contractual amounts of the derivatives.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company s management to adopt accounting policies to enable them to make a significant variety of accounting and actuarial estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends, and other information that is reasonable given the facts and circumstances for the Company.  These critical estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.  Actual results can differ from the amounts previously estimated, which were based on information available at the time the estimates were made. 
    
  The Company has identified the following accounting policies, judgments, and estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: 
    
                Valuation of investments; 
                Impairment of investments; 
                Valuation of derivatives and related hedge accounting; 
                Valuation of DAC and related amortization (including unlocking of assumptions); and 
                Valuation of policy benefit liabilities 
    
  A discussion of each of these critical accounting policies may be found in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
    
  Application of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See Note 3 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the application of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term needs of its operations.  The Company manages its operations to create stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of its obligations. 
    
  The principal sources of the Company s liquidity are premiums and contract deposits, fees, investment income, and investment maturities and sales.  Funds provided from these sources are reasonably predictable and normally exceed liquidity requirements for payment of policy benefits, payments to policy and contractholders in connection with surrenders and withdrawals, and general expenses.  However, since the timing of available funds cannot always be matched precisely to commitments, imbalances may arise when demands for funds exceed those on hand.  A primary liquidity concern regarding cash flows from operations is the risk of early policyholder and contractholder withdrawals.  A primary liquidity concern regarding investment activity is the risk of defaults and market volatility. 
    
  In addition, a demand for funds may arise as a result of the Company taking advantage of current investment opportunities.  The sources of the funds that may be required in such situations include the issuance of commercial paper or other debt instruments. 
    
  Management believes that the liquidity profile of its assets is sufficient to satisfy the short-term liquidity requirements of reasonably foreseeable scenarios. 
    
  Generally, the Company has met its operating requirements by utilizing cash flows from operations and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity in its investment portfolio.  Liquidity for the Company has remained strong, as evidenced by the amounts of short-term investments and cash that totaled   $432 million   and   $301 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , short-term investments included above exclude any amounts held to settle TBA forward contracts.  In addition,   99%   of the fixed maturity portfolio carried an investment grade rating at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , which provides significant liquidity to the Company s overall investment portfolio. 
    
  The Company continues to be well capitalized, with sufficient borrowing capacity.  Additionally, the Company anticipates that cash on hand and expected net cash generated by operating activities will exceed the forecasted needs of the business over the next 12 months.  The Company s financial strength provides the capacity and flexibility to enable it to raise funds in the capital  
  
   57 

markets through the issuance of commercial paper.  The Company had   $100 million   and   $93 million   of commercial paper outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The commercial paper has been given a rating of A-1+ by Standard   Poor s Ratings Services and a rating of P-1 by Moody s Investors Service, each being the highest rating available.  Through the recent financial market volatility, the Company continued to have the ability to access the capital markets for funds.  The loss of this access in the future would not have a significant impact to the Company s liquidity as commercial paper is not used to fund daily operations and is an insignificant amount in relation to total invested assets. 
    
  The Company also has available a revolving credit facility agreement with U.S. Bank, which expires on March 1, 2018, in the amount of $50 million for general corporate purposes.  The Company had no borrowings under this credit facility as of or during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The Company does not anticipate the need for borrowings under this facility and the loss of its availability would not significantly impact its liquidity. 
    
  Capital resources provide protection for policyholders and financial strength to support the underwriting of insurance risks and allow for continued business growth.  The amount of capital resources that may be needed is determined by the Company s senior management and Board of Directors, as well as by regulatory requirements.  The allocation of resources to new long-term business commitments is designed to achieve an attractive return, tempered by considerations of risk and the need to support the Company s existing business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company makes commitments to fund partnership interests, mortgage loans on real estate, and other investments in the normal course of its business.  The amounts of these unfunded commitments at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were   $376 million   and   $51 million  , respectively.  The precise timing of the fulfillment of the commitment cannot be predicted; however, these amounts are due within one year of the dates indicated.  There are no other obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements that are reasonably likely to become material. 
     
  The Company participates in a short-term reverse repurchase program for the purpose of enhancing the total return on its investment portfolio.  This type of transaction involves the purchase of securities with a simultaneous agreement to sell similar securities at a future date at an agreed-upon price.  In exchange, the financial institutions put non-cash collateral on deposit with a third-party custodian on behalf of the Company.  The amount of securities purchased in connection with these transactions was   $300 million   and zero at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Non-cash collateral on deposit with the third-party custodian on the Company s behalf was   $306 million   and   zero   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged and which has not been recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Collateral related to the reverse repurchase agreements generally consists of U.S. government or U.S. government agency securities. 
    
  The Company participates in a securities lending program in which the Company lends securities that are held as part of its general account investment portfolio to third parties for the purpose of enhancing the total return on its investment portfolio.  The Company generally requires initial collateral in an amount greater than or equal to 102% of the fair value of domestic securities loaned and 105% of foreign securities loaned.  The Company received securities with a fair value of   $66 million   as collateral at   September 30, 2016  , which have not been recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as the Company does not have effective control.  There were   no   securities on loan and therefore   no   securities were received as collateral at   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 3.               Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  The Company has established processes and procedures to effectively identify, monitor, measure, and manage the risks associated with its invested assets and its interest rate sensitive insurance and annuity products.  Management has identified investment portfolio management, including the use of derivative instruments, insurance and annuity product design, and asset/liability management as three critical means to accomplish a successful risk management program. 
    
  The major risks to which the Company is exposed include the following:  

Market risk - the potential of loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and equity market prices and the levels of their volatility. 
                
    Insurance risk - the potential of loss resulting from claims, persistency, and expense experience exceeding that assumed in the liabilities held. 
                
    Credit risk - the potential of loss arising from an obligator s inability or unwillingness to meet its obligations to the Company. 
     
   58 

Operational and corporate risk - the potential of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from other external events. 
        
  A discussion of each of these risk factors may be found in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , under Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

59 

Item 4.             Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Principal Financial  Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ).  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  As disclosed in Item 9A,  Controls and Procedures,  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. There has been no significant change in the control environment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Management is committed to continuing to improve its internal control processes and will continue to review its financial reporting controls and procedures. 

60 

Part II                Other Information 

Item 1.               Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time, the Company may be threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits, mediations, arbitrations, and administrative claims.  Any such claims that are decided against the Company could harm the Company s business.  The Company is also subject to periodic regulatory audits and inspections which could result in fines or other disciplinary actions.  Unfavorable outcomes in such matters may result in a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  The Company is defending lawsuits relating to the costs and features of certain of its retirement or fund products.  These actions have not reached the trial stage.  Management believes the claims are without merit and will defend these actions.  Based on the information known, these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.  
    
  The Company is involved in other various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.  In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of loss from the resolution of these proceedings is remote and/or the estimated loss is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of its operations or cash flows.    

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  In the normal course of its business, the Company is exposed to certain operational, regulatory, and financial risks and uncertainties.  The most significant risks include the following: 

Competition could negatively affect the ability of the Company to maintain or increase market share or profitability. 

The insurance and financial services industries are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce profitability. 

A downgrade or potential downgrade in the Company s financial strength or claims paying ratings could result in a loss of business and negatively affect results of operations and financial condition. 

Deviations from assumptions regarding future persistency, mortality, and interest rates used in calculating liabilities for future policyholder benefits and claims could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company may be required to accelerate the amortization of DAC or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 

If the companies that provide reinsurance default or fail to perform or the Company is unable to obtain adequate reinsurance for some of the risks underwritten, the Company could incur significant losses adversely affecting results of operations and financial condition. 

Interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on results of operations and financial condition. 

Market fluctuations and general economic conditions may adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. 

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of the Company s products less attractive to consumers and increase its tax costs. 

The Company may be subject to litigation resulting in substantial awards or settlements and this may adversely affect its reputation and results of operations. 

The Company s risk management policies and procedures may leave it exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

61 

The Company may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through its current and future distribution channels. 

A failure in cyber or information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage the Company s reputation, and could impair its ability to conduct business effectively. 

The Company could face difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, or asset impairments arising from business acquisitions or integrations and managing growth of such businesses.
