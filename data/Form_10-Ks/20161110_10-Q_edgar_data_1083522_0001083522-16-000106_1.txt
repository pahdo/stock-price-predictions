EXPLANATORY NOTE 

Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  we,   us,   our,   Jones,   Jones Soda,  and the  Company  are to Jones Soda Co., a Washington corporation, and our wholly-owned subsidiaries  ,   Jones Soda Co. (USA) Inc. and Jones Soda (Canada) Inc. 

In addition, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report to    Jones Soda    refer to our premium soda, including Jones      Soda, Jones Zilch      and Jones Stripped      sold under the trademarked brand name    Jones Soda Co.       

CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We desire to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report ) contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management s current views and expectations with respect to our business, strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements that address operating performance, the economy, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements related to case sales, revenues, profitability, distributor channels, new products, adequacy of funds from operations, cash flows and financing, our ability to continue as a going concern, potential strategic transactions, statements regarding future operating results and non-historical information, are forward-looking statements. In particular, the words such as  believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   may,   will,   can,   plan,   predict,   could,   future,  "continue," variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. 

Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on management s current expectations and projections about future events, are not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and apply only as of the date of this Report. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as from the results expressed in, anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

In particular, our business, including our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern may be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 

Our ability to successfully execute on our   growth   strategy and our operating plan;     

Our ability to establish, maintain and expand distribution arrangements with independent distributors, retailers, brokers and national retail accounts, most of whom sell and distribute competing products, and whom we rely upon to employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, including re-stocking the retail shelves with our products, on which our business plan and future growth are dependent in part;     

Our ability to respond to any changes   in, and to maintain,   our private l  abel relationship with 7-Eleven  ;       

Consumer response to and market acceptance of 7-Select     ,     our cobranded product with 7-Eleven, and our new product, Lemoncocco;     

The timing and amount of reorders for 7-Select     , including the impact on our inventory  ,    revenue   and cash flow  ;     

Our ability to effectively manage and grow international distribution and sales;     

Competition in the fountain business, particularly from Coke and Pepsi;     

Entrance into and increased focus on the craft beverage segment from Coke and Pepsi;     

Our ability to successfully develop and launch new products that match consumer beverage trends;     

Imposition of new taxes, including potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages;     

Public perception of the beverage industry and changes in consumer preferences;     

Our ability to increase revenues and achieve case sales goals;     

Our ability to manage our operating expenses and generate cash flow from operations  ;     

Ou  r ability to secure additional financing  , including on terms acceptable to us, if and when needed;     

Our ability to respond to changes in the consumer beverage marketplace, including potential reduced consumer demand due to health concerns (including obesity) and legislative initiatives against sweetened beverages;     

3   

Table of Contents     

Changes in pricing and SKUs of our products;     

Our ability to manage our inventory levels and to predict the timing and amount of our sales;     

Our reliance on third-party contract manufacturers of our products and the geographic locations of their facilities, which could make management of our distribution efforts inefficient or unprofitable;     

Our ability to secure a continuous supply and availability of raw materials, as well as other factors affecting our supply chain including increases in raw material costs and shortages of glass in the supply chain;     

High or rising fuel and freight costs may have an adverse impact on our results of operations;     

Fluctuations in currency     exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. and Canadian dollars, can adversely impact our results of operations;     

Our ability to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key flavor suppliers;     

Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including retaining the services of our CEO  ,     which would directly affect our efficiency and operations and could materially impair our ability to execute our   growth   strategy;     

Our inability to protect our trademarks and trade secrets, which may prevent us from successfully marketing our products and competing effectively;     

Our ability to create and maintain brand name recognition and acceptance of our products, which is critical to our success in our competitive, brand-conscious industry;     

Our ability to maintain brand image and product quality and avoid risks from other product issues such as product recalls;     

Our ability to compete successfully against much larger, well-funded, established companies currently operating in the beverage industry;     

Litigation or legal proceedings, which could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation;     

Our ability to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting;     

Our ability to maintain an effective information technology infrastructure;     

Dilutive and other adverse effects on our existing shareholders and our stock price arising from future securities issuances;     

Our ability to access the capital markets for any future equity financing, and any actual or perceived limitations to our common stock by being traded on the OTCQB Marketplace, including the level of trading activity, volatility or market liquidity;     

Regional, national or global economic conditions that may adversely impact our business and results of operations; and     

Our ability to comply with the many regulations to which our business is subject.     

For a discussion of some of the factors that may affect our business, results and prospects, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March   24  ,    2016  . Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this Report and in our other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and those described from time to time in our press releases and other communications, which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, prospects and results of operations.

JONES SODA CO. 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

1.     Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Jones Soda Co. develops, produces, markets and distributes premium beverages which   it   sell  s   and distribute  s   primarily in   United States and Canada   through   its   network of independent distributors and directly to   its   national and regional retail accounts.  

We are a Washington corporation and have   two   operating subsidiaries, Jones Soda Co. (USA) Inc. and Jones Soda (Canada) Inc. ( Subsidiaries ). 

Basis of presentation and consolidation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016, has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations applicable to interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between us and our subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments, consisting only of those of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Liquidity 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash-equivalents of approximately $767,000 and working capital of   $  2.1   million. Cash used in operations during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $  420,000 compared to $711,000   for the same period a year ago. The decrease in cash used in operations compared to the same period a year ago is primarily due to an increase in sales volume less cash used in connection with the reduction in inventory on hand. We reported net income of $69  ,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

As of the date of this Report, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, combined with our Loan Facility and anticipated cash from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through September 30, 2017.  

We have a revolving secured credit facility (the  Loan Facility ) with   CapitalSource   Business Finance   Group  . The Loan Facility allows us to borrow a maximum aggregate amount of up to   $3.2 million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. As of September 30, 2016, our accounts receivable and inventory eligible borrowing base was approximately $  1.7   million, of which we had drawn down  approximately   $1.3   million.   See   N  ote 3 for further information. 

We may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business, our markets and the broader economy. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary, we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, which may include, without limitation, public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, a rights offering, and other strategic alternatives; however, these options may not ultimately be available or feasible. 

The uncertainties relating to our ability to successfully execute on our business plan and finance our operations continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements for the periods presented were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

Table of Contents   

These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Seasonality and other fluctuations 

Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Sales may fluctuate materially on a quarter to quarter basis or an annual basis when we launch a new product or fill the  pipeline  of a new distribution partner or a large retail partner such as 7-Eleven.  Sales results may also fluctuate based on the number of SKUs selected or removed by our distributors and retail partners through the normal course of serving consumers in the dynamic, trend-oriented beverage industry. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year. 

Net income (loss) per share 

The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in thousands, except share data): 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, inventory valuation, depreciable lives and valuation of capital assets, valuation allowances for receivables, trade promotion liabilities, stock-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets, contingencies, and forecasts supporting the going concern assumption and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standard Update (  ASU  ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The ASU is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In June 2015, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of the new revenue standard, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early adoption prior to the original effective date is not permitted. We are evaluating the impact this standard may have on our revenue recognition, but do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   (Topic 330)  ,   to amend Topic 330, Inventory. Topic 330 currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory measured using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost method be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 is required for fiscal  

10   

Table of Contents   

reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The ASU is intended to provide more transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases than previous guidance. The ASU is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, and adoption must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We are evaluating the impact of this standard but do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   which amends ASC 718  , Compensation   Stock Compensation  . The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various provisions related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The ASU is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. We are evaluating the impact of this standard but do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements. 

2.     Inventory 

Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Finished goods primarily include product ready for shipment, as well as promotional merchandise held for sale. Raw materials primarily include ingredients, concentrate and packaging. 

3.     Line of Credit 

We have   a revolving secured Loan Facility with     CapitalSource Business Finance Group  ( CapitalSource )  , pursuant to which we, through our Subsidiaries, may borrow a maximum aggregate amount of up to   $3.2   million, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions.   We originally entered into this Loan Facility on December 27, 2013, and amended and renewed it for an additional year as of December   18  , 201  5 and January 7, 2016  . 

Under this     Loan Facility, we may periodically request advances equal to the lesser of: (a) $3.2 million, or (b) the Borrowing Base which is, in the following priority, the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible U.S. accounts receivable, plus (ii) 35% of finished goods inventory not to exceed $475,000, plus (iii) 50% of eligible Canadian accounts receivable not to exceed $300,000, subject to any reserve amount established by CapitalSource  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our   accounts receivable and inventory   eligible borrowing base was approximately   $1.7   million, of which we had drawn down   approximately $1.3 million  . Advances under the Loan Facility   as amended in January 2016,   bear interes  t at the prime rate plus   1%  ,    and a loan fee of   0.15%   on the daily loan balance is payable to CapitalSource on a monthly basis   with a minimum annual interest requirement of   $30,000  .    The Loan Facility has a term of one year which automatically extends for successive one year terms unless either party gives at least 30 days' prior written notice of its intent to terminate the Loan Facility at the end of the then current term. The Company pays an annual fee of 0.75% of the total commitment.  

CapitalSource has the right to terminate the Loan Facility at any time upon 120 days  prior written notice.   All present and future obligations of the Subsidiaries arising under the Loan Facility are guaranteed by us and are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets. The Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  ,    we were in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Facility  .     The draws on the Loan Facility were used to fulfill working capital needs. We will continue to utilize the Loan Facility, as needed, for working capital needs in the future. 

4.       Warrants 

I  n February 2012   as part of our registered offering,   we sold   and issued   w  arrants   for the   purchase   of   up to   3,207,500   shares of common stock.   Each   w  arrant has an exercise price of   $  0.70   per share, for total potential proceeds to us of up to   $  2,245,250   if all of the   w  arrants are exercised in full for cash. The   w  arrants are exercisable for cash or, solely in the absence of an effective registration statement, by cashless exercise. The exercise price of the   w  arrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions, and also upon any distributions to Company shareholders, business combinations, sale of substantially all assets and other fundamental transactions. The  

11   

Table of Contents   

exercise of the   w  arrants is subject to certain beneficial ownership   limitations   and other   restrictions   set forth in the   w  arrant   document  s. The term of the   w  arrants expire  s   on   August     6, 2017  .    Any remaining   w  arrants that are outstanding on   August 6, 2017  , the expiration date, will automatically be exercised at that time by cashless exercise   (to the extent that the volume weighted average trading price of our common stock as of such date exceeds the warrant exercise price). 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,    3,057,500   of the   w  arrants remain outstanding  .     No     w  arrants were exercised during the     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

5.    Shareholders  Equity 

Under the terms of our 2011 Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), the number of shares authorized under the Plan may be increased each January 1st by an amount equal to the least of (a)   1,300,000   shares, (b)   4.0  %   of our outstanding common stock as of the end of our immediately preceding fiscal year, and (c) a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors (the  Board ), provided that the number of shares that may be granted pursuant to awards in a single year may not exceed   10  %   of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. Effective January 1,   2016  , the total number of shares of common stock authorized under the Plan   increased to   9  ,  4  84,032   shares  . 

Under the terms of the Plan, the Board may grant awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors. Awards may consist of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, stock units, performance awards or other stock or cash-based awards. Stock options are granted at the closing price of our stock on the date of grant, and generally have a   ten  -year   term and vest over a period of   48   months   with the first   25.0  %   cliff vesting   one   year   from the grant date and monthly thereafter. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   3,712,538   shares of unissued common stock authorized and available for future awards under the Plan.

A summary of our stock option activity is as follows: 

(b)    Stock-based compensation expense: 

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the employees  requisite service period. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or restricted stock expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required in future periods. 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options of   $  176,000   to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.7   years. 

The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense attributable to stock options (in thousands):  

We employ the following key weighted-average assumptions in determining the fair value of stock options, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the simplified method to estimate the expected term of  plain vanilla  options:

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $  152,000   and   $  120,000   and for options exercisable was   $  120,000   and   $  64,000  , respectively. The intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable stock options is calculated as the quoted market price of the stock at the balance sheet date less the exercise price of the option. There were   25,833   and   342,500   options exercised   during the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of the options exercised during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, was   $  3  ,000   and   $2,000   respectively.   

6.     Segment Information 

We have   one   operating segment with operations primarily in the United States and Canada. Sales are assigned to geographic locations based on the location of customers. Sales by geographic location are as follows (in thousands): 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,    five   and   three   of our customers represented approximately   5  5  %     and   23%  , respectively  , of revenue  .     During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and   2015  ,    two     and   three   of our customers represented approximately   2  2  %     and   17  %  , respectively  , of revenue  .

Overview 

We develop, produce, market and distribute premium beverages   in various formats for our core Jones Soda lines, Lemoncocco Brand and private label initiatives,   which we sell and distribute primarily in   the United States and Canada   through our network of independent distributors and directly to our national and regional retail accounts.     We also sell products in select international markets. Our products are sold primarily in grocery stores, convenience and gas stores,  up and down the street  in independent accounts such as delicatessens and sandwich shops, as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. We refer to our network of independent distributors as our direct store delivery (DSD) channel, and we refer to our national and regional accounts who receive shipments directly from us as our direct to retail (DTR) channel. We do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party contract manufacturers.     We also sell various products online, including soda with customized labels, wearables, candy and other items, and we license our trademarks for use on products sold by other manufacturers.  

Our   Focus   for Fiscal 2016:   Sales Growth 

Our focus for fiscal 2016 is driving to profitability through case sale and revenue growth. Over the past three and a half years, we implemented substantial internal changes to our organization, and     have achieved significant reductions in our operating expenses   and efficiencies in our operations  . 

The following   are   key components of this   focus for 2016  : 

Utilize the strategic distribution improvements implemented across   the United States and Canada   to grow national and  independent account sales of our core   Jones Soda   lines;     

Build upon partnerships with major retail chains, such as 7-E  leven, Inc.  , while continuing to build our base of independent accounts;     

Expand our fountain program of our core product lines in the United States and Canadian marketplaces;      

Build the   Lemoncocco   brand in select markets in the United States and Canada; and     

Increase the focus on international expansion.

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

Selling and marketing expenses for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     were   $  515  ,000  ,    a  n     increase   of   $  14,000  , or   2.8%  , from $  501  ,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .    Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to   1  2  .  6  %   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   13.3  %   in   2015  . We will continue to balance selling and marketing expenses with our working capital resources.     For the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015, non-cash   expenses     included in selling and marketing   expense   (stock compensation and depreciation)   were $10,000 and $13,000, respectively.    

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     were $  499  ,000  , a  n     increase   of $  54,000   or   12.1%  , compared to $  445  ,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  ,    due   primarily to stock compensation expense  .   General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue   remained relatively flat at     1  2  .  2  %   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     compared to     11  .  8  %   in   2015  . We will continue to   carefully     manage     general and administrative expenses with our working capital resources.     For the three months end  ed   September 30, 2016 and 2015, non-cash expenses included in   general and administrative expense   (stock compensation and depreciation) were $  65  ,000 and $1  5  ,000, respectively.    

Income Tax Expense 

We had   $9,000     income tax expense for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to $  0    for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily related to the tax provision on income from our Canadian operations. We have not recorded any tax benefit for the loss in our U.S. operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved U.S. operations. Our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors, including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions, estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. 

Net   income (loss) 

Net   income   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016     was    $  69  ,000   compared to a   net loss of $  179  ,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   due to the     increase in case volume   and   new   product offering  s  . 

Nine   Months Ended   September     30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September   30, 2015 

Revenue 

For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue was approximately   $12.7 million, an increase of   approximately     $1.  7   million  , or 16.0% from   approximately   $10.9 million for   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This was driven by case sales volume increase of 26.7% compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the initial product launch ( pipeline fill ) of   7-Select into participating 7-Eleven locations across the United States in 2016.  

For the nine months ended September 30,   2016   trade spend and promotion allowances, which offset revenue, totaled   approximately   $1  .4 million   an increase of   $  379  ,000   or 35.  5  %, from   approximately   $1  .1 million   in 2015, due primarily to the launch of   7-Select. 

Gross Profit  

For the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   gross profit increased by   $616,000   or 22.5%, to   approximately   $3.4 million compared to   approximately   $2.7 million for the     nine months ended September 30,   2015   due to efficiencies related to the pipeline fill of 7-Select, as well as, the favorable impact of the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate on productions costs during the period.   For the   nine months ended September 30,   2016   gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.5% from 25.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

Selling and marketing expenses for the   nine months ended September 30,   2016   were approximately   $1.6     million  ,      an increase of $  100,000  , or   6.8%  ,    from   approximately   $1.5     million   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , due primarily to expenses associated with the launch of 7-Select. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue   decreased     to   12.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30,   2016  , from   13  .  4  %   in   2015  . We will continue to balance selling and marketing expenses with our working capital resources.     For the   nine   months end  ed   September 30, 2016 and 2015, non-cash expenses included in selling and marketing   expense   (stock compensation and depreciation) were $  37  ,000 and $  46  ,000, respectively.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30,   2016   were   approximately   $1.7   million  , a  n   increase of   $51,000   or   3.2%  , compared to   approximately   $1.6     million   for the   nine months ended September 30,   2015,   due primarily to costs associated with our 7-Select product launch.   General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue   decreased   to   13.0%   for the    nine months ended September 30,   2016   from   1  4  .6%   in   2015  . We will continue to carefully ma  nage general and administrative expenses with our working capital resources.     For the   nine   months end  ed   September 30, 2016 and 2015, non-cash expenses included in   general and administrative expense   (stock compensation and depreciation) were $  123  ,000 and $1  27  ,000, respectively. 

Income Tax Expense 

We had   $25,000     of   income tax expense for     the   nine months ended September 30,   2016  ,     primarily related to the tax provision on income from our Canadian operations.   Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $17,000.   We have not recorded any tax benefit for the loss in our U.S. operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved U.S. operations. Our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors, including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions, estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets. 

Net   income (l  oss  ) 

Net   income   for the   nine months ended September 30,   2016   was $  53  ,000 compared to a net loss of $  575  ,000 for the   nine months ended September 30,   2015 due to the   increase in case volume as discussed above  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash-equivalents of approximately   $  767  ,000 and working capital of   $  2.  1   million. Cash used in operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $  420  ,000   compared to   $  711  ,000   for the same period a year ago. The   de  crease in cash used in operations compared to the same period a year ago is   primarily due   to an increase   in sales volume     less cash used in connection with the   reduction in inventory on hand  . We   had     net income   of     $  53  ,  000 for the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

As of the date of this Report, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  , combined with our Loan Facility and anticipated cash from operations,   will be sufficient to meet our anticipated   working capital requirements   through     September   30  , 2017  .   

We have a revolving secured credit facility with   CapitalSource   Business Finance   Group  . The Loan Facility   currently   allows us to borrow a maximum aggregate amount of up   to   $3.  2    million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  .     As of   September   30  , 2016  , our   accounts receivable and inventory   eligible borrowing base was approximately   $1.7   million, of which we had drawn down   approximately $1.3 million  .    We   intend   use the Loan Facility for our working capital needs. The Loan Facility is available for   future borrowing, as discussed further   in Note 3     of   our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . 

We may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. We intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business, our markets and the broader economy. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary, we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, which may include, without limitation, public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, a rights offering, and other strategic alternatives; however, these options may not ultimately be available or feasible. 

The uncertainties relating to our ability to successfully execute on our   business plan and finance our operations   continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements for the periods presented were prepared assuming we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and

classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that could result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Seasonality   and other F  luctuations 

Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September.   Sales may   fluc  t  uate   materially on a quarter to quarter basis or an annual basis when   we launch   a new initiative or   fill the  pipeline  of a new distribution partner or a large retail partner such as 7-Eleven.  Sales results may also fluctuate based on the number of SKUs selected or removed by   our   distributors and retail partners through the normal course of serving consumers in the dynamic, trend-oriented beverage industry.   As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year. 

Off-B  alance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

See the information concerning our critical accounting policies included under  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Critical Accounting Policies  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,   201  5  , filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March   24  ,    201  6  . There   have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 4.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and   our   Vice President of Finance  , evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as o  f    September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and   our   Vice President of Finance   concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of     September 30, 2016  . 

(b) Changes in internal controls 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ende  d    September 30, 2016     that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
