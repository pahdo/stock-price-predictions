Entity Names and Organization 
    
  Verso Corporation is the ultimate parent entity and the sole member of Verso Paper Finance Holdings One LLC, which is the sole member of Verso Paper Finance Holdings LLC, which is the sole member of Verso Paper Holdings LLC.  As used in this report, the term  Verso  refers to Verso Corporation; the term  Verso Finance  refers to Verso Paper Finance Holdings LLC; the term  Verso Holdings  refers to Verso Paper Holdings LLC; the term  NewPage  refers to NewPage Holdings Inc., which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Verso; the term  NewPage Corp  refers to NewPage Corporation, which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of NewPage; and the term for any such entity includes its direct and indirect subsidiaries when referring to the entity s consolidated financial condition or results.  Unless otherwise noted, references to  the Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Verso.   
    
  As previously disclosed, on January 26, 2016, or the  Petition Date,  Verso announced that Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, or collectively referred to herein as the  Debtors,  filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or the  Bankruptcy Code,  in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, or the  Bankruptcy Court.   The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration under the agreements governing all of our debt (excluding the   $23 million   loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund).  The chapter 11 cases, or the  Chapter 11 Cases,  were consolidated for procedural purposes only and administered jointly under the caption  In re: Verso Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-10163.   
    
  On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, confirming the Debtors  First Modified Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code dated as of June 20, 2016, or the  Plan.   On July 15, 2016, or the  Effective Date,  the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 Cases (see Note 2). 
    
  In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or  FASB,  Accounting Standards Codification, or  ASC  852,   Reorganizations,   the Debtors adopted fresh-start accounting upon emergence from their Chapter 11 Cases and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of July 15, 2016.  Accordingly, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the reporting entity subsequent to emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, or the  Successor,  are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements for the reporting entity prior to emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, or the  Predecessor.  
    
  Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  In this quarterly report, all statements that are not purely historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or  Securities Act,  and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or  Exchange Act.   Forward-looking statements may be identified by the words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   project,   plan,   estimate,   intend  and other similar expressions.  They include, for example, statements relating to our business and operating outlook; assessment of market conditions; and the growth potential of the industry in which we operate.  Forward-looking statements are based on currently available business, economic, financial and other information and reflect management s current beliefs, expectations and views with respect to future developments and their potential effects on us.  Actual results could vary materially depending on risks and uncertainties that may affect us and our business.   
    
  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the impact of our bankruptcy filings and the related Chapter 11 bankruptcy process on our business, financial condition or results of operations; intense competition in the paper manufacturing industry; changes in the costs of raw materials and purchased energy; developments in alternative media, which are expected to adversely affect the demand for some of our key products, and the effectiveness of our responses to these developments; rising postal costs; any additional closure and other restructuring costs; negative publicity, even if unjustified; any failure to comply with environmental or other laws or regulations, even if inadvertent; legal proceedings or disputes; any labor disputes; and the potential risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , Part II - Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and Part I, Item II,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as those discussed in Verso s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the  SEC,  from time to time.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.      SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     
  Nature of Business     We operate in the following   two   market segments: paper and pulp.  However subsequent to the Effective Date, we determined that the operating loss of the pulp segment is immaterial for disclosure purposes (see Note   13  ).  Our core business platform is as a producer of coated freesheet, specialty and coated groundwood papers.  Our products are used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines, commercial printing applications such as high-end advertising brochures, annual reports, and direct-mail advertising, and specialty applications such as flexible packaging and label and converting.  Our market kraft pulp is used to manufacture printing, writing, and specialty paper grades and tissue products. 
    
  Basis of Presentation     On January 26, 2016, Verso announced that the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code.  On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, confirming the Plan.  On July 15, 2016, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 Cases (see Note 2).   
    
  In accordance with the provisions of  ASC 852,   Reorganizations,   and     in conformity with ASC 805  , Business Combinations,   the Company adopted fresh-start accounting upon emergence from their Chapter 11 Cases and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of July 15, 2016.  For accounting purposes all emergence related transactions of the Predecessor including the impact of the issuance of the Successor common stock and warrants and entering into the Exit Credit Facilities were recorded as of July 14, 2016.  Accordingly, the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the Successor are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor. 
    
  Also in connection with the adoption of fresh-start accounting, we elected to make certain material accounting policy changes as described below.   
    
  Predecessor Planned Major Maintenance Costs     Costs for planned major maintenance shutdowns were deferred and then expensed ratably over the period until the next major planned shutdown.  Routine maintenance costs were expensed as incurred. 
    
  Successor Maintenance Costs     Costs for all repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting. The incremental costs expensed in Cost of products sold in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) related to planned major maintenance outages is approximately   $20 million  . 
    
  Successor Cost of products sold/ Selling, general and administrative expenses     Certain centralized costs attributable to manufacturing overhead recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor.  The amount recorded to Cost of products sold, related to these costs, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) is approximately   $7 million  .  
    
  This report contains the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Verso as of   September 30, 2016   (Successor), for the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015   (Predecessor), for the period from July 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), for the period from January 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), and for the period from July 15, 2016 to   September 30, 2016   (Successor).  The   December 31, 2015   (Predecessor), Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but it does not include all disclosures required annually by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or  GAAP.   In the opinion of Management, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments that are necessary for the fair presentation of Verso s respective financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  Except as disclosed in the notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.  Variable interest entities for which Verso is the primary beneficiary are consolidated (see Note 11).  Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented may not necessarily be indicative of full-year results.  It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Verso contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .

2.     BANKRUPTCY RELATED DISCLOSURES    
  Chapter 11 Filing 
  On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Filings in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration under the agreements governing all of our debt (excluding the   $23 million   loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund).  The chapter 11 cases, or the  Chapter 11 Cases,  were consolidated for procedural purposes only and administered jointly under the caption  In re: Verso Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-10163.  During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we continued to manage our properties and operated our businesses as a  debtor-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.   
  In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on January 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement, or  RSA,  with creditors who collectively held at least a majority in principal amount of substantially all tranches of the Company s outstanding debt, or the  Consenting Creditors.   The RSA contemplated the implementation of a restructuring through a conversion of approximately   $2.4 billion   of our outstanding debt into equity.  The RSA incorporated the economic terms agreed to by the parties reflected in a term sheet within the RSA.  The restructuring transactions were effectuated through the reorganization Plan as described below. 
  Verso Finance, Verso Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Verso DIP Facility for an aggregate principal amount of up to   $100 million  , and NewPage Corp and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the NewPage DIP ABL Facility (as defined in Note 7) for an aggregate principal amount of up to   $325 million   and the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility for an aggregate principal amount of   $350 million   (See Note 7).  The NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility consisted of   $175 million   of new money term loans and   $175 million   of loans that aggregated and replaced existing loans, or  NewPage DIP Roll Up Loans,  to refinance loans outstanding under the existing term loan facility of NewPage Corp that were outstanding on the Petition Date. 
  We operated in the normal course of business during the reorganization process.  Unless otherwise authorized by the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Code prohibited us from making payments to creditors for goods furnished and services provided prior to the Petition Date.  Vendors were, however, paid for goods furnished and services provided after the Petition Date in the ordinary course of business.  
  Plan of Reorganization and Emergence from Chapter 11  
    
  On March 26, 2016, the Debtors filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court together with a disclosure statement in respect of the Plan.  The Plan set forth, among other things, the treatment of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors.  On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, or the  Confirmation Order,  confirming the Plan.  On the Effective Date, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 Cases.      
  Key components of the Plan include:  
             
    Entry into an asset-based loan facility and a term loan facility upon emergence from Chapter 11 on July 15, 2016.  These facilities provided exit financing in an amount sufficient to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Verso debtor-in-possession credit agreements of Verso Holdings and its subsidiaries, pay fees and expenses related to the facilities and the emergence of Verso and its subsidiaries from bankruptcy. See  Exit Credit Facilities  below. 

The satisfaction in full in cash of claims under the Verso DIP Facility, claims under the NewPage DIP ABL Facility, claims relating to the   $175 million   of new money term loans under the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility, and claims entitled to administrative expense or priority status under the Bankruptcy Code.  

Issuance of   34,390,643   shares of stock or   100%   of Verso s equity (subject to dilution by warrants issued to certain creditors described below, or  Plan Warrants,  and equity issuable to our employees under a management incentive plan) to our existing creditors in exchange for the cancellation of all of our pre-petition indebtedness (principal and interest) existing as of the date of bankruptcy totaling   $2.6 billion  .  

11 

Lenders under the NewPage Corp senior secured term loan and the   $175 million   of  rolled up  term loans under the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility, collectively, received   15,139,745   shares of Class A Common Stock and   1,023,859   shares of Class B Common Stock or   47%   of Verso s equity.   

Holders of Verso Holdings  senior debt received   980,133   shares of Class A Common Stock or   2.85%   of Verso s equity.   

Holders of Verso Holdings  subordinated (unsecured) debt received   51,587   shares of Class A Common Stock or   0.15%   of Verso s equity.  

The satisfaction in full of general unsecured claims in an aggregate settlement totaling a fixed   $3 million   in cash (except with respect to general unsecured claims against Debtors that have only de minimis assets, which have received no distributions under the Plan).  

All shares of Verso s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled and discharged. 

The shared services agreement between Verso, NewPage and NewPage Corp was terminated. 

The prior employee incentive plans and other employment agreements were terminated and any awards issued under them were no longer honored, and a new performance incentive plan was adopted by Verso.  See  Performance Incentive Plan  below. 

Termination of the Management and Transaction Fee Agreement dated as of August 1, 2006 among Verso Paper LLC, Verso Paper Investments LP, Apollo Management V, L.P., and Apollo Management VI, L.P., and all rights and remedies thereunder were terminated, extinguished, waived and released.  

Employee retirement contracts and collective bargaining agreements were honored by the Company upon emergence. 
       
  Exit Credit Facilities  
  On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Verso Holdings entered into a   $375 million   asset-based revolving credit facility, or the  Exit ABL Facility,  and a senior secured term loan agreement that provides for term loan commitments of   $220 million   with available loan proceeds of   $198 million  , or the   Exit Term Loan Facility,  collectively termed the  Exit Credit Facilities  (See Note 7). 
     
  Registration Rights Agreement 
  On the Effective Date, and in accordance with the Plan, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with   two   of the Company s stockholders, who each owned   7%   or more of the Company s Class A Common Stock and were also holders of senior debt as of the Petition Date. Subsequent to period end, the Registration Right Agreement expired by its terms because neither stockholder notified the Company it had increased its ownership to   10%   or more of the Company s Class A Common Stock on or before October 13, 2016.  
  Plan Warrants  
  On the Effective Date, and in accordance with the Plan, warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,810,035   shares of Class A Common Stock, or  Plan Warrants,   were issued to holders of first-lien secured debt holders.  Each Plan Warrant has a   7   year term (commencing on the Effective Date) and has an initial exercise price of   $27.86   per share of Class A Common Stock.  The warrant agreement governing the Plan Warrants, or the Warrant Agreement, contains customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification, stock dividend or other distributions.  In addition, the Warrant Agreement provides for anti-dilution adjustments in the event of below market stock issuances at less than   95%   of the average closing price of the Class A Common Stock for the   10   consecutive trading days immediately prior to the applicable determination date, and for pro rata repurchases of Class A Common Stock.   
  
   12 

The fair value of the Plan Warrants was estimated on the Effective Date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used included a risk free interest rate of   1%  , an expected stock price volatility factor of   37%   and a dividend rate of   0%  . The aggregate fair value of the Plan Warrants was   $10 million   on the Effective Date. 
  Performance Incentive Plan 
  On the Effective Date, pursuant to the operation of the Plan, the Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan became effective.  The maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under this plan is   3,620,067  .  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is the administrator of the Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan. There were no stock awards issued on the Effective Date pursuant to the Plan.  
  Reporting During Bankruptcy 
  During the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases, expenses, gains and losses directly associated with reorganization proceedings were reported as Reorganization items, net in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and liabilities subject to compromise in the Chapter 11 Cases were segregated from liabilities of non-filing entities, fully secured liabilities not expected to be compromised and from post-petition liabilities.  In addition, effective as of the Petition Date and during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases,  we ceased recording contractual interest expense on the outstanding pre-petition debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise. Upon our emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, the Company settled and extinguished or reinstated liabilities that were subject to compromise. 
  Fresh-Start Accounting  
  Under ASC 852 Reorganizations, fresh-start accounting is required upon emergence from Chapter 11 if (i) the value of the assets of the emerging entity immediately before the date of confirmation is less than the total of all post-petition liabilities and allowed claims; and (ii) holders of existing voting shares immediately before confirmation receive less than 50% of the voting shares of the emerging entity. The Company qualified for and adopted fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date. Adopting fresh-start accounting results in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or deficits. The cancellation of all existing shares outstanding on the Effective Date and issuance of new shares of the reorganized entity caused a change of control of the Company under ASC 852. 
  Adoption of fresh-start accounting resulted in Verso becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes and the recording of the Company s assets and liabilities at their fair value as of the Effective Date in conformity with ASC 805,     Business Combinations. The fair values of the Company s assets and liabilities as of that date differed materially from the recorded values of its assets and liabilities as reflected in its historical consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting materially affected its results of operations following the fresh-start reporting date, as the Company had a new basis in its assets and liabilities. The Company also adopted various new accounting policies in connection with its adoption of fresh-start accounting. Consequently, the Company s financial statements on or after the Effective Date are not comparable with the financial statements prior to that date and the historical financial statements before the Effective Date are not reliable indicators of its financial condition and results of operations for any period after it adopted fresh-start accounting.  
  Reorganization Value 
    
  Reorganization value is the value attributed to an entity emerging from bankruptcy, as well as the expected net realizable value of those assets that will be disposed before emergence occurs.  This value is viewed as the value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after emergence.  Fresh-start accounting requires that the reporting entity allocate the reorganization value to its assets and liabilities in relation to their fair values upon emergence from Chapter 11. The Company s valuation of the reorganized Company dated as of   April 27, 2016  , which was included in the Disclosure Statement related to the Plan, purported the estimated enterprise value of the Company to be in a range between $  1.05 billion   and $  1.10 billion  . The estimated enterprise value, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, included the equity value in a range between   $675 million   and   $725 million  .  As part of determining the reorganization value as of July 15, 2016, the Company estimated the equity value of the Successor Company to be   $675 million   and the reorganization value to be approximately   $2 billion  . As the Company issued   100%   of its equity to existing creditors in exchange for the cancellation of all pre-petition indebtedness upon confirmation of the Plan,  the distribution of Company s equity in settlement of pre-existing indebtedness was the primary objective of the Plan. Accordingly, Verso s equity value represents the primary assumption utilized by the Company in the determination of reorganization value.  The Company believes that an equity value at the low-end of the range of   $675   -   $725   million was appropriate due to declines in projected operating performance from the submission of the Plan through the Emergence Date. 
  
   13 

In order to determine the reorganization value, Verso estimated the enterprise value of the Successor utilizing the discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis, and precedent transaction analysis. The use of each approach provides corroboration for the other approaches.   
    
  To estimate the fair value utilizing the discounted cash flow analysis, Verso established an estimate of future cash flows for the period from 2016 to 2025 and discounted the estimated future cash flows to the present value. The expected cash flows for the period 2016 to 2025 were derived from earnings forecasts and assumptions regarding growth and margin projections, as applicable, and expressed as a multiple of EBITDA (defined below). The discount rate of   9.5%   was estimated based on an after-tax weighted average cost of capital reflecting the rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. 
    
  To estimate the fair value utilizing the comparable company analysis, Verso estimated the value of the company based on a relative comparison with other publicly traded companies with similar operating and financial characteristics. Under this methodology, valuation multiples, derived from the operating data of publicly-traded benchmark companies such as the projected financial measures of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization,  or  EBITDA  were applied to projected operating data of Verso.  
    
  To estimate the fair value utilizing the precedent transaction analysis method, Verso determined an estimate of value by examining merger and acquisition transactions involving paper companies. The valuation paid in such acquisitions or implied in such mergers were analyzed as ratios of various financial results. These transaction multiples were calculated based on the purchase price (including any debt assumed) paid to acquire companies that are comparable to Verso.  
    
  The fair value of the Plan Warrants was estimated on the Effective Date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions.  The weighted average assumptions used included a risk free interest rate of   1%  , an expected stock price volatility factor of   37%   and a dividend rate of   0%  . The aggregate fair value of the Plan Warrants was determined to be    $10 million   on the Effective Date therefore the residual common stock value was determined the be   $665 million  .  
    
  The following table reconciles the equity value to the estimated reorganization value as of the Effective Date: 

The fair value and carrying value of debt represented   $318 million   of borrowings under the Exit Credit Facilities on the Effective Date. The fair value of long-term debt was determined based on a market approach utilizing market yields and was estimated to be approximately   94%   of the par value, received for (  $22 million   original issue discount on the Exit Term Loan Facility - See Note 7). 
    
  The Company s reorganization value was allocated to its assets and liabilities in conformity with ASC 805  .   The valuations of the Company s assets and liabilities in connection with fresh-start accounting include the following general valuation methodologies:  

The income approach was used to estimate value based on the present value of future economic benefits that are expected to be produced; 
                
    The market approach was used to estimate the value through the analysis of recent sales of comparable assets or business entities; 
                
    The cost approach was used to provide a systematic framework for estimating the value of tangible assets or intangible assets based on the economic principal of substitution.  
       
  The significant assumptions related to the valuation of the Company s assets are included in the footnotes to the Fresh-Start Balance sheet below. Most valuation inputs, related to inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets are  
  
   14 

considered to be Level 3 inputs as they are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. For additional information on Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs, refer to Note 4. 
    
  Reorganization Adjustments 
    
  The unaudited consolidated financial information gives effect to the following Reorganization Adjustments, the Plan and the implementation of the transactions contemplated by the Plan . These adjustments give effect to the terms of the Plan and certain underlying assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, the following:  
             
    Borrowing of   $318 million   from the Exit Credit Facilities; 
                
    Issuance of   34,390,643   shares of stock or   100%   of Verso s equity and Plan Warrants to purchase an aggregate of   1,810,035   shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for the cancellation of all of our pre-petition indebtedness existing as of the Petition Date totaling   $2.6 billion  ; 
                
    Payment for the satisfaction of general unsecured claims in aggregate settlement totaling   $3 million  ; and 
                
    Repayment of   $279 million   of liabilities under the Debtor-in-Possession credit facilities. 
       
  Fresh-Start Balance Sheet 
    
  The following fresh-start balance sheet as of the Effective Date, July 15, 2016, illustrates the financial effects on the Company of the implementation of the Plan and the adoption of fresh-start reporting. This fresh-start balance sheet reflects the effect of the completion of the transactions included in the Plan, including the issuance of successor equity and the settlement of old indebtedness.  
  Reorganization adjustments, shown in column 2 of the following schedule,  represent amounts recorded on the Effective Date for the implementation of the Plan, including the settlement of liabilities subject to comprise and related payments, the issuance of new shares of common stock and new warrants, repayment of the DIP facility and cancellation of Predecessor common stock. 
  Fresh-start adjustments, as shown in column 3 of the following schedule, represent amounts recorded on the Effective Date as a result of the adoption of fresh-start accounting, which resulted in Verso becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. The Company s assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value as of the fresh-start reporting date or Effective Date.

Debt amounts excluded related unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts/premiums, and deferred gains which were written off to Reorganization items, net, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. Amounts classified to LSTC did not include pre-petition liabilities that were fully collateralized by letters of credit or cash deposits. Borrowing under the NewPage DIP Roll-Up Notes represented borrowing during the pendency of the Company s bankruptcy and were settled in exchange for stock as described above. Both the LSTC and NewPage DIP Roll-Up Notes were resolved and satisfied as of the Effective Date.

Fresh-Start Adjustments 
  (l)  An adjustment of   $14 million   was recorded to decrease the book value of inventories to their estimated fair value as follows: 
                     Replacement parts and other supplies 
    $ 
    (52 
    ) 
      Work-in-process and finished goods 
    38 

$ 
    (14 
    ) 

The fair value of work-in-process was determined based on the estimated selling price once completed less costs to complete the manufacturing effort, costs to sell including disposal and holding period costs, and a reasonable profit margin. 
                
    The fair value of finished goods inventory was determined based on the estimated price to sell including disposal and holding period costs and a reasonable profit margin on the selling and disposal. 
                
    The fair value of replacement parts and other supplies was determined based upon the cost approach.  This approach considers the amount required to purchase a new asset of equal utility at current market prices, with adjustments in value for functional and economic obsolescence.  Functional obsolescence is the loss in value of usefulness of an asset caused by inefficiencies or inadequacies of the asset itself, when compared to a more efficient or less costly replacement parts that a new technology has developed. Economic obsolescence is the loss in value of usefulness of an  
     
   18 

asset due to factors external to the asset such as the cost of materials, related demand for the product, increased competition, and environmental regulations. 
  (m) Represents the adjustment to reduce the net book value of Property, plant, and equipment, net to fair value.  The adjustment to the fair value of Property, plant and equipment, net was attributable to an adjustment of   $392 million   to machinery and equipment and an adjustment of   $98 million   to real estate.  
  The fair value of the machinery and equipment was determined as follows:  
             
    The cost approach was utilized to determine the fair market value of machinery and equipment. This approach considers the amount required to construct or purchase a new asset of equal utility at current market prices, with adjustments in value for functional and economic obsolescence. Functional obsolescence is the loss in value of usefulness of an asset caused by inefficiencies or inadequacies of the property itself, when compared to a more efficient or less costly replacement property that a new technology has developed. Economic obsolescence is the loss in value of usefulness of an asset due to factors external to the asset such as the cost of materials, related demand for the product, increased competition, and environmental regulations. 
                
    The sales approach was also used to determine the fair market value of machinery and equipment. The principal behind this approach is that the value of the asset is equal to the market price of an asset with comparable features such as design, location, size, construction materials, use, capacity, specifications, operational characteristics, technology level, accessories and other features that may impact value or marketability.  
                
    The income approach was also used to determine the fair market value of machinery and equipment. The principal behind this approach is that the value of the asset is equal to the earnings potential of the assets such as the net rental savings attributable to owning the asset.  
     The adjustment related to real estate fair value was determined as follows:  
             
    The market approach was utilized to determine the fair market value of real estate. This approach considers comparable land sale data and land held for sale. Variances in market conditions at the time of sale, property characteristics, and other relevant factors were considered and analyzed when necessary. 
                
    Land and building improvements were valued utilized using the cost approach which considers the replacement cost of the improvement.  
     (n) An adjustment of   $30 million   was recorded to decrease the book value to fair value of Intangible and Other Assets to estimated fair value as follows:  
                     Successor Trade Names 
    $ 
    16

See Note 6, Intangibles and Other Assets, for further discussion of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of intangible assets.   
  (o) Represents an adjustment to the fair value of pension and postretirement obligations totaling   $135 million  , off-set by the write-off of   $8 million   of tax liabilities resulting from the Reorganization Adjustments, and other adjustments to asset retirement obligations (See Note 4) and workers  compensation reserves. Refer to Note 8, Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information.

Contractual Interest 
    
  Effective January 26, 2016, we discontinued recording interest expense on outstanding pre-petition debt classified as LSTC.  The table below shows contractual interest amounts for debt classified as LSTC calculated in accordance with the respective agreements without giving effect to any penalties as a result of the default on such agreements, which are amounts due under the contractual terms of the outstanding debt.  Interest expense reported in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the periods after the Effective Date does not include   $10 million   and   $123 million  , per the table below, in contractual interest on pre-petition debt classified as LSTC, which was stayed by the Bankruptcy Court effective on the Petition Date.  

Reorganization items, net   
    
  Expenses and income directly associated with the Chapter 11 Cases are reported separately in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as Reorganization items, net as required by ASC 852.  Reorganization items, net include adjustments to reflect the carrying value of LSTC at their estimated allowed claim amounts, as such adjustments are determined.  The following table presents reorganization items incurred in the the periods after the Effective Date, as reported in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: 

20 

(1) Primarily represents   $116 million   of non-cash reorganization gain off-set by non-cash reorganization expense of   $35 million  . The gains are recognized as the difference between the Petition Date carrying value of certain Verso notes previously recorded as a troubled debt restructuring and their par value (estimated allowed claim) for such debt and the expenses represent the write-off of debt issuance costs and other carrying value adjustments.  
    
  For the period from January 26, 2016 through July 14, 2016, the cash used in reorganization items included approximately   $28 million   of professional fees and   $22 million   of DIP financing costs. For the period from July 15, 2016 through September 30, 2016, cash used in reorganization items included approximately   $18 million   for professional fees. The cash outflow is included in Net cash provided by operating activities in our  Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented. 
  Pre-Petition Claims  
    
  Holders of the substantial majority of pre-petition claims were required to file proofs of claims by the bar date established by the Bankruptcy Court.  A bar date is the date by which certain claims against the Debtors must be filed if the claimants wish to receive any distribution in the Chapter 11 Cases.  The Bankruptcy Court established a bar date of April 29, 2016 for the substantial majority of claims.  The government bar date was July 25, 2016.   
  As of October 24, 2016, we have received approximately   3,700   filed claims.  The filed claims aggregate to approximately   $19 billion  .  We have reconciled the majority of these claims to the amounts listed in our schedules of assets and liabilities.  We have also requested the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that we believe are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated, or should be disallowed for other reasons.  To the extent claims are reconciled and settled/resolved, we have recorded them at the expected allowed amount. Claims that remain unresolved through the filing of this report have been estimated based upon management s best estimate of the likely claim amounts that the Bankruptcy Court will ultimately allow. 
  Given the substantial number of claims filed, the claims resolution process will continue even though we have emerged from Chapter 11.  Differences between liability amounts recorded by the Debtors as liabilities subject to compromise and claims filed by creditors are investigated, and the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowable claim, if needed.  Differences between those final allowed claims and the liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were recognized as reorganization items in our statements of consolidated income (loss) of the Predecessor as they were resolved.  The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be resolved cannot be made until a court-approved order related to settlement of specific liabilities becomes effective.  Accordingly, the ultimate amount or resolution of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. 
  The Company satisfied general unsecured claims in an aggregate settlement amount totaling   $3 million   which was capped by the Plan and fully funded on the date of emergence. 
  Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases  
    
  Under the Bankruptcy Code, we had the right to assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and other conditions. We and our counter parties had up to 120 days from bankruptcy emergence to accept or reject the terms of executory contracts or unexpired leases. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires a debtor to satisfy pre-petition obligations under contracts, which may include payment of pre-petition liabilities in whole or in part.  Rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is typically  
  
   21 

treated as a breach occurring as of the moment immediately preceding the Chapter 11 filing.  Subject to certain exceptions, this rejection relieves the debtor from performing its future obligations under the contract but entitles the counterparty to assert a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages.  Parties to executory contracts or unexpired leases rejected by a debtor may file proofs of claims against that debtor s estate for rejection damages.  
  Since the Petition Date, we have renegotiated or rejected a limited number of executory contracts and unexpired leases.  
  There were no material changes to contractual obligations previously included in our 10-K except as generated by our cancellation of debt described above and in Note 7. 
  Common Stock Privileges 
  The   33,366,784   shares of Class A Common stock and   1,023,859   shares of Class B Common Stock issued in connection with the cancellation of all of the Company s pre-petition indebtedness are identical and entitle the holders thereof the same rights and privileges, except that the Class B Common Stock is not qualified for listing and trading on the NYSE.  One share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company.  

3.      RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS    
    
  Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2016 
    
  ASC Topic 323, Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures.    In March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or  ASU,  2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  , changes the requirements for equity method accounting when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the investor s ownership interest in or degree of influence over an investee.  The guidance (i) eliminates the need to retroactively apply the equity method of accounting upon qualifying for such treatment, (ii) requires that the cost of acquiring the additional interest in an investee be added to the basis of the previously held interest and (iii) requires that unrealized holding gains or losses for available-for-sale equity securities that qualify for the equity method of accounting be recognized in earnings at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method of accounting.  The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and it did not impact our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations  .  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  . This guidance eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  The acquirer must record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and it did not impact our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 810, Consolidation.    In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation  , which amends the requirements for consolidation and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years.  The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and it did not impact our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  
    
  ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This standard provides specific guidance on eight cash flow issues to reduce the current diversity in practice.  These issues are Debt prepayment or debt costs, Settlement of zero-coupon debt, Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, Distributions received from equity method investees, Beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  .  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The update will improve implementation of Topic 606 by adding clarity to the objective of the collectability criterion, recognition  method when the collectability criteria is not met, and the presentation of sales taxes collected from customers. This ASU has the same effective date as ASU 2014-09. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  . The update rescinds certain SEC guidance from FASB ASC pursuant to the SEC Staff s Announcements on March 3, 2016. Specifically, the update supersedes SEC observer comments related to revenue and expense recognition for freight services, shipping and handling fees, consideration given by a vendor to a customer, and accounting for gas-balancing arrangements. Additionally the update supersedes SEC observer comments related to determining the host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument. This ASU has the same effective dates as ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2014-16. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers     (Topic 606)  . The update does not change the core guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in the update clarify the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09 discussed below. Additionally, this ASU improves guidance within Topic 606 related to the implementation of licensing revenue recognition. This ASU has the same effective date as ASU 2014-09. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  It amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the ASU 2014-09.  It clarifies that an entity should determine whether it is a principal or an agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer.  Thus, in a contract involving more than one specified good or service, the entity could be a principal for some specified goods or services and an agent for others. This ASU has the same effective date as the ASU 2014-09.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    This guidance will replace all current GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance.  The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This guidance was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption; however, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date,   which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This standard provides for several changes to the accounting for share-based awards.  Among other changes, this standard will require recognition of certain income tax effects of awards in net income in the period in which the awards are settled or vested, rather than through additional paid-in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet.  The standard also changes the presentation of excess tax benefits and statutory tax withholdings in the statement of cash flows.  This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2017; however, early adoption is permitted.  Each of the various provisions within this standard has its own specified transition method; some will be applied prospectively and others will be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 842, Leases.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  This standard requires all leases that have a term of over 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet with the liability for lease payments and the corresponding right-of-use asset initially measured at the present value of amounts expected to be paid over the term. Recognition of the costs of these leases on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification as either an operating or a financing lease.  Costs of an operating lease will continue to be recognized as a single operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Costs for a financing lease will be disaggregated and recognized as both an operating expense (for the amortization of the right-of-use asset) and interest expense (for interest on the lease liability).  This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments.   In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   Under this standard, all equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method are required to be measured at fair value.  Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may, as a practical expedient, be measured at cost, adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment.  This standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018.  This standard must be applied using a cumulative-effect adjustment in net income to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, except for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, which are to be applied prospectively to equity investments as of the adoption date. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 330, Inventory  .      In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.    This ASU provides that entities should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  ASC Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern.    In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    This ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the potential impact of this standard on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after   September 30, 2016  , are not expected to have a significant effect on our 
   Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

4.      SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION    
    
  Earnings Per Share         Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, after giving effect to potentially dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common share equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if they are anti-dilutive. 

24 

The following table provides a reconciliation of basic and diluted loss per common share: 

In accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings Per Share  , unvested restricted stock awards issued by Verso contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends and qualify as participating securities.  On the Effective Date, all issued and outstanding shares of Verso s old common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, including all restricted stock awards and stock options to purchase shares of Verso s old common stock, were canceled and extinguished.  See Note 2 for additional information.  No dividends have been declared or paid in   2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Inventories and Replacement Parts and Other Supplies         Inventory values include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead, and these values are presented at the lower of cost or market.  Costs of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods are determined using the first-in, first-out method.   
    
  Replacement parts and other supplies of the Successor are stated using the average cost method and are reflected in Inventories on the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, while replacement parts and other supplies of the Predecessor were reflected in Inventories and Intangibles and other assets, net, on the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note   6  ).

The following table summarizes inventories by major category:   

Asset Retirement Obligations         In accordance with ASC Topic 410,     Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations  ,   a liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long-lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists.  The liability is accreted over time and the asset is depreciated over its useful life.  Our asset retirement obligations under this standard relate primarily to closure and post-closure costs for landfills. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated costs or timing of closure or possible new federal or state regulations affecting the closure.  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $1 million   of restricted cash was included in Intangibles and other assets, net in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to asset retirement obligations in the state of Michigan.  These cash deposits are required by the state and may only be used for the future closure of a landfill. 
    
  The following table presents activity related to our asset retirement obligations.  Long-term obligations are included in Other liabilities and current portions are included in Accrued liabilities in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:

The increase in the liability for the period ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to the assumption of the asset retirement obligation liabilities associated with landfills acquired in connection with the NewPage acquisition.  The decrease in the liability for the period ended July 14, 2016 was attributable to reassessing the estimated discounted closure costs of certain long-lived assets as we adopted fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date.  There were no material activities in the Successor period from July 15 through September 30, 2016. 
    
  In addition to the above obligations, we may be required to remove certain materials from our facilities or to remediate them in accordance with current regulations that govern the handling of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials.  At this time, any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date, and we believe that adequate information does not exist to reasonably estimate any such potential obligations.  Accordingly, no liability for such remediation was recorded. 
    
  Property, Plant, and Equipment         Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Interest is capitalized on projects meeting certain criteria and is included in the cost of the assets.  The capitalized interest is depreciated over the same useful lives as the related assets.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the assets  estimated useful lives.  In connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting, the net book values of property, plant, and equipment were reduced to their estimated fair values by   $490 million   (see Note 2). 

26 

Interest costs capitalized and depreciation expense for the periods presented are as follows:  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments     The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.  We determine the fair value of our debt based on market information and a review of prices and terms available for similar obligations.  See also Note 2, Note 6, and Note 7 for additional information regarding the fair value of financial instruments. 
    
  We use fair value measurements for the initial recording of certain assets and liabilities, periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities, and disclosures.  Fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 
    
  The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions used to value the assets or liabilities.  Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.  The three levels are defined as follows: 
                    Level 1: 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
         Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1.  For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. 
         Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumption about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

5.      ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS    
    
  Sale of hydroelectric generation facilities     On January 6, 2016, Verso Maine Power Holdings LLC, or  VMPH,  and Verso Androscoggin Power LLC, or  VAP,    two   indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of Verso, entered into a purchase agreement with Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, LLC, or  Eagle Creek,  pursuant to which VMPH sold all the outstanding limited liability company interests of VAP to Eagle Creek for a purchase price of approximately   $62 million   in cash.  VAP owned   four   hydroelectric generation facilities associated with Verso s Androscoggin pulp and paper mill located in Jay, Maine.  The purchase agreement contains customary representations and warranties by, and customary covenants among, the parties.  The parties contemporaneously entered into the purchase agreement and consummated the transaction.  As of December 31, 2015 (Predecessor), we classified the hydroelectric generation facilities as held for sale on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  For the period from January 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), we recognized a gain on sale of fixed assets of approximately   $55 million   which is included in Other operating income in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Sale of Bucksport Mill           On January 29, 2015, Verso consummated a sale of equity interests in Verso subsidiaries that owned 
  the Bucksport mill and related assets to AIM Development (USA) LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of American Iron 
    Metal Company Inc., or  AIM.  
  
   27 

NewPage Acquisition       On January 3, 2014, Verso, Verso Merger Sub Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso, or  Merger Sub,  and NewPage entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the  Merger Agreement,  pursuant to which the parties agreed to merge Merger Sub with and into NewPage on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, with NewPage surviving the merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Verso.  On January 7, 2015, Verso consummated the NewPage acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement.  As a result of the merger, NewPage became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Verso Holdings.  Verso incurred transaction and integration costs related to the NewPage acquisition during the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015   (Predecessor) of   $7 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, which were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  As consideration for the NewPage acquisition, Verso issued (a)   $650 million   aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes and (b)     13,607,693   shares of Verso common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares of common stock of NewPage.  Also, as of the date that NewPage became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso, NewPage had an existing   $750 million   NewPage Term Loan Facility and   $350 million   NewPage ABL Facility, of which   $734 million   and   $100 million  , respectively, were outstanding.  As a condition of allowing the acquisition to proceed, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a settlement with Verso and NewPage that required NewPage to divest its paper mills in Biron, Wisconsin, and Rumford, Maine, which occurred prior to the acquisition of NewPage. 
    
  Accounting consideration for the NewPage acquisition was as follows:    

The allocation of the purchase price was as follows:  

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents results as if the NewPage acquisition and the related financing had occurred on January 1, 2014.  The historical consolidated financial information of Verso and NewPage were adjusted in the pro forma information to give effect to pro forma events that were directly attributable to the transactions and factually supportable.  As NewPage s divestiture of its paper mills in Biron, Wisconsin, and Rumford, Maine, occurred prior to the acquisition of NewPage, their historical results were excluded from the pro forma results below. 
  The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect events that have occurred or may occur after the transactions, including the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings from operating efficiencies, or any revenue, tax, or other synergies expected to result from the NewPage acquisition.  Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transactions been effected on the assumed date, nor is it necessarily an indication of future operating results. 
  
   28 

In addition, the NewPage acquisition did not result in a taxable transaction and Verso had net operating loss carryforwards and a related full valuation allowance that were expected to offset any deferred tax impact of the NewPage acquisition.  Further, as the sale of the Bucksport mill was not directly attributable to the NewPage acquisition, no pro forma adjustments for the Bucksport sale have been made.

6.      INTANGIBLES AND OTHER ASSETS    
    
  The following table summarizes intangibles and other assets: 

As part of fresh-start accounting, we wrote-off the existing intangible assets and accumulated amortization of the Predecessor and recorded an adjustment of   $30 million   to reflect the fair value of the Intangible and other assets of the Successor (see also Note 2).  The intangible assets of the Successor are comprised of customer relationships with a useful life of   10 years   and trademarks with a   5   year useful life.  Both are amortized on a straight-line basis.  The fair value of trademarks was determined based on the Relief from Royalty method.  We assumed a royalty rate of    0.25%   and a   five   year economic life for our trademarks. The rate was based on analysis of market information. 
  
   29 

Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the periods presented is as follows: 

The estimated future amortization expense for our intangible assets over the next five years is as follows:

7.      DEBT    
    
  A summary of debt is as follows: 

We determine the fair value of our long-term debt based on market information and a review of prices and terms available for similar obligations.  Our debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy (see Note 4).  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of Verso s borrowing facilities was   $320 million  . 
    
  Amounts included in interest expense and amounts of cash interest payments related to long-term debt for the periods presented, are as follows: 

Exit Credit Facilities  
  On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of Plan, Verso Holdings entered into a   $375 million   asset-based revolving credit facility, or the  Exit ABL Facility,  and a senior secured term loan agreement that provided for term loan commitments of   $220 million   with available loan proceeds of   $198 million  , or the   Exit Term Loan Facility,  collectively termed the  Exit Credit Facilities.   
     
  Verso Holdings borrowed   $340 million   under the Exit Credit Facilities on the Effective Date, with available loan proceeds of approximately   $318 million  , consisting of (i) the borrowing of   $120 million   under the Exit ABL Facility and (ii) the net borrowing of   $198 million   (  $220 million   par value less   $22 million   of  original issue discount) under the Exit Term Loan Facility.  The proceeds of the borrowings on the Effective Date under the Exit Credit Facilities were used (i) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the debtor-in-possession financing credit agreements, (ii) to pay outstanding allowed administrative expenses and allowed claims in accordance with the Plan, and (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to and contemplated by the Exit Credit Facilities and emergence by Verso and its subsidiaries from bankruptcy.  The proceeds of the borrowings under the Exit ABL Facility after the Effective Date will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.  

31 

The Exit ABL Facility will mature on   July 14, 2021  .  The outstanding borrowings under the Exit ABL Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the option of Verso Holdings, either (i) a customary London interbank offered rate, or  LIBOR,  plus an applicable margin ranging from   1.25%   to   2.00%   or (ii) a customary base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   0.25%   to   1.00%  , determined based upon the average excess availability under the Exit ABL Facility.  Verso Holdings is also required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Exit ABL Facility, which ranges from   0.25%   to   0.375%   per annum, based upon the average revolver usage under the Exit ABL Facility.  Verso Holdings has the right to prepay loans under the Exit ABL Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty, other than customary  breakage  costs with respect to eurocurrency loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the Exit ABL Facility is   $116 million  , with $  82 million   in letters of credit issued, and   $170 million   available for future borrowings.   
  The Exit Term Loan Facility will mature on   October 14, 2021  .The outstanding borrowings under the Exit Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of Verso Holdings, either (i) a LIBOR (subject to a floor of   1%  ) plus   11%   or (ii) a customary base rate plus   10%  .  With respect to LIBOR denominated loans under the Exit Credit Facilities, Verso Holdings may elect an interest period of one, two, three or six months or such other period subject to the terms of the Exit Credit Facilities.  The term loans provided under the Exit Term Loan Facility are subject to quarterly principal amortization payments in an amount equal to the greater of (a)   2.00%   of the initial principal amount of the term loans or (b) the excess cash flow in respect of such quarter as further described under the Exit Term Loan Facility; however, if the liquidity, as defined in the Exit Term Loan Facility, of Verso Holdings is less than   $75 million   at any time during the 90-day period following the due date of such quarterly amortization payment or excess cash flow payment date, then the portion of such amortization amount that results in such liquidity being less than   $75 million   will not be payable by Verso Holdings, as further described in the Exit Term Loan Facility.  Per the described quarterly principal amortization, installments due are at least   $4 million   (subject to increase depending on excess cash flow) for each quarter ending in 2016 through 2021 with the remaining balance due on   October 14, 2021  .   Any voluntary prepayment by Verso Holdings of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility will be subject to customary  breakage  costs with respect to eurocurrency loans and a   2%   call premium until July 14, 2018, and a   1%   call premium after July 15, 2018, but before July 14, 2020, and thereafter no call premium will apply to any voluntary prepayment of term loans.  Such call premium may also apply to certain repricing amendments of the Term Loan Facility as further described therein. 
  All obligations under the Exit Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Verso Finance, and certain of the subsidiaries of Verso Holdings and are secured by liens on certain assets of Verso Finance and liens on substantially all of the assets of Verso Holdings and the other guarantor subsidiaries.  The security interest with respect to the Exit ABL Facility consists of a first-priority lien on the current assets of Verso Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries, including accounts receivables, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodities accounts, and a second-priority lien on all other collateral.  The security interest with respect to the Exit Term Loan Facility, consists of a first-priority lien on all other collateral and second-priority lien on collateral securing the Exit ABL Facility. 
  The Exit ABL Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company, among other things, to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances and a maximum total net leverage ratio.  The Exit Credit Facilities also contain restrictions, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, on the Company s ability to incur debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interest, prepay indebtedness, sell or dispose of assets, and make investments in or merge with another company.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants in our Exit Financing Agreements  .

  The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases by the Debtors on January 26, 2016 constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration under the agreements governing all of our debt (excluding the   $23 million   loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund).  As of the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, approximately   $2.5 billion   of debt and interest were outstanding under the Predecessor s prepetition credit agreements, excluding related unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts/premiums, and deferred gains which were written off to Reorganization items, net upon filing the Chapter 11 Cases.  All of the Predecessor s prepetition debt and interest were cancelled in exchange for the issuance of   34,390,643   of stock or 100% of the Company s equity. 
    
  DIP Financing 
    
  In connection with the Chapter 11 Filings, Verso Finance, Verso Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an asset-based credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $100 million  , or the  Verso DIP Facility,  and NewPage Corp  
  
   32 

and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an asset-based credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $325 million  , or the  NewPage DIP ABL Facility,  and a term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $350 million  , or the  NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility,  together with the NewPage DIP ABL Facility, the  NewPage DIP Facilities,  and the NewPage DIP Facilities together with the Verso DIP Facility, the  DIP Facilities.   The NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility consisted of   $175 million   of new money term loans and   $175 million   of loans that aggregated and replaced existing loans outstanding on the Petition Date (i.e., such loans were deemed to become loans under the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility), or  NewPage DIP Roll Up Loans.   On January 28, 2016, up to   $550 million   in loans under the DIP Facilities became available for borrowing following the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Facilities on an interim basis on January 27, 2016.  The Bankruptcy Court entered orders approving the DIP Facilities on a final basis on March 2, 2016.  
    
  Borrowings under the Verso DIP Facility bore interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at Verso Holdings  and NewPage Corp s option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the U.S. federal funds rate plus   0.50%  , (2) the prime rate of the administrative agent, and (3) the adjusted LIBOR (as defined below) for a one-month interest period plus   1.00%  , or (b) a eurocurrency rate, or  LIBOR  determined by reference to the costs of funds for eurocurrency deposits in dollars in the London interbank market for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs.  The applicable margin for advances under both the Verso DIP Facility and the NewPage DIP ABL was   1.50%   for base rate advances and   2.50%   for LIBOR advances.  The applicable margin for advances under the NewPage DIP Term Loan  Facility was   8.50%   for base rate advances and   9.50%   for LIBOR advances. Interest that accrued on any  rolled-up  term loans under the NewPage DIP Term Loan  Facility was capitalized, compounded and added to the unpaid principal amount of such  rolled-up  loans on the applicable interest payment date.  Verso Holdings and NewPage Corp paid commitment fees for the unused amount of commitments at an annual rate equal to   0.75%   and   0.375%  , respectively.  
    
  The DIP Facilities matured on the Effective Date of the Plan.  On the maturity date, the Verso DIP Facility had   no   balance outstanding and the NewPage DIP ABL Facility had   $103 million   outstanding balance which was repaid in full using the Exit Credit Facilities entered into on the Effective Date.  The NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility of   $175 million   of new money term loans was also repaid in full, while the   $175 million   of  rolled up  loans and its capitalized interests of   $9 million  , totaling to   $184 million  , were converted into Verso equity (see Note 2).     

8.      RETIREMENT AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS     
    
  We maintain various defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for certain current and former hourly employees.  The pension plans provide defined benefits based on years of service multiplied by a flat monetary benefit or based on a percentage of compensation as defined by the respective plan document.  Since the completion of the NewPage acquisition, we have maintained three additional plans: a cash balance defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees, a defined benefit pension plan for union hourly employees, and a plan covering other postretirement and post-employment benefits, or  OPEB,  for certain employees.  All of our defined benefit pension plans are frozen to new entrants.  Further, all of our pension plans are frozen to new benefit accruals, with the exception of the NewPage union hourly plan which continues to provide service accruals toward their pension benefits but no longer provides multiplier increases.  The cash balance plan participants continue to earn annual interest credits, but no longer earn cash balance benefit credits. 
    
  The following tables summarize the components of net periodic benefit cost of our pension plans for the periods presented: 

33 

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost that are amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss and into Net periodic pension cost are classified into Cost of products sold on our accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
    
  We make contributions that are sufficient to fully fund our actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or  ERISA.   For the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015   (Predecessor), we made contributions to the pension plans of approximately   $10 million   and   $23 million  , respectively.  For the periods from July 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor) and January 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), we made contributions of approximately   $6 million   and   $16 million  , respectively.  For the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor), we made contributions of approximately   $3 million  . We expect to make cash contributions of approximately   $6 million   to the pension plans in the remainder of   2016  .  
    
  Our OPEB obligations provide other retirement and post-employment benefits for certain employees, which may include healthcare benefits for certain retirees prior to their reaching age 65, healthcare benefits for certain retirees on and after their reaching age 65, long-term disability benefits, continued group life insurance and extended health and dental benefits.  These benefits are provided through various employer- and/or employee-funded postretirement benefit plans.   
    
  The following tables summarize the components of net periodic cots of our OPEB obligations for the periods presented: 

As described in Note 2, employee retirement contracts and collective bargaining agreements were honored by the Company after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases on the Effective Date.  
    
  Upon the adoption of fresh-start accounting, we were required to remeasure our obligations under our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.  The remeasurement increased our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by   $135 million   and was driven primarily by a change in the discount rate (also see Note 2).  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we made the decision to eliminate the post-employment benefits of certain retirees not covered by the current collective bargaining agreements effective January 1, 2017.

9.     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
    
  Management Agreement     In connection with the acquisition of our business from International Paper Company on August 1, 2006, we entered into a management agreement with certain affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC, or  Apollo,  our then majority owner, relating to the provision of certain financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services, which was scheduled to expire on   August 1, 2018  .  Under the management agreement, Apollo, upon providing notice to us, had the right to act, in return for additional fees to be mutually agreed by the parties to the management agreement, as our financial advisor or investment banker for any merger, acquisition, disposition, financing or similar transaction if we decided to engage someone to fill such role.  If Apollo exercised its right to act as our financial advisor or investment banker for any such transaction, and if we were unable to agree with Apollo on its compensation for serving in such role, then at the closing of any merger, acquisition, disposition or financing or similar transaction, we agreed to pay Apollo a fee equal to   1%   of the aggregate enterprise value (including the aggregate value of equity securities, warrants, rights and options acquired or retained; indebtedness acquired, assumed or refinanced; and any other consideration or compensation paid in connection with such transaction).  We also agreed to indemnify Apollo and its affiliates and their directors, officers and representatives for losses relating to the services contemplated by the management agreement and the engagement of affiliates of Apollo pursuant to, and the performance by them of the services contemplated by, the management agreement.  Apollo did not exercise its right to act as our financial advisor or investment banker for any such transaction in the periods presented and thus, we made   no   payment to Apollo under the management agreement during those periods.  On the Effective Date, in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, such management agreement was terminated and all rights and remedies thereunder were terminated, extinguished, waived and released.    
    
  Transactions with Affiliates         Prior to the Effective Date, we transacted business with affiliates of Apollo from time to time.  Our product sales to Apollo affiliates were approximately     $11 million   and   $23 million   for the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015   (Predecessor). Our related accounts receivable were approximately   $1 million   as of December 31, 2015 (Predecessor).  Our product purchases from Apollo affiliates were negligible for the Predecessor.  As of the Effective date, Apollo is no longer a related party. 
    
  For the period from July 15 to September 30, 2016 (Successor), we did not transact business with affiliates, however upon the Effective Date, several of our significant shareholders became our debt holders. 

10.     RESTRUCTURING CHARGES    
  Bucksport Mill Closure         On October 1, 2014, Verso announced plans to close our paper mill in Bucksport, Maine, and we ceased paper manufacturing operations in December 2014.  The mill closure reduced Verso s coated groundwood paper production capacity by approximately   350,000   tons and its specialty paper production capacity by approximately   55,000   tons.  In January 2015, Verso consummated the sale of the Bucksport mill and related assets (see Note 5). 
  The following table details the charges incurred related primarily to the Bucksport mill closure in 2014 and attributable to the paper segment as included in Restructuring charges on our accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:   

   There were   no   restructuring charges related to the Bucksport shutdown during 2016. 
    
  NewPage Acquisition Restructuring         As part of the NewPage acquisition, Verso executed a restructuring of its operations to integrate the historical Verso and NewPage operations, generate cost savings and capture synergies across the combined company.   

35 

The following table details the charges incurred related primarily to the NewPage acquisition and primarily attributable to the paper segment as included in Restructuring charges on our accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations: 

There were   no   restructuring charges related to the NewPage acquisition during 2016. 
    
  The following details the changes in our restructuring reserve liabilities related to the NewPage acquisition during the period January 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor) and the period July 15, 2016 to   September 30, 2016   (Successor), which are included in Accrued liabilities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

Androscoggin/Wickliffe Capacity Reductions         On August 20, 2015, Verso announced plans to make production capacity reductions at   two   of our mills by shutting down the No. 1 pulp dryer and No. 2 paper machine at our mill in Androscoggin, Maine, and by indefinitely idling our mill in Wickliffe, Kentucky.  Together, these actions will reduce our production capacity by   430,000   tons of coated paper and   130,000   tons of dried market pulp.  On April 5, 2016, we announced our decision to permanently close the Wickliffe mill and the associated Property, plant, and equipment were written down to salvage value.   
  The following table details the charges incurred related primarily to the   Androscoggin/Wickliffe Capacity Reductions   and primarily attributable to the paper segment as included in Restructuring charges on our accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Predecessor:

The following details the changes in our restructuring reserve liabilities related to the   Androscoggin/Wickliffe Capacity Reductions   during the period January 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor) and the period July 15, 2016 to   September 30, 2016   (Successor), which are included in Accrued liabilities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: 

On November 1, 2016, we announced the temporary idling of the No. 3 paper machine at our Androscoggin mill. 

11.     NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT ENTITIES    
    
  In 2010, Verso Quinnesec REP LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Verso Holdings, entered into a financing transaction with Chase Community Equity, LLC, or  Chase,  related to renewable energy project whose original cost was   $43 million   at our mill in Quinnesec, Michigan, in which Chase made a capital contribution and Verso Finance made a loan to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund, LLC, or the  Investment Fund,  under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit, or  NMTC,  program, provided for in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000.   
    
  By virtue of its contribution, Chase is entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the NMTCs.  This transaction also includes a put/call provision whereby we may be obligated or entitled to repurchase Chase s interest.  We believe that Chase will exercise the put option in December 2017 at the end of the recapture period.  The value attributed to the put/call is de minimis.  The NMTC is subject to   100%   recapture for a period of   7 years   as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.  We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangement.  Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, could require us to indemnify Chase for any loss or recapture of NMTCs related to the financing until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved.  We do not anticipate any credit recaptures will be required in connection with this arrangement. 
    
  We have determined that the Investment Fund is a variable interest entity, or  VIE,  of which we are the primary beneficiary, and have consolidated it in accordance with the accounting standard for consolidation.  Chase s contribution, net of syndication fees, is included in Other liabilities in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Direct costs incurred in structuring the financing arrangement are deferred and will be recognized as expense over the term of the loans.  Incremental costs to maintain the structure during the compliance period are recognized as incurred. 

37 

The following table summarizes the impact of the consolidated VIE as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  :

12.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
    
  Expera Specialty Solutions          We were a party to a long-term supply agreement with Expera Specialty Solutions, or  Expera,  for the manufacture of specialty paper products on paper machine no. 5 at our Androscoggin mill in Jay, Maine.  The agreement, which was an element of the sale by International Paper Company of its industrial paper business to Thilmany, LLC in 2005, had a   12  -year term expiring on   June 1, 2017  .  Verso, as the assignee of International Paper, was responsible for the machine s routine maintenance and Expera was responsible for any capital expenditures specific to the machine.  The agreement required Expera to pay us a variable charge for the paper purchased and a fixed charge for the availability of the paper machine.  Expera had the right to terminate the agreement if certain events occurred. 
    
  On May 25, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court authorized Verso to reject its supply agreement with Expera effective on May 4, 2016.  Moving forward from the rejection of this agreement, we intend to continue producing on paper machine no. 5 at our Androscoggin mill for our own account a portfolio of specialty paper products.  
    
  General Litigation         We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business.  We do not believe that any liability that may result from these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

13.     INFORMATION BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT    
    
  We have   two   operating segments, paper and pulp, however, subsequent to the Effective Date, we have determined that the operating loss of the pulp segment is immaterial for disclosure purposes.  Our paper products are used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines, and commercial printing applications such as high-end advertising brochures, annual reports, and direct-mail advertising.  Our market kraft pulp is used to manufacture printing, writing, and specialty paper grades and tissue products.  Our assets are utilized across segments in our integrated mill system and are not identified by segment or reviewed by management on a segment basis.  We operate primarily in one geographic segment, North America.   
  
   38 

The following table summarizes the industry segment data for the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015  , and for the periods from July 1 to July 14, 2016 and January 1 to July 14, 2016: 

(1) Operating losses  in the period from January 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016, include   $135 million   of Restructuring charges attributable to the paper segment and   $16 million   of Restructuring charges related to the pulp segment.  For the   three-month and nine-month periods   ended   September 30, 2015  , Restructuring charges attributable to the paper segment were   $49 million   and   $75 million  , respectively.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are the leading North American producer of coated papers, which are used primarily in magazines, catalogs, high-end advertising brochures and annual reports, among other media and marketing publications.      We produce a wide range of products, ranging from coated freesheet and coated groundwood, to inkjet and digital paper, supercalendered papers, and uncoated freesheet.  We also produce and sell market kraft pulp, which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products. 
    
  Headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, with a business center in Miamisburg, Ohio, Verso operates   seven   mills strategically located in Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin with a total annual paper production capacity of approximately   3.2 million   tons of paper. 
    
  Recent Developments 
    
  Emergence from Chapter 11  
    
  On January 26, 2016, or the  Petition Date,  we and substantially all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, collectively, the  Debtors,  filed voluntary petitions for relief, or the  Chapter 11 Filings,  under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or the  Bankruptcy Code,  in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the  Bankruptcy Court.  The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration under the agreements governing all of our debt (excluding the $23 million loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund).  The chapter 11  
  
   39 

cases, or the  Chapter 11 Cases,  were consolidated for procedural purposes only and administered jointly under the caption  In re: Verso Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-10163.   During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we continued to manage our properties and operate our businesses as a  debtor-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.   
  In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, Verso Finance, Verso Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Verso DIP Facility for an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, and NewPage Corp and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the NewPage DIP ABL Facility for an aggregate principal amount of up to $325 million and the NewPage Term Loan DIP Facility for an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (see Note 7).  The NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility consisted of $175 million of new money term loans and $175 million of roll up loans refinancing loans outstanding under the existing term loan facility of NewPage Corp outstanding on the Petition Date.  The Verso DIP Facility, NewPage DIP ABL Facility and NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility are collectively referred to as the  DIP Facilities . 
  On March 26, 2016, the Debtors filed a proposed joint plan of reorganization, (as amended, the  Plan, ) with the Bankruptcy Court together with a disclosure statement in respect of the Plan.  The Plan set forth, among other things, the treatment of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors.  On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, or the  Confirmation Order,  confirming the Plan.  On July 15, 2016, or the  Effective Date,  the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 Cases.  
  On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, among other things: 
             
    Verso issued 33,366,784 shares of its new Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or  Class A Common Stock,  1,023,859 shares of its new Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or  Class B Common Stock,  and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,810,035 shares of Class A Common Stock, or  Plan Warrants,  in exchange for the elimination of  $2.6 billion of the Debtor s outstanding indebtedness (principal and accrued interest); 
                
    The satisfaction in full of general unsecured claims in aggregate settlement totaling   $3 million   in cash (except with respect to general unsecured claims against Debtors that have only de minimis assets, which will receive no distributions under the Plan); 
                
    All shares of Verso s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled and discharged;  
                
    The shared services agreement between Verso, NewPage and NewPage Corp was terminated;   
                
    The prior employee incentive plans and other employment agreements were terminated and any awards issued under them were no longer honored, and a new performance incentive plan was adopted by Verso;   
                
    Termination of the Management and Transaction Fee Agreement dated as of August 1, 2006 among Verso Paper LLC, Verso Paper Investments LP, Apollo Management V, L.P., and Apollo Management VI, L.P., and all rights and remedies thereunder were terminated, extinguished, waived and released; and 
                
    Employee retirement contracts and collective bargaining agreements will be honored by the Company upon emergence. 
     Pursuant to the Plan, on July 15, 2016, the Company entered into a $375 million asset-based revolving credit facility or the  Exit ABL Facility, and a senior secured term loan agreement or the  Exit Term Loan Facility  that provides for term loan commitments of $220 million or collectively the  Exit Credit Facilities.   Further, Verso Holdings borrowed   $340 million   under the Exit Credit Facilities on the Effective Date, with available loan proceeds of approximately   $318 million  , consisting of (i) the borrowing of   $120 million   under the Exit ABL Facility and (ii) the borrowing of   $198 million   (  $220 million   net of Original Issue Discount) under the Exit Term Loan Facility. The proceeds of the borrowings on the Effective Date under the Credit Facilities were used (i) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the debtor-in-possession financing credit agreements, (ii) to pay outstanding allowed administrative expenses and allowed claims in accordance with the Plan, and (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to and contemplated by the Credit Facilities and emergence by Verso and its subsidiaries from bankruptcy.

Financial Reporting Under Reorganization 
  See Note 2 of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements for further discussion of financial reporting implications related to our Chapter 11 Cases, and emergence therefrom, including a detail of liabilities subject to compromise and reorganization items, net.  
  Mill Closure 
  On April 5, 2016, Verso announced that it will permanently close its paper mill located in Wickliffe, Kentucky, which has been idle since November 2015.  The decision to close the mill resulted in restructuring charges of approximately   $7 million   and   $151 million   for the three and six month periods ending ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The associated Property, plant, and equipment were written down to salvage value resulting in a non-cash restructuring charge of $127 million. 

Presentation of Predecessor and Successor  
    
  We adopted fresh-start reporting as of the Effective Date. As a result of the application of fresh-start reporting, our financial statements for periods prior to the Effective Date are not comparable to those for periods subsequent to the Effective Date. References in this report to  Successor  refer to the Company on or after the Effective Date. References to  Predecessor  refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date. Operating results for the Successor and Predecessor periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year. References such as the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to Verso Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, whether Predecessor and/or Successor, as appropriate.  
    
  Management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and of liquidity compare the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Presentation of the combined financial information of the Predecessor and Successor for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or  GAAP.   However, we believe that for purposes of discussion and analysis in this Form 10-Q, the combined financial results are useful for management and investors to assess the Company s ongoing financial and operational performance and trends.  
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  The following tables set forth the historical results of operations of Verso for the periods indicated below.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.   
  
   41 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net Sales.   Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately   $107 million  , or 14%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was attributable to a 10% reduction in volume from 910 thousand tons during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 817 thousand tons for the same period of the current year and a 4% reduction in price, from $860 per ton during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $824 per ton for the same period of the current year. The   decrease   in sales volume resulted in   $77 million   of   reduced   revenue, while changes in pricing resulted in a   $33 million   reduction in revenue.  The decrease in volume and pricing were driven by general softening of demand for coated papers, our capacity reductions at our Androscoggin mill and the closure of the Wickliffe mill.  
    
  Cost of products sold.    Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $35 million  , or 5%, compared to the same period of the prior year.  Our gross margin percentage, excluding depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense, was 5% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 13% for the same period of the prior year, reflecting a $72 million decrease in gross margin.  Gross margin was negatively impacted by the decrease in sales volume, work-in-process and inventory fair value adjustments associated with fresh-start accounting of   $38 million  , as well as by the effects of two accounting policy changes adopted in conjunction with fresh-start reporting.  As part of fresh-start reporting, we decided to no longer defer the cost of planned major maintenance outages. Costs for all repair and maintenance activities are now expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting (See Note 1).  Approximately   $20 million   in incremental costs are expensed in Cost of products sold in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) related to planned major maintenance outages.  Certain centralized costs attributable to manufacturing overhead recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor.  The amount recorded to Cost of products sold, related to these costs, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) is approximately   $7 million  .  
    
  Depreciation, amortization, and depletion  . Depreciation, amortization, and depletion expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $29 million  , or 48%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The reduction in depreciation, amortization, and depletion is attributable to the capacity reductions at our Androscoggin mill, the closure of the Wickliffe mill and the reduction in the fair value of our property, plant and equipment as a result of the adoption of fresh-start accounting.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately   $2 million  , or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year.  The decline is primarily  
  
   42 

attributable to a change in accounting policy adopted in connection with fresh-start accounting.  As described in Cost of products sold above, approximately   $7 million   of costs recorded to Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor. This decrease to Selling, general and administrative expenses in the current period is offset by a $3 million increase related to the recognition of previously unrecognized stock compensation costs as all outstanding stock compensation of the Predecessor were cancelled upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.  As a percentage of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 4.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.2% for the same period of the prior year. 
    
  Restructuring charges.   Restructuring charges for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $53 million  , or 96%, to approximately $2 million from approximately $55 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring charges for three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of on-going care-taker costs related to the permanent closure of Wickliffe mill which are expensed as incurred. Restructuring charges during the third quarter of 2015 consisted primarily of $34 million of noncash charges related to accelerated depreciation on property and equipment at our Androscoggin mill, and $15 million of severance and benefit costs related primarily to the production capacity reductions at our Androscoggin and Wickliffe mills. 
    
  Other operating (income) expense.    Other operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $2 million   was primarily attributable to on-going costs incurred for professional fees paid for legal, consulting, and other bankruptcy related costs and services. There were no similar costs or charges during the three months ended  September 30, 2015.  
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $58 million  , or 85%, to approximately $10 million from approximately $68 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The change in interest expense year over year reflects the fact that we ceased recording interest expense as of January 26, 2016 on outstanding pre-petition debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise, or  LSTC.  Such interest on pre-petition debt was stayed by the Bankruptcy Court effective on the Petition Date. During the pendency of the bankruptcy, the Predecessor incurred interest expense on the DIP Facilities.  During the period from Emergence date through September 30, 2016, the Successor incurred interest expense the outstanding balance of the Exit Credit Facilities. 
    
  Reorganization items, net.    Reorganization items, net, which represent expenses and income directly associated with the Predecessor s bankruptcy filing on January 26, 2016, resulted in a net gain of   $1,302 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This amount represents a gain on settlement of LSTC and the DIP Facilities of $2,002 million offset by a loss of   $661 million   due to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities as part of the application of fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date.  Additionally, we incurred $20 million of professional fees paid for legal, consulting, and other bankruptcy related costs and services.  We also incurred   $16 million   of charges related to adjusting the liability related to rejected executory contracts to their estimated allowed claim amounts.  There were no similar gains, costs, or charges during the three months ended  September 30, 2015.  

43 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net Sales.   Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately   $371 million  , or 16%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was attributable to a 13% reduction in volume from 2.7 million tons during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.4 million tons during the same period of the current year and a 3% reduction in price, from $863 per ton during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $838 per ton for the same period of the current year. The   decline   in sales volume resulted in   $291 million   of   reduced   revenue, while the reduced pricing resulted in an additional   $80 million   decrease in revenue.  The decrease in volume and pricing were driven by general softening of demand for coated papers, our capacity reductions at our Androscoggin mill and the closure of the Wickliffe mill.  
    
  Cost of products sold.    Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $254 million  , or 12%, compared to the same period of the prior year. Our gross margin percentage, excluding depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense, was 9% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 13% for the same period of the prior year, reflecting a $117 million decrease in gross margin.  Gross margin was negatively impacted by the decrease in sales volume, work-in-process and inventory fair value adjustments associated with fresh-start accounting of   $38 million  , as well as by the effects of two accounting policy changes adopted in conjunction with fresh-start reporting.  As part of fresh-start reporting, we decided to no longer defer the cost of planned major maintenance outages. Costs for all repair and maintenance activities are now expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting. Approximately   $20 million   in incremental costs are expensed in Cost of products sold in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) related to planned major maintenance outages.  Certain centralized costs attributable to manufacturing overhead recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor.  The amount recorded to Cost of products sold, related to these costs, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) is approximately   $7 million  .  
    
  Depreciation, amortization, and depletion  . Depreciation, amortization, and depletion expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $57 million  , or 31%, compared to the same period of the prior year.  The reduction in Depreciation, amortization, and depletion is attributable to the capacity reductions at our Androscoggin mill, the closure of the Wickliffe mill and the reduction in the fair value of our property, plant and equipment as a result of the adoption of fresh-start accounting.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately   $16 million  , or 12%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year.  The change is  
  
   44 

attributable to synergies achieved from the NewPage acquisition as well as a change in accounting policy adopted in connection with fresh-start accounting.  As described in Cost of products sold above, approximately   $7 million   of costs recorded to Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor.  This decrease to Selling, general and administrative expenses in the current period is offset by a $3 million increase related to the recognition of previously unrecognized stock compensation costs as all outstanding stock compensation of the Predecessor were cancelled upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.  As a percentage of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 5.9% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 5.7% for the same period of the prior year. 
    
  Restructuring charges.   Restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately   $70 million  , or 84%, to approximately $153 million from approximately $83 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of non-cash fixed asset write-down charges and on-going care-taker costs related to the permanent closure of Wickliffe mill, the latter of which are expensed as incurred.  Restructuring charges for the nine months ended consisted primarily of $34 million of noncash charges related to accelerated depreciation on property and equipment at our Androscoggin mill, $15 million of severance and benefit costs related primarily to the production capacity reductions at our Androscoggin and Wickliffe mills, $16 million of severance and benefit costs related to efforts to integrate the legacy Verso and NewPage operations, and $12 million of expenses related to the sale of the Bucksport mill. 
    
  Other operating (income) expense.    Other operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $55 million   and was primarily attributable to the sale of hydroelectric facilities in January 2016 offset by on-going costs incurred for professional fees paid for legal, consulting, and other bankruptcy related costs and services. There were no similar income, costs or charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately   $154 million  , or 77%, to approximately $47 million from approximately $201 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The change in interest expense year over year reflects the fact that we ceased recording interest expense as of January 26, 2016 on outstanding pre-petition debt classified as LSTC. The interest on pre-petition debt was stayed by the Bankruptcy Court effective on the Petition Date. During the pendency of the bankruptcy, the Predecessor incurred interest expense on the DIP Facilities.  During the period from the Effective Date through September 30, 2016, the Successor incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of the Exit Credit Facilities. 
    
  Reorganization items, net.    Reorganization items, net, which represent expenses and income directly associated with the Predecessor s bankruptcy filing on the Petition Date, resulted in a net gain of   $1,338 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This amount represents a gain on settlement of LSTC and the DIP Facilities of $2,002 million offset by a loss of $671 due to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities as part of the application of fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date.  Additionally, we incurred $52 million of professional fees paid for legal, consulting, and other bankruptcy related costs and services.  We also incurred $15 million of charges related to adjusting the liability related to rejected executory contracts to their estimated allowed claim amounts.  There were no similar gains, costs, or charges during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Income tax (benefit) expense.    Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased by approximately   $2 million   compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the elimination of certain deferred tax liabilities associated with certain indefinite lived assets.  All assets were adjusted to fair value as of the Effective date in conjunction with the adoption of fresh-start accounting. 
    
  Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  EBITDA consists of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our performance.  We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a way of evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers and to assess compliance with our credit facilities.  We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure commonly used in our industry that provides investors and analysts with a measure of ongoing operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles, and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies.  
    
  We believe that the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.   
    
  Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of  
  
   45 

other companies.  You should consider our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  The following table reconciles net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented: 

(1) Net gains associated with the Chapter 11 Cases. 
  (2) For 2016, charges are primarily associated with the closure of the Wickliffe mill, of which $137 million is non-cash. For 2015, charges represent severance and employee-related costs and other restructuring charges associated with the NewPage acquisition, the closure of the Bucksport mill and the capacity reductions at the Androscoggin and Wickliffe mills. 
  (3) Non-cash charges related to the one-time impacts of adopting fresh-start accounting.  
  (4) Realized gains on the sale of assets, which are primarily attributable to the sale of hydroelectric facilities in January 2016. 
  (5) Costs incurred in connection with advisory and legal services related to planning for and emerging from the Chapter 11 Cases. 
  (6) Professional fees and other charges and integration costs incurred in connection with the NewPage acquisition, including one-time impacts of purchase accounting. 
  (7) Amortization of non-cash incentive compensation, unrealized losses (gains) on energy-related derivative contracts, Wickliffe operating costs while idled, and miscellaneous other non-recurring adjustments. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors common in the coated paper industry.  Typically, the first two quarters are our slowest quarters due to lower demand for coated paper during this period.  Our third quarter is generally our strongest quarter, reflecting an increase in printing related to end-of-year magazines, increased end-of-year direct mailings, and holiday season catalogs.  Our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter, while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season.  We expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our historical negative cash flows from operations caused an inability to support our significant interest payments and debt maturities and a need to refinance and/or extend the maturities of our outstanding debt.  On January 26, 2016, Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default and automatic acceleration under the agreements governing all of our debt (excluding the $23 million loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund).   
  
   46 

As described in Note 2, Verso emerged from its Chapter 11 Cases on July 15, 2016. Pursuant to the Plan, on July 15, 2016, the Company entered into a $375 million Exit ABL Facility and a $220 million Exit Term Loan Facility.  The Company borrowed $340 million under the Exit Credit Facilities on July 15, 2016, with available loan proceeds of approximately $318 million, consisting of $120 million of borrowings under the asset-based revolving credit facility and $198 million ($220 million net of Original Issue Discount) of borrowings under the term loan agreement. On July 15, 2016, the Company paid in full amounts outstanding related to its DIP Facilities with proceeds from the Exit Credit Facilities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the Exit ABL Facility is   $116 million  , with $  82 million   in letters of credit issued, and   $170 million   available for future borrowings.  
    
  Verso s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table.  

Operating activities.    In the period from July 15 to September 30, 2016 (Successor), net cash used in operating activities of   $13 million   primarily reflects a net loss of   $40 million   offset by non-cash depreciation, amortization, and accretion of   $24 million  .  In the period from January 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), net cash provided by operating activities of   $25 million   was driven by net income of   $1,178 million   offset by non-cash reorganization items of   $1,398 million  , deprecation, amortization, non-cash gain on sale of assets and non-cash restructuring charges of   $180 million  , and the change in cash used in working capital of   $43 million  .  
    
  In the   first nine months of     2015  , net cash used in operating activities of   $284 million   reflected a net loss of   $293 million   offset by noncash depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion of   $225 million   and an increase in cash used for working capital of $157 million, which was primarily due to seasonal increases in inventory and a decrease in accrued liabilities primarily attributable to payments of NewPage acquisition related and second lien and subordinated notes exchange offering related expenses, and severance and other costs associated with the Bucksport closure and NewPage acquisition. 
    
  Investing activities.   In the period from July 15 to September 30, 2016 (Successor), net cash used in investing activities of   $18 million   consists primarily of $  21 million    cash used for capital expenditures offset by a $  3 million   transfer from restricted cash. In the period from January 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), net cash provided by investing activities of   $29 million   consists primarily of $  63 million   of proceeds from the sale of certain hydroelectric generation facilities and related assets, partially offset by $  31 million   of capital expenditures.      
    
  This compares to   $127 million   of net cash provided by investing activities in the   first nine months of     2015   (Predecessor), which reflects cash acquired in the NewPage acquisition of   $128 million   as well as proceeds from sale of assets of   $51 million   including the sale of the Bucksport mill, and were partially offset by capital expenditures of   $48 million  .   
    
  Financing activities.   In the period from July 15 to September 30, 2016 (Successor), net cash used in financing activities of $  9 million   resulted primarily from net payments of $4 million on the Exit ABL Facility and another $4 million on the Exit Term Loan Facility.  In the period from January 1 to July 14, 2016 (Predecessor), net cash used in financing activities of   $11 million   resulted primarily from net payments on pre-petition revolving credit facilities of $299 million, $22 million of debt issuance cost on the debtor-in-possession financing, offset by proceeds from the Exit ABL Facility of $120 million and proceeds net of  debt issuance cost and original issue discount of the Exit Term Loan Facility of $190 million.  
    
  In the   first nine months of     2015   (Predecessor), net cash provided by financing activities was   $161 million  , and resulted primarily from net borrowings on our pre-petition revolving credit facilities. 
    
  DIP Financing.   In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, Verso Finance, Verso Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Verso DIP Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, and NewPage Corp and certain of its  
  
   47 

subsidiaries entered into the NewPage DIP ABL Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $325 million and the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million.  The NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility consisted of $175 million of new money term loans and $175 million of  rolled up  loans refinancing loans outstanding under the existing term loan facility of NewPage Corp outstanding on the Petition Date (i.e., such loans were deemed to become loans under the NewPage DIP Term Loan Facility).  On January 28, 2016, up to $550 million in loans under the DIP Facilities became available for borrowing following the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Facilities on an interim basis on January 27, 2016.  The Bankruptcy Court entered orders approving the DIP Facilities on a final basis on March 2, 2016.  The issuers and guarantors of the Verso DIP Facility did not guarantee the obligations under the NewPage DIP Facilities, and the borrower and the guarantors under the NewPage DIP Facilities did not guarantee the obligations under the Verso DIP Facility.  The DIP Facilities were scheduled to mature on July 28, 2017     unless, prior to the end of such term, (a) a plan of reorganization filed in the Chapter 11 Cases was confirmed pursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, or (b) the loans were accelerated and commitments terminated in accordance with the terms of the DIP Facilities.  On June 23, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order and subsequently, on July 15, 2016, the Debtors satisfied the conditions of the Confirmation Order and the Plan became effective.  Thus, the DIP Facilities matured on July 15, 2016 and were repaid in full using proceeds from the Exit Credit Facilities entered into on the Effective Date.  
    
  Exit Credit Facilities.   On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of Plan, Verso Holdings entered into a   $375 million   Exit ABL Facility and an Exit Term Loan Facility that provides for term loan commitments of   $220 million   with available loan proceeds of   $198 million  .  
     
  Verso Holdings borrowed   $340 million   under the Exit Credit Facilities on the Effective Date, with available loan proceeds of approximately   $318 million  , consisting of (i) the borrowing of   $120 million   under the Exit ABL Facility and (ii) the net borrowing of   $198 million   (  $220 million   par value less   $22 million   of  original issue discount) under the Exit Term Loan Facility.  The proceeds of the borrowings on the Effective Date under the Exit Credit Facilities were used (i) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the debtor-in-possession financing credit agreements, (ii) to pay outstanding allowed administrative expenses and allowed claims in accordance with the Plan, and (iii) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to and contemplated by the Exit Credit Facilities and emergence by Verso and its subsidiaries from bankruptcy.  The proceeds of the borrowings under the Exit ABL Facility after the Effective Date will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.  
    
  The Exit ABL Facility will mature on   July 14, 2021  .  The outstanding borrowings under the Exit ABL Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the option of Verso Holdings, either (i) a customary London interbank offered rate, or  LIBOR,  plus an applicable margin ranging from   1.25%   to   2.00%   or (ii) a customary base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   0.25%   to   1.00%  , determined based upon the average excess availability under the Exit ABL Facility.  Verso Holdings is also required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Exit ABL Facility, which ranges from   0.25%   to   0.375%   per annum, based upon the average revolver usage under the Exit ABL Facility.  Verso Holdings has the right to prepay loans under the Exit ABL Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty, other than customary  breakage  costs with respect to eurocurrency loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the Exit ABL Facility is   $116 million  , with $  82 million   in letters of credit issued, and   $170 million   available for future borrowings.   
  The Exit Term Loan Facility will mature on   October 14, 2021  .The outstanding borrowings under the Exit Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of Verso Holdings, either (i) LIBOR (subject to a floor of   1%  ) plus   11%   or (ii) a customary base rate plus   10%  .  With respect to LIBOR denominated loans under the Exit Credit Facilities, Verso Holdings may elect an interest period of one, two, three or six months or such other period subject to the terms of the Exit Credit Facilities.  The term loans provided under the Exit Term Loan Facility are subject to quarterly principal amortization payments in an amount equal to the greater of (a)   2.00%   of the initial principal amount of the term loans or (b) the excess cash flow in respect of such quarter as further described under the Exit Term Loan Facility; however, if the liquidity, as defined in the Exit Term Loan Facility, of Verso Holdings is less than   $75 million   at any time during the 90-day period following the due date of such quarterly amortization payment or excess cash flow payment date, then the portion of such amortization amount that results in such liquidity being less than   $75 million   will not be payable by Verso Holdings, as further described in the Exit Term Loan Facility.  Per the described quarterly principal amortization, installments due are   $4 million   (subject to increase depending on excess cash flow) for each quarter ending in 2016 through 2021 with the remaining balance due on   October 14, 2021  .  Any voluntary prepayment by Verso Holdings of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility will be subject to customary  breakage  costs with respect to eurocurrency loans and a   2%   call premium until July 14, 2018, and a   1%   call premium after July 15, 2018, but before July 14, 2020, and thereafter no call premium will apply to any voluntary prepayment of term loans.  Such call premium may also apply to certain repricing amendments of the Term Loan Facility as further described therein. 
  All obligations under the Exit Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by Verso Finance, and certain of the subsidiaries of Verso Holdings and are secured by liens on certain assets of Verso Finance and liens on substantially all of the assets of  
  
   48 

Verso Holdings and the other guarantor subsidiaries.  The security interest with respect to the Exit ABL Facility consists of a first-priority lien on the current assets of Verso Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries, including accounts receivables, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts and commodities accounts, and a second-priority lien on all other collateral.  The security interest with respect to the Exit Term Loan Facility, consists of a first-priority lien on all other collateral and second-priority lien on collateral securing the Exit ABL Facility. 
  The Exit ABL Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company, among other things, to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances and a maximum total net leverage ratio.  The Exit Credit Facilities also contain restrictions, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, on the Company s ability to incur debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interest, prepay indebtedness, sell or dispose of assets, and make investments in or merge with another company.  
    
  Covenant Compliance 
    
  Exit Credit Facilities  
    
  As described in Note 2, Verso emerged from bankruptcy on July 15, 2016 and entered into the Exit Credit Facilities. The Exit ABL Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company, among other things, to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances and the Exit Term Loan Facility is subject to a maximum total net leverage ratio. The Exit Credit Facilities also contain restrictions, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, on the Company s ability to inure debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interest, prepay indebtedness, sell or dispose of assets, and make investments in or merge with another company. 
    
  If Verso Holdings were to violate any of the covenants under the Exit ABL Facility or the Exit Term Loan Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period. If Verso Holdings were in default under any Exit Credit Facility, then the lenders thereunder may exercise remedies under such Exit Credit Facility in accordance with the terms thereof. In addition, if Verso Holdings were in default under the Exit ABL Facility, no additional borrowings under the Exit ABL Facility would be available until the default was waived or cured. The Exit Credit Facilities provide for customary events of default, including a cross-event of default provision in respect of any other existing debt instrument having an aggregate principal amount that exceeds $25 million. 
  DIP Facilities 
  The Company paid in full amounts outstanding related to its DIP Facilities with proceeds from the Exit Credit Facilities on July 15, 2016. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.  Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the industry in which we operate.  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions in determining accounting estimates.  Accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, that would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see  Critical Accounting Policies  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have made no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 other than the following:  
    
  Predecessor  Planned Major Maintenance Costs     Costs for  planned major maintenance shutdowns were deferred and then expensed ratably over the period until the next major planned shutdown, since we believed that operations benefited throughout that period from the maintenance work performed.  Routine maintenance costs were expensed as incurred. 
    
  Successor Maintenance Costs     Costs for all repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the month that the related activity is performed under the direct expense method of accounting.  Approximately   $20 million   of incremental costs were  
  
   49 

expensed in Cost of products sold in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) related to planned major maintenance outages. 
    
  Successor Cost of products sold/ Selling, general and administrative expenses     Certain centralized costs attributable to manufacturing overhead recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses of the Predecessor are recorded to Cost of products sold of the Successor.  The amount recorded to Cost of products sold, related to these costs, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 15, 2016 to September 30, 2016 (Successor) is approximately   $7 million  .

  See Note 3,  Recent Accounting Developments  in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in our paper prices, interest rates, energy prices, and commodity prices for our inputs.  
    
  Paper Prices 
    
  Our sales, which we report net of rebates, allowances, and discounts, are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper.   Paper prices historically have been a function of macroeconomic factors that influence supply and demand.  Price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods.  Prices are also subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the Euro, which can lead to lower average sales price realization. 
    
  We are primarily focused on serving the following end-user segments: general commercial print, catalogs and magazines. Coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage.  Advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with gross domestic product in the United States, as they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy, which impacts media spend which further impacts magazine and catalog subscriptions. 
    
  Many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs, which allows us to plan our production runs in advance, optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency.  Generally, our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year, and they typically provide for semiannual price adjustments based on market price movements. 
    
  We reach our end-users through several channels, including printers, brokers, paper merchants, and direct sales to end-users.  We sell and market our products to approximately   300   customers.  During the nine months ended September 30,   2016  ,   Veritiv Corporation   accounted for approximately   20%   of our total net sales. 
    
  Interest Rates 
    
  Since December 31, 2015, we and substantially all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.  In connection with our Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into the DIP Facilities, which accrued interest at a variable rate.  Upon the Effective Date, we entered into the Exit Credit Facilities.  Borrowings under the Exit Credit Facilities accrue interest at a variable rate. 
    
  Our Exit ABL Facility and Exit Term Loan Facility each bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or a customary base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.  Our Exit Term Loan Facility had a LIBOR floor of 1%.  Assuming the Exit Term Loan Facility Assuming the principal amount outstanding under the Exit ABL Facility remains unchanged as of September 30, 2016, and the Exit Term Loan Facility interest remains at or above the LIBOR floor, a 100 basis point increase in quoted interest rates on our outstanding floating-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  , would have increased annual interest expense by approximately   $3 million  .  While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. 

50 

Commodity Prices 
    
  We are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements underlying commodity prices.  The principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals, wood, energy, labor, maintenance, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion.  Costs for commodities, including chemicals, wood and energy, are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially, sometimes within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce. 
    
  Chemicals.    Chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex, clay, starch, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate, and titanium dioxide.  We purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs.  We expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals. 
    
  Wood.    Our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities.  While we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements, purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates. 
    
  Energy.    In 2016, we produced approximately   54%   of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood, waste water, hydroelectric facilities, liquid biomass from our pulping process, and internal energy cogeneration facilities.  Our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil, natural gas, coal, and electricity.  While our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures, we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future.  We utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error or the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and even effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of Verso s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based upon this evaluation, and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Verso s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in Verso s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

51 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business.  We do not believe that any liability that may result from these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS 
    
  For a detailed discussion of risk factors affecting us, see    Part I   Item 1A. Risk Factors    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and    Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors    in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Other than as noted below, we have not had any material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  
  Our financial condition and results of operations for periods after the effective date of our plan of reorganization are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to the effective date of our plan of reorganization. 
    
  On July 15, 2016, the effective date of our plan of reorganization, we adopted fresh-start reporting as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization as prescribed in accordance with GAAP and the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 852, Reorganizations. As required by fresh-start reporting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value by allocating the reorganization value determined in connection with the plan of reorganization. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations from and after the effective date of our plan of reorganization are not comparable, in various material respects, to the financial condition and results of operations prior to the effective date of our plan of reorganization.

  Information required by this Item 2 has been previously disclosed by us on Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on July 19, 2016.
