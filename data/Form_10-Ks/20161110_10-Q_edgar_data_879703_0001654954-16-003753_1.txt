(Formerly Direct Insite Corp.) 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED) 

Note 1   Nature of Business 

Paybox
Corp ( Paybox  or the  Company ) operates
as a Software as a Service provider ( SaaS ), providing
financial supply chain automation and workflow efficiencies within
the Procure-to-Pay and Order-to-Cash processes. Specifically,
Paybox s global electronic invoice ( e-invoice )
management services automate complex manual business processes such
as invoice validation, order matching, consolidation, dispute
handling, and e-payment processing in a business-to-business
transaction based  fee for services  business
model. 

On
September 26, 2016, the Company changed its name from Direct Insite
Corp. to Paybox Corp to align the corporate name and brand with the
Company s globally deployed Working Capital Management
Platform, Paybox   . 

The
Company s revenue comes from (i) recurring, on-going services
that are billed monthly; and (ii) non-recurring, professional
services derived from the configuration of the Company s
software platform. 

Throughout the
year, the Company operated redundant data centers in Miami,
Florida, and Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

As
described in Note   9, the
Company has four major customers that accounted for 86.4% and 87.7%
of the Company s revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 88.4% and 89.7% of the
Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Loss of any of these customers would
have a material effect on the Company. 

In
November 2015, we were notified by HP Enterprise Services
( HPE ) that one of its clients, representing
approximately 3.9% and 14.7% of our revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was terminating
its contract with HPE effective February 23, 2016. As disclosed in
our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 19,
2016, despite efforts to negotiate a direct contractual agreement
with this client, the client ultimately decided to terminate its
use of our services, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded
revenue from this client after February 2016. We were further
notified by HPE in August 2016 that another of its clients,
representing 5.8% and 6.3% of our revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was terminating its
contract with HPE effective August 15, 2016, and accordingly, the
Company has not recorded revenue from this client after August
2016. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Interim Financial Information 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements
include the accounts of Paybox. The condensed balance sheet as of
September 30, 2016, the condensed statements of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the
condensed statements of cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 have not been audited. These unaudited
condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial
information and with the instructions to quarterly reports on Form
10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The
December 31, 2015 balance sheet was derived from audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required
by GAAP. These interim condensed financial statements include all
adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial statements and consist of normal
recurring items. The results of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of
results that may be expected for any other interim period or for
the full year. 

These
unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto
for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the
Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on
March 22, 2016.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued) 

Use of Estimates 

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The most significant estimates are used in the accounting related
to stock based compensation, the valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets and capitalized internally developed software. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

The
Company records revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC
605 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 , Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements . Revenue is recognized when it is both earned and
realizable, that is, when the following criteria are
met: 

persuasive evidence
of arrangements exist; 

        delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered; 

        the seller s
price is fixed and determinable; and 

        collectability is
reasonably assured. 

The
following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each
major category of revenue. 

Recurring
(Ongoing Services) 

The
Company provides transactional data processing services through its
SaaS software solutions to its customers. The customer is charged a
monthly fixed rate on a per transaction basis or a fixed fee based
on monthly transaction volumes. Revenue is recognized as the
services are provided. 

Non-Recurring
(Professional Services) 

The
Company provides non-recurring engineering services to its
customers, which may include initial or additional development,
modification, and customization services to the Company s
software platform. Such services are billed based on: (i) hourly
rates; or (ii) milestone billings. For hourly billed services,
revenue is recognized when work is performed. For milestone billed
services, revenue is recognized when the project milestone has been
accepted by the customer. We do not sell software licenses,
upgrades or enhancements, or post-contract customer
services. 

Internally Developed Software 

The
Company released the first phase of PAYBOX , a new version of
its accounts receivable platform in November 2014. It was designed
for a global bank and is available to all Order-to-Cash process
customers. According to ASC 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other-Internal-Use Software, the Company is able to capitalize the
costs associated with the application development stage of a
project. The Company started amortizing capitalized costs when the
software was ready for use and placed in service in November 2014.
The capitalized costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated five-year useful life of the software. As
additional functionality is added, costs incurred are capitalized
in accordance with ASC 350-40. Precontract software development
costs are generally charged to operating costs and expenses as
incurred, however, in accordance with professional standards the
Company defers precontract costs when such costs are directly
associated with specific anticipated contracts for which recovery
is probable.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued) 

Income Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method. This method requires the determination of deferred tax
assets and liabilities based on the differences between the
financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities,
using enacted tax rates. Additionally, net deferred tax assets are
adjusted by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In
addition, the Company expects to provide a valuation allowance on
the remaining future tax benefits until it can sustain a level of
profitability that demonstrates its ability to utilize the
remaining assets, or other significant positive evidence arises
that suggests its ability to utilize the remaining assets. The
future realization of a portion of its reserved deferred tax assets
related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock
options, if and when realized, will not result in a tax benefit in
the statement of operations, but rather will result in an increase
in additional paid-in capital. The Company will continue to
re-assess its reserves on deferred income tax assets in future
periods on a quarterly basis. 

Earnings Per Share 

The
Company displays earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260,
 Earnings Per Share 
( ASC 260 ). ASC 260 requires dual presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ). Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share include the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. 

The
computation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding
used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as
follows (in thousands): 

Securities that
could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future, that were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would
have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented, consists of the
following (in thousands):

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued) 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable.
The Company has cash deposits in excess of the maximum amounts
insured by the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its
customers. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable and revenue are disclosed in Note 9. 

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation:
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,
which changes how companies account for certain aspects of
share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires all
income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income
statement when the awards vest or are settled, allows an employer
to repurchase more of an employee s shares than previously
allowed for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability
accounting, allows a company to make a policy election to account
for forfeitures as they occur, and eliminates the requirement that
excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize
them. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits and tax
shortfalls to be presented on the cash flow statement as an
operating activity rather than as a financing activity, and
clarifies that cash paid to a tax authority when shares are
withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation
are to be presented as a financing activity. The standard is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected
to adopt this standard early and applied it as of January 1, 2016,
with no significant impact on its financial
statements. 

Several
ASUs were issued during March through November 2016 that modified
ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . The Company is currently
evaluating the effect of the new accounting guidance, including
these modifications, on its financial statements or notes
thereto. 

Note 3   Property and Equipment 

Property and
equipment (with their respective useful lives) consist of the
following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in
thousands): 

Depreciation and
amortization expense related to property and equipment for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $56,000 and $64,000, respectively. 

Depreciation and
amortization expense related to property and equipment for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
$176,000 and $220,000, respectively. 

8 

Note 4   Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 

Accounts payable
and accrued expenses consist of the following at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

Note 5   Capital Lease Obligations 

The
Company had equipment under two capital lease obligations that
expired as of June 2016. The assets and liabilities under capital
leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the
minimum lease payments or the fair values of the assets. There were
no remaining payments due under these capital leases as of
September 30, 2016. 

The
implied interest rates related to these capital leases range from
7.4% to 8.9%. The gross book value and the net book value of the
related assets are approximately $77,000 and $1,000, respectively,
as of September 30, 2016, and $77,000 and $21,000, respectively, as
of December 31, 2015. 

Note 6   Stockholders  Equity 

Preferred Stock 

The
Company is authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
of which none were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

Common Stock, Options and Stock Grants 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 162,000 restricted common
shares were granted with an aggregate grant date fair value of
approximately $100,000. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, approximately 121,000 restricted common shares with an
aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $82,000 vested.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized approximately $30,000 of stock based compensation
expense related to the expected vesting of stock
options. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 135,000 restricted common
shares were granted with an aggregate grant date fair value of
approximately $100,000. During this time, approximately 81,000
restricted common shares with an aggregate grant date fair value of
approximately $65,000 vested. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company issued 111,602 shares of restricted
common stock pursuant to the Company s Directors 
Deferred Compensation Plan dated January 1, 2008 (the
 Directors  Deferred Compensation Plan ). These
shares were issued to settle approximately $103,175 of accrued
directors  fees to two former directors for past services.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
recognized $92,000 of stock based compensation expense related to
the expected vesting of 124,000 options. Outstanding options vest
over a four-year period, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary
of the grant date and the remaining 75% vesting in equal monthly
amounts through the fourth anniversary of the grant date. In March
2015, 90,000 options were awarded to employees. These options vest
over three years with 33% vesting at the end of each of the three
years. These options expire after a five-year term. 

9 

Note 6   Stockholders  Equity (continued) 

Common Stock, Options and Stock Grants (continued) 

The
Company estimates the grant date fair value of the stock option
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option model and the following
assumptions: volatility of 90%, risk free rate of 0.89%, dividend
rate of zero, and expected term of 3.75 years. The grant date fair
value of the stock options issued was determined to be
approximately $44,100. 

Stock Option Plans 

The
Company has granted options under multiple stock-based compensation
plans that do not differ substantially in the characteristics of
the awards. Nonqualified and incentive stock options have been
granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company under
the Company s stock option plans. Options generally vest over
three to four years and expire five years from the date of the
grant. On June 3, 2014, the Company s stockholders approved
the adoption of the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014
Plan ).  The 2014 Plan replaces the 2004 Stock
Option/Stock Issuance Plan which expired on August 20, 2014. 
The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options, and stock appreciation rights,
shares of restricted stock, stock units and shares of unrestricted
stock.  Eligible participants include officers, employees and
directors.  The aggregate number of shares authorized for
issuance under the 2014 Plan is 1,200,000, and is subject to
adjustment as described in the 2014 Plan .  As of
September 30, 2016, 622,808 shares were available for issuance
under the 2014 plan. Awards that expire or are cancelled without
delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under
the plans. 

The
following is a summary of stock option activity for nine months
ended September 30, 2016, relating to all of the Company s
common stock plans: 

The
following table summarizes stock option information as of September
30, 2016: 

As of
September 30, 2016, there was approximately $38,000 of unrecognized
compensation costs related to stock options
outstanding.

Restricted Stock Grants 

A
summary of the status of the Company s non-vested stock
grants as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months
then ended is presented below: 

The
future expected expense as of September 30, 2016 for non-vested
shares is approximately $75,000 and will be recognized as expense
through December 31, 2017. 

Note 7   Income Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,
 Income Taxes , which
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also
provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

The
Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax
return in Florida as  major  tax jurisdictions, as
defined in ASC 740. Based on the Company s evaluation, it has
been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax
positions requiring recognition in the Company s financial
statements. The Company s evaluation was performed for tax
years ended 2011 through 2015, the only periods subject to
examination. The Company believes that its income tax positions and
deductions would be sustained upon audit and does not anticipate
any adjustments that would result in a material change to its
financial position. The Company has elected to classify interest
and penalties incurred on income taxes, if any, as income tax
expense. No interest or penalties on income taxes have been
recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefit position
to change during the next twelve months. 

Management is
currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in
significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its
position. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has a federal net operating loss
carryforward ( NOLs ) remaining of approximately $25
million, which may be available to reduce taxable income, if any.
Due to changes in certain state tax laws, the previous state NOL of
$20 million may no longer be utilized by the Company. Remaining
federal net operating loss carry forwards expire from 2019 through
2035. However, Internal Revenue Code Section 382 rules limit the
utilization of NOLs upon a change in control of a company. During
2015, the Company performed an evaluation as to whether a change in
control had taken place. Management believes that there has been no
change in control in accordance with Section 382. However, if it is
determined that an ownership change has taken place, either
historically or in the future, utilization of its NOLs could be
subject to severe limitations, which could eliminate a substantial
portion of the future income tax benefits of the NOLs. The NOL
carryforward as of September 30, 2016 included approximately
$1,195,000 related to windfall tax benefits for which a benefit
would be recorded in additional paid-in capital if and when
realized.

Note 8   Commitment and Contingencies 

The

OVERVIEW 

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
August 27, 1987. We consummated our initial public offering in
1992. In May 1990, we changed our name to Computer Concepts, Inc.,
in August 2000, we changed our name to Direct Insite Corp., and in
September 2016, we changed our name to Paybox Corp
( Paybox ). 

Paybox
operates as a SaaS, providing best practice financial supply chain
automation and workflow efficiencies within the Order-to-Cash and
Procure-to-Pay processes. Specifically, Paybox s global
e-invoice management services automate complex manual business
processes such as invoice validation, order matching,
consolidation, dispute handling, and e-payment processing in a
business-to-business transaction based  fee for
services  business model. 

Through
the automation and workflow of Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay
processes and the presentation of invoices, orders, and attachment
data via a self-service portal, Paybox is helping our customers
reduce manual invoice-to-order reconciliation costs, reduce the
frequency of inquiries and disputes, improve cash flow, increase
competitiveness and improve customer satisfaction. 

Paybox
is currently delivering service and business value across the
Americas, Europe, and Asia, including more than 100 countries, in
17 languages and multiple currencies. Paybox processes more than
$160 billion in invoice value annually on behalf of our clients.
Paybox processes, distributes and hosts millions of invoices,
purchase orders, and supporting attachment documents, making them
accessible on-line with an internet self-service portal. Suppliers,
customers, and internal departments, such as Finance and Accounting
or Customer Service users, can easily access their business
documents. 

Our
revenue comes from (i) recurring, on-going services that are billed
monthly; and (ii) non-recurring, professional services derived from
the configuration of our software platform. 

HP
Enterprise Services ( HPE ) accounted for approximately
17.0% and 34.0% of revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 23.3% and 32.8% of
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had three principal
contracts with HPE providing e-invoice services. These contracts
have terms ranging from one to five years. The contracts may be
terminated by either party with ninety days  advance written
notice. In November 2015, we were notified by HPE that one of its
clients, representing approximately 3.9% and 14.7% of our revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively
was terminating its contract with HPE effective February 23, 2016.
As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC
on February 19, 2016, despite efforts to negotiate a direct
contractual agreement with this client, the client ultimately
decided to terminate its use of our services, and accordingly, the
Company has not recorded revenue from this client after February
2016. We were further notified by HPE in August 2016 that another
of its clients, representing 5.8% and 6.3% of our revenue for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was
terminating its contract with HPE effective August 15, 2016, and
accordingly, the Company has not recorded revenue from this client
after August 2016. 

13 

International
Business Machines, Inc. ( IBM ), representing
approximately 43.9% and 36.4%, of revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately
41.3% and 37.8%, of revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, utilizes our suite of services to
allow its customers from around the globe to receive, analyze,
dispute and cost allocate all of their invoice data in their local
language and currency via the internet. We have two principal
contracts with IBM to provide e-invoice services for substantially
all of IBM s operating units. On October 28, 2013, one of
these contracts was extended for a three-year period, through
December 31, 2016, and is renewable annually thereafter. The other
contract was renewed through December 31, 2016, and is renewable
annually thereafter. The contracts may be terminated by either
party with ninety days advance written notice. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

On
September 26, 2016, the Company, pursuant to a certificate of
amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, changed the
Company s corporate name from Direct Insite Corp. to Paybox
Corp to align the corporate name and brand with the Company s
globally deployed Working Capital Management Platform,
Paybox   . 

SEASONALITY / QUANTITY FLUCTUATIONS 

Revenue
from SaaS ongoing services generally is not subject to fluctuations
or seasonal flows. However, we believe that revenue derived from
custom engineering services will have a significant tendency to
fluctuate based on customer demand. 

Other
factors, including, but not limited to, new service introductions,
domestic and global economic conditions, customer budgetary
considerations, and the timing of service upgrades may create
fluctuations. As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results
for any future period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

The
following is a summary of operating results for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
total revenue decreased by $316,000, or 16.4%, to $1,608,000 from
$1,924,000 for the comparable prior year
period.  Recurring revenue decreased by $411,000, or
24.4%, to $1,272,000 for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016, from $1,683,000 for the
comparable prior year period, primarily  due to the
previously noted loss of the HPE clients in February and August
2016.  Non-recurring revenue increased
by $95,000, or 39.4%, to $336,000 for the three months ended 
September 30 , 2016, due to higher
customer requested modifications and
enhancements.  

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Costs
of operations, research and development decreased by approximately
$108,000, or 14.0%, to $663,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $771,000 for the comparable prior year
period. These costs consist principally of salaries and related
expenses for software development, programming, custom engineering,
network services, and quality control and
assurance.  Also included are costs for purchased
services, network costs, costs of the production co-location
facilities and other expenses directly related to our custom
engineering and SaaS services.  The decrease was
primarily due to a headcount-related reduction in compensation
expense and lower cloud license fees, partially offset by higher
scanning charges. 

General
and administrative costs decreased by approximately $85,000, or
15.0%, to $481,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $566,000 for the comparable prior year period, primarily due
to a decrease in salary expense and legal fees. 

Sales
and marketing costs increased by approximately $62,000, or 18.4%,
to $399,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$337,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to higher
compensation and trade show expenses, partially offset by lower
professional fees. 

Amortization and
depreciation decreased by approximately $8,000, or
12.5% , to $56,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $64,000 for the comparable prior year
period,  as the amortization of internally developed software
costs were offset by existing assets that became fully depreciated
during the interim period. 

15 

Operating Income 

We had
operating income of $9,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to operating income of $186,000 for the
comparable prior year period, due to the aforementioned decrease in
revenue offset by the lower expenses. 

Other Expense, net 

Other
expense for the quarter was $1,000, compared $0 in the comparable
prior year period. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We
recorded a Florida income tax provision of $24,000 during the third
quarter of 2015 and $1,000 during the third quarter of
2016. 

Net Income 

Net
income decreased by approximately $155,000, to $7,000, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net
income of $162,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to the
decrease in operating income, partially offset by a reduction
in the income tax provision. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

The
following is a summary of operating results for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
total revenue decreased by $1,004,000, or 16.6%, to $5,045,000 from
$6,049,000 for the comparable prior year
period.  Recurring revenue decreased by $1,008,000, or
19.8%, to $4,078,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
from $5,086,000 for the comparable prior year period. This was
primarily due to the  previously noted loss of the HPE
clients in February and August 2016.  Non-recurring revenue increased by $4,000, to
$967,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $963,000
for the comparable prior year period.  

16 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Costs
of operations, research, and development decreased by approximately
$572,000, or 22.2%, to $2,010,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $2,582,000 for the comparable prior year
period. These costs consist principally of salaries and related
expenses for software development, programming, custom engineering,
network services, and quality control and
assurance.  Also included are costs for purchased
services, network costs, costs of the production co-location
facilities and other expenses directly related to our custom
engineering and SaaS services.  The lower expense
reflects a $438,000 headcount-related decrease in compensation
expense and lower cloud license fees. 

General
and administrative costs decreased by approximately $112,000, or
6.4%, to $1,640,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
from $1,752,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to lower
compensation-related costs and legal and professional
fees. 

Sales
and marketing costs decreased by approximately $44,000, or 3.9%, to
$1,073,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
$1,117,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to lower
consulting and professional fees. 

Amortization and
depreciation decreased by approximately $44,000, or
20.0% , to $176,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $220,000 for the comparable prior
year period  as the amortization of internally developed
software costs were offset by existing assets that became fully
depreciated during the interim period. 

Operating
Income 

Operating income
decreased by approximately $232,000 to $146,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to operating income of
$378,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to the
aforementioned decrease in revenue, partially offset by the
decrease in operating costs and expenses. 

Other Expense, net 

Other
expense decreased to $1,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 from $2,000 for the comparable prior year period. 

Provision for Income Tax 

We
recorded a Florida income tax provision of $24,000 during the third
quarter of 2015. This provision decreased by $23,000 to $1,000 due
to the reduction in income. 

Net Income 

We had
net income of $144,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, a decrease of approximately $208,000, or 59.1%, from net
income of $352,000 for the comparable prior year period, due to the
aforementioned decrease in operating income. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 

As of
September 30, 2016, we had total stockholders  equity of
approximately $5,340,000, working capital of $2,696,000 and an
accumulated deficit of $110,923,000. Our cash increased by $209,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $2,584,000 of
cash on hand as of September 30, 2016, with a corresponding
decrease in trade accounts receivable. 

Our
primary sources for liquidity come from existing cash on hand and
cash generated from operations. We believe we have sufficient
liquidity available to fund our operations for the next twelve
months. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by
operations was $691,000, compared to cash provided by operating
activities of $1,347,000 for the comparable prior year period. The
decrease in cash provided from operations is primarily due to lower
net income, the timing of payments from our customers and the
timing of payments to our vendors. 

17 

Cash
used in investing activities totaled $471,000 and $168,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with
both periods reflecting the capitalization of internally developed
software and purchase of hardware. 

Cash
used in financing activities totaled $11,000 and $18,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
reflecting  payments on equipment
notes and capital leases, primarily using cash provided by
operations . 

OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our
critical accounting policies are described in the audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015,
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on March 22, 2016. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that are material to investors.
