   Forward-looking statements and information     
     
  This quarterly report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should,   could,   seeks,   intends,   plans,   estimates,   anticipates  or other comparable terms.

   Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industries in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

   NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
    Nature of Business    
     
  HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (  Holdings  ) indirectly owns all of the outstanding common stock of HD Supply, Inc. ( HDS ).  
     
  Holdings, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including HDS ( HD Supply  or the  Company ), is one of the largest industrial distribution companies in North America. The Company specializes in three distinct market sectors: Maintenance, Repair   Operations; Infrastructure; and Specialty Construction. Through approximately 500 locations across 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces, the Company serves these markets with an integrated go-to-market strategy. HD Supply has approximately 14,000 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. The Company serves approximately 500,000 customers, which include contractors, maintenance professionals, industrial businesses, and government entities. HD Supply s broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include more than 800,000 stock-keeping units ( SKUs ) of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire life-cycle of a project from infrastructure and construction to maintenance, repair and operations.  
     
  HD Supply is managed primarily on a product line basis and reports results of operations in three reportable segments. The reportable segments are Facilities Maintenance, Waterworks, and Construction   Industrial - White Cap. In addition to the reportable segments, the consolidated financial statements include an operating segment, Home Improvement Solutions, and Corporate, which is comprised of enterprise-wide functional departments.  
     
    Basis of Presentation    
     
  In management s opinion, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed.  Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year.  Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be the same as those for the full year.  For a more complete discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies and other information, you should read this report in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016, which includes all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Certain amounts in the prior-period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation.  
     
   F iscal Year    
     
  HD Supply s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31.  Fiscal years ending January 29, 2017 ( fiscal 2016 ) and January 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2015 ) both include 52 weeks.  The three months ended October 30, 2016 ( third quarter 2016 ) and November 1, 2015 ( third quarter 2015 ) both include 13 weeks. The nine months ended October 30, 2016 and November 1, 2015 both include 39 weeks.  
     
    Principles of Consolidation    
     
  The consolidated financial statements of Holdings present the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including HDS. The consolidated financial statements of HD Supply, Inc. present the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of HDS. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Results of operations of businesses acquired are included from their respective dates of acquisition. The results of operations of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

    Estimates    
     
  Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
     
    Self-Insurance    
     
  HD Supply has a high deductible insurance program for most losses related to general liability, product liability, environmental liability, automobile liability and workers  compensation, and is self-insured for medical claims and certain legal claims. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. Self-insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical loss development experience.  At October 30, 2016 and January 31, 2016, self-insurance reserves totaled approximately $85 million and $84 million, respectively.  
     
   NOTE 2   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   
     
  In May 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Interior Solutions business. Including the final working capital settlement in September 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $26 million, net of $2 million of transaction costs. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a $10 million pre-tax loss.

   NOTE 3   DEBT   
     
  HDS s long-term debt as of October 30, 2016 and January 31, 2016 consisted of the following (dollars in millions):  

(1)                                      Represents the stated rate of interest, without including the effect of discounts or premiums.  
     
  On October 14, 2016, HDS entered into a Fourth Amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) to the credit agreement governing HDS s existing Term Loan Facility, as defined below. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, HDS amended its existing Term Loan Facility to, among other things, (i) eliminate its London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) floor by means of a replacement tranche that replaced all of the Company s outstanding term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $842 million (the  Term B-1 Loans ) and (ii) issue a new tranche of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million (the  Term B-2 Loans ).  
     
  Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Term B-1 Loans bear interest at the applicable margin for borrowings of 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings, with no LIBOR floor. The Term B-1 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the replaced tranche with the balance payable on the maturity date, August 13, 2021.  
     
  The Term B-2 Loans bear interest at the applicable margin for borrowings of 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings, with no LIBOR floor. The Term Loan Facility allows for a reduction to the applicable margin on the Term B-2 Loans from 2.75% per annum to 2.50% per annum upon the Company reaching a consolidated total leverage ratio of 3.0x or less.  The Term B-2 Loans will amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount and will mature on October 17, 2023.  
     
  On October 17, 2016, HDS used the proceeds from the Term B-2 Loans, together with cash on hand and available borrowings under HDS s Senior ABL Facility, to redeem all of the outstanding $1,275 million aggregate principal of the 7.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 (the  February 2013 Senior Unsecured Notes ), and pay a $48 million premium in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such notes. As a result, the Company incurred a $59 million loss on extinguishment of the debt, which includes the $48 million premium and write-off of $11 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
  On April 11, 2016, HDS issued $1,000 million of 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (the  April 2016 Senior Unsecured Notes ) at par. HDS received approximately $985 million, net of transaction fees. The

  transaction fees of $15 million are reflected as deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the notes.  
     
  On April 27, 2016, HDS used the net proceeds from the April 2016 Senior Unsecured Notes issuance, together with available cash, to redeem all of the outstanding $1,000 million aggregate principal of the 11.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 (the  October 2012 Senior Unsecured Notes ), and pay a $106 million make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such notes and pay $4 million of accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. As a result, the Company incurred a $115 million loss on extinguishment of the debt, which includes the $106 million make-whole premium and the write-off of $9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
   Senior Credit Facilities   
     
   Asset Based Lending Facility   
     
  HDS s Senior Asset Based Lending Facility due 2018 ( Senior ABL Facility ) provides for senior secured revolving loans and letters of credit of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million (subject to availability under a borrowing base).  Extensions of credit under the Senior ABL Facility are limited by a borrowing base calculated periodically based on specified percentages of the value of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable, subject to certain reserves and other adjustments.  A portion of the Senior ABL Facility is available for letters of credit and swingline loans. As of October 30, 2016, HDS had $960 million of additional available borrowings under the Senior ABL Facility (after giving effect to the borrowing base limitations and approximately $30 million in letters of credit issued and including $364 million of borrowings available on qualifying cash balances).  
     
  At HDS s option, the interest rates applicable to the loans under the Senior ABL Facility are based (i) in the case of U.S. dollar-denominated loans, either at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, or Prime Rate plus an applicable margin and (ii) in the case of Canadian dollar-denominated loans, either the banker s acceptance ( BA ) rate plus an applicable margin, or the Canadian Prime Rate plus an applicable margin. The margins applicable for each elected interest rate are subject to a pricing grid, as defined in the agreement governing the Senior ABL Facility, based on average excess availability for the previous fiscal quarter. The Senior ABL Facility also contains a letter of credit fee computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Senior ABL Facility agreement) then in effect for LIBOR Loans (as defined in the Senior ABL Facility agreement) and an unused commitment fee subject to a pricing grid, included in the agreement governing the Senior ABL Facility, based on the Average Daily Used Percentage (as defined in the agreement).  
     
  The Senior ABL Facility also permits HDS to add one or more incremental term loan facilities to be included in the Senior ABL Facility or one or more revolving credit facility commitments to be included in the Senior ABL Facility. The Senior ABL Facility will mature on June 28, 2018 (or the maturity date under HDS s Term Loan Facility, if earlier).  
     
   Senior Secured Term Loan Facility   
     
  HDS s Senior Term Facility consists of a senior secured term loan facility (the   Term Loan Facility,   and the term loans thereunder, the   Term Loans  ) providing for Term Loans in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,392 million, comprised of two tranches, Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans, with aggregate principal amounts of $842 million and $550 million, respectively. Term B-1 Loans will mature on August 13, 2021 (the   Term B-1 Loans Maturity Date  ) and Term B-2 Loans will mature on October 17, 2023 (the  Term B-2 Loans Maturity Date ). Both Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans with the balances payable on their respective Maturity Dates. Both Term B-1 Loans and Term B-2 Loans bear interest at the applicable margin for borrowings of 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings. The Term Loan Facility

   NOTE 4   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   
     
  The fair value measurements and disclosure principles of GAAP (ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and provide disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.  These principles define a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  
     
  Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
     
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;  
     
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists.  
     
  The Company s financial instruments that are not reflected at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows as of October 30, 2016 and January 31, 2016 (amounts in millions):  

(1) These amounts do not include accrued interest; accrued interest is classified as Other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts do not include any related discounts, premiums, or deferred financing costs.   
     
  The Company utilized Level 2 inputs, as defined in the fair value hierarchy, to measure the fair value of the long-term debt.  Management s fair value estimates were based on quoted prices for recent trades of HDS s long-term debt, recent similar credit facilities initiated by companies with like credit quality in similar industries, quoted prices for similar instruments, and inquiries with certain investment communities.  
     
   NOTE 5   INCOME TAXES   
     
  For the nine months ended October 30, 2016, the Company s combined federal, state, and foreign effective tax rate is an expense of 39.9%. The effective rate for continuing operations for the nine months ended November 1, 2015 was a benefit of 82.0%, mainly driven by a decrease of $189 million in the Company s unrecognized U.S. federal and state tax benefits related to the Joint Committee on Taxation s February 19, 2015 approval and finalization of the Company s tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service s Office of Appeals in conjunction with a Revenue Agent s Report issued in January 2013.

  The Company s effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where it operates, restructuring and other one-time charges, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits.  
     
  As of January 31, 2016, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the income taxes principles of GAAP (ASC 740,  Income Taxes ) were $9 million. As of October 30, 2016, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1 million to $10 million. The Company s ending net accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2016 was zero and remained unchanged as of October 30, 2016.  At October 30, 2016 and January 31, 2016, the Company s valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets was approximately $4 million and $6 million, respectively. Each reporting period management assesses available positive and negative evidence and estimates if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets.  
     
   NOTE 6   BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES

   NOTE 8   RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES   
     
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 in conjunction with the sale of the Power Solutions business unit, management evaluated the Company s talent alignment and functional support strategies. Consequently, during fiscal 2015, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to strategically align its leadership and functional support teams. Initially, the Company expected to incur approximately $10 million to $20 million of restructuring charges under the plan.  During first quarter fiscal 2016, the Company accelerated and expanded the restructuring plan. As a result, the Company now expects to incur a total of approximately $25 million to $30 million of restructuring charges under the restructuring plan, which is expected to be complete in fiscal 2016 and deliver a payback of approximately two years via a reduction in costs.  
     
  During the three and nine months ended October 30, 2016, the Company s activities under this restructuring plan resulted in restructuring charges of $4 million and $16 million, respectively, of which $2 million and $11 million, respectively, was incurred at the Facilities Maintenance business. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $9 million of restructuring charges under this plan. The Company expects to incur up to an additional $5 million of restructuring charges over the next three months primarily for severance, relocation and related costs.  
     
  The following table presents the activity for the liability balance, included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (amounts in millions):  

NOTE 9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
     
   Legal Matters   
     
  HD Supply is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Company establishes reserves for litigation and similar matters when those matters present loss contingencies that it determines to be both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC 450,  Contingencies.  In the opinion of management, based on current knowledge, all reasonably estimable and probable matters are believed to be adequately reserved for or covered by insurance and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For all other matters, except as noted below, management believes the possibility of losses from such matters is not probable,

  the potential loss from such matters is not reasonably estimable, or such matters, if disposed of unfavorably to the Company, are of such kind or involve such amounts that would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. For material matters that are reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, including matters that are probable and estimable but for which the amount that is reasonably possible is in excess of the amount that the Company has accrued for, management has estimated the aggregate range of potential loss as $0 to $15 million. If a material loss is probable or reasonably possible, and in either case estimable, the Company has considered it in the analysis and it is included in the discussion set forth above.  
     
   NOTE 10   SEGMENT INFORMATION

   (Unaudited)   
     
  HDS that do not guarantee the Notes ( Non-guarantor Subsidiaries ) are direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of HDS and primarily include HDS s operations in Canada.  
     
  The Debt Issuer s payment obligations under the Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and all guarantees are full and unconditional.  
     
  These guarantees are subject to release under the circumstances as described below:  
     
  (i)                            concurrently with any direct or indirect sale or disposition (by merger or otherwise) of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any interest therein in accordance with the terms of the applicable indebtedness by HDS or a restricted subsidiary, following which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a restricted subsidiary of HDS; 
     
  (ii)                         at any time that such Subsidiary Guarantor is released from all of its obligations under all of its guarantees of payment of any indebtedness of HDS or any Subsidiary Guarantor under all other indebtedness and is not a borrower under the Senior ABL Facility; 
     
  (iii)                      upon the merger or consolidation of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into HDS or another Subsidiary Guarantor that is the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to HDS or another Subsidiary Guarantor; 
     
  (iv)                     concurrently with any Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an unrestricted subsidiary; 
     
  (v)                        during the period when the rating on the Notes is changed to investment grade and certain covenants cease to apply while such investment grade rating is maintained, upon the merger or consolidation of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into another subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor with such other subsidiary being the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation, or upon liquidation of such Subsidiary Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to a subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; 
     
  (vi)                     upon legal or covenant defeasance of HDS s obligations under the applicable indebtedness, or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture governing the applicable indebtedness; or 
     
  (vii)                  subject to customary contingent reinstatement provisions, upon payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of all applicable indebtedness then outstanding and all other obligations guaranteed by a Subsidiary Guarantor then due and owing. 
     
  In addition, HDS has the right, upon 30 days  notice to the applicable trustee, to cause any Subsidiary Guarantor that has not guaranteed payment of any indebtedness of HDS or any Subsidiary Guarantor under all other indebtedness and is not a borrower under the Senior ABL Facility to be unconditionally released from all obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantee shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and of no further force or effect.  
     
  In connection with the issuance of the Notes, HDS determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X. In lieu of providing separate audited financial statements for the Guarantor Subsidiaries, HDS has included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(f) of SEC Regulation S-X. The following supplemental financial information sets forth, on a consolidating basis under the equity method of accounting, the condensed statements of operations and comprehensive income, the condensed balance sheets and the condensed statements of cash flows for the Debt Issuer, for the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Non-guarantor Subsidiaries and total consolidated Debt Issuer and subsidiaries (amounts in millions).

   NOTE 12   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
     
   Statement of Cash Flows     In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  ( ASU 2016-18 ). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future. 
     
   Income Taxes     In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory  ( ASU 2016-16 ). The new guidance is intended to improve the accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory by requiring recognition of income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16. 
     
   Statement of Cash Flows     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
     
   Stock Compensation     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09. 
     
   Leases     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new guidance requires companies to recognize all leases as assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. It is to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02. 
     
   Inventory     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ). The amended guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amended guidance is limited to inventory measured using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods and excludes inventory measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or retail inventory methods. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
     
   Revenue recognition     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from contracts with customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), amended by ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  and ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amended guidance outlines

  a single comprehensive revenue model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The guidance supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt the guidance. In July 2015, the FASB provided a one-year delay in the effective date of ASU 2014-09, to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.  
     
   NOTE 13   SUBSEQUENT EVENT   
     
  On November 28, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of the former Facilities Maintenance corporate building in San Diego, California. The Company received approximately $30 million in cash proceeds, net of transaction fees, and expects to record an estimated gain on sale of approximately $10 million.

MANAGEMENT S   DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         
 
   HD SUPPLY               
     
   Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
     
   Overview   
     
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is combined for two registrants: HD Supply Holdings, Inc. and HD Supply, Inc.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, any reference in this discussion and analysis to  Holdings  refers to HD Supply Holdings, Inc., any reference to  HDS  refers to HD Supply, Inc., the indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, and any references to  HD Supply,  the  Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Holdings together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including HDS.  
     
  HD Supply is one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. We believe we have leading positions in the three distinct market sectors in which we specialize: Maintenance, Repair   Operations ( MRO  Infrastructure; and Specialty Construction. We serve these markets with an integrated go-to-market strategy. We operate through approximately 500 locations across 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. We have approximately 14,000 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. We serve approximately 500,000 customers, which include contractors, maintenance professionals, industrial businesses, and government entities. Our broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include more than 800,000 stock-keeping units ( SKUs ) of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire lifecycle of a project from infrastructure and construction to maintenance, repair and operations.  
     
   Description of segments   
     
  We operate our Company through three reportable segments: Facilities Maintenance, Waterworks, and Construction   Industrial - White Cap.  
     
    Facilities Maintenance.                      Facilities Maintenance distributes MRO products, provides value-add services and fabricates custom products. The markets that Facilities Maintenance serves include multifamily, hospitality, healthcare and institutional facilities. Products include electrical and lighting items, plumbing, HVAC products, appliances, janitorial supplies, hardware, kitchen and bath cabinets, window coverings, textiles and guest amenities, healthcare maintenance and water and wastewater treatment products. 
     
    Waterworks.     Waterworks distributes complete lines of water and wastewater transmission products, serving contractors and municipalities in the water and wastewater industries for residential and non-residential uses.  Waterworks serves non-residential, residential, water systems, sewage systems and other markets. Products include pipes, fittings, valves, hydrants and meters for use in the construction, maintenance and repair of water and wastewater systems as well as fire-protection systems. Waterworks has complemented its core products through additional offerings, including smart meters (AMR/AMI), HDPE pipes and specific engineered treatment plant products and services. 
     
    Construction   Industrial - White Cap.                                   Construction   Industrial - White Cap distributes specialized hardware, tools and engineered materials to non-residential and residential contractors. Products include tilt-up brace systems, forming and shoring systems, concrete chemicals, hand and power tools, cutting tools, rebar, ladders, safety and fall arrest equipment, specialty screws and fasteners, sealants and adhesives, drainage pipe, geo-synthetics, erosion and sediment control equipment and other engineered materials used broadly across all types of non-residential and residential construction. 
     
  In addition to the reportable segments, our consolidated financial results include   Corporate   Other.   Corporate   Other include the operating segment Home Improvement Solutions, which offers light remodeling and construction supplies, kitchen and bath cabinets, windows, plumbing materials, electrical equipment and other products, primarily to small remodeling contractors and trade professionals. Corporate   Other also includes costs related to our centralized support functions, which are comprised of finance, information technology, human resources, legal, supply chain and other support services, and removes inter-segment transactions.

MANAGEMENT S   DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         
 
   HD SUPPLY               
     
   Discontinued operations   
     
  In May 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Interior Solutions business. Including the final working capital settlement in September 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $26 million, net of $2 million of transaction costs. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a $10 million pre-tax loss.  
     
  In October 2015, the Company completed the sale of its Power Solutions business. Including the final working capital settlement in May 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $812 million, net of $16 million of transaction costs. As a results of the sale, the Company recorded a $189 million pre-tax gain.  
     
   The presentation of discontinued operations includes revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations, net of tax, as one line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Prior periods presented have been revised to reflect this presentation.  For additional detail related to the results of operations of the discontinued operations, see  Note 2, Discontinued Operations,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
     
   Seasonality   
     
  In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects.  
     
   Fiscal Year   
     
  HD Supply s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31.  Fiscal years ending January 29, 2017 ( fiscal 2016 ) and January 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2015 ) both include 52 weeks.  The three months ended October 30, 2016 ( third quarter 2016 ) and November 1, 2015 ( third quarter 2015 ) both include 13 weeks. The nine months ended October 30, 2016 and November 1, 2015 both include 39 weeks.  
     
   Key business metrics   
     
    Net sales    
     
  We earn our Net sales primarily from the sale of construction, infrastructure, maintenance and renovation and improvement related products and our provision of related services to approximately 500,000 customers, including contractors, government entities, maintenance professionals and industrial businesses. We recognize sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns and discounts, when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Net sales in certain business units, particularly Waterworks, fluctuate with the price of commodities as we seek to minimize the effects of changing commodities prices by passing such increases in the prices of certain commodity-based products to our customers.  
     
  We ship products to customers by internal fleet and by third-party carriers. Net sales are recognized from product sales when title to the products is passed to the customer, which generally occurs at the point of destination for products shipped by internal fleet and at the point of shipping for products shipped by third-party carriers.  
     
  We include shipping and handling fees billed to customers in Net sales. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight are capitalized to inventories and relieved through Cost of sales as inventories are sold. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
    Gross profit    
     
  Gross profit primarily represents the difference between the product cost from our suppliers (net of earned rebates and discounts) including the cost of inbound freight and the sale price to our customers. The cost of outbound freight, purchasing, receiving and warehousing are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses within operating expenses. Our Gross profits may not be comparable to those of other companies, as other companies may include all of the costs related to their distribution network in Cost of sales.

   HD SUPPLY               
     
    Operating expenses    
     
  Operating expenses are primarily comprised of Selling, general and administrative costs, which include payroll expenses (salaries, wages, employee benefits, payroll taxes and bonuses), outbound freight, rent, insurance, utilities, repair and maintenance and professional fees. In addition, operating expenses include depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges.  
     
    Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income    
     
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not recognized terms under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and do not purport to be alternatives to Net income as a measure of operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income because each is a primary measure used by management to evaluate operating performance. In addition, we present Adjusted net income to measure our overall profitability as we believe it is an important measure of our performance. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income enhances our investors  overall understanding of the financial performance of our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are helpful in highlighting operating trends, because each excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of operating management and that can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, age and book depreciation of facilities and capital investments  
     
  Adjusted EBITDA is based on   Consolidated EBITDA,   a measure which is defined in HDS s Term Loan Facility and Senior ABL Facility and used in calculating financial ratios in several material debt covenants. Borrowings under these facilities are a key source of liquidity and our ability to borrow under these facilities depends upon, among other things, our compliance with such financial ratio covenants. In particular, both facilities contain restrictive covenants that can restrict our activities if we do not maintain financial ratios calculated based on Consolidated EBITDA. Our Senior ABL Facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 if our specified excess availability (including an amount by which our borrowing base exceeds the outstanding amounts) under the Senior ABL Facility falls below the greater of $150 million and 10% of the aggregate commitments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) less Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, plus (i) Interest expense and Interest income, net, (ii) Provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) Depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash items and certain other adjustments to Consolidated Net Income, including costs associated with capital structure enhancements, permitted in calculating Consolidated EBITDA under our Term Loan Facility and our Senior ABL Facility. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about how the covenants in those agreements operate and about certain non-cash and other items. The Term Loan Facility and Senior ABL Facility permit us to make certain additional adjustments to Consolidated Net Income in calculating Consolidated EBITDA, such as projected net cost savings, which are not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA data presented in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We may in the future reflect such permitted adjustments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA. These covenants are important to the Company as failure to comply with certain covenants would result in a default under our Senior Credit Facilities. The material covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.  
     
  Adjusted net income is defined as Net income (loss) less Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt and certain non-cash, non-recurring, non-operational, or unusual items, net of tax.  
     
  We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted net income measure when reporting their results. We compensate for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

   HD SUPPLY               
     
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:  
     
                        Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
     
                        Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
     
                        Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
     
                        Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and 
     
                        although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

  Net sales in third quarter 2016 increased $66 million, or 3.4%, as compared to third quarter 2015. Each of our three reportable segments realized increases in Net sales. Operating income in third quarter 2016 increased $4 million, or 1.8%, as compared to third quarter 2015. Net income in third quarter 2016 decreased $190 million, to $60 million as compared to third quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2016 increased $1 million, or 0.4%, as compared to third quarter 2015. Adjusted net income in third quarter 2016 increased $37 million, or 28.2%, as compared to third quarter 2015 as a result of the improvement in operating income and decline in interest expense. As of October 30, 2016, our total liquidity was $873 million. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources   External Financing  for further information.  
     
  In May 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Interior Solutions business, a provider  of turnkey supply and installation services for multiple interior finish options. Including the final working capital settlement in September 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $26 million, net of $2 million of transaction costs. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a $10 million pre-tax loss, reflected in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
     
   For additional information, see  Note 2, Discontinued Operations,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within  Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
     
  As a result of the sale of the Power Solutions business unit in October 2015, management evaluated our talent alignment and functional support strategies. Consequently, during fiscal 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan to strategically align our leadership and functional support teams. Initially, we expected to incur approximately $10 million to $20 million of restructuring charges under the plan.  During first quarter fiscal 2016, we accelerated and expanded the restructuring plan. As a result, we now expect to incur a total of approximately $25 million to $30 million of restructuring charges under the restructuring plan, which we expect to complete in fiscal 2016 and deliver a payback of approximately two years via a reduction in costs.

  During the three and nine months ended October 30, 2016, our activities under this restructuring plan resulted in restructuring charges of $4 million and $16 million, respectively, of which $2 million and $11 million, respectively, was incurred at the Facilities Maintenance business. During fiscal 2015, we incurred $9 million of restructuring charges under this plan. We expect to incur an up to an additional $5 million of restructuring charges over the next three months primarily for severance, relocation and related costs. For additional information, see  Note 8, Restructuring Activities,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
     
   Net sales   
     
  Net sales in third quarter 2016 increased $66 million, or 3.4%, compared to third quarter 2015, and $266 million, or 4.8%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.  
     
  Each of our reportable segments experienced an increase in Net sales in third quarter 2016 and in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. The Net sales increases were primarily due to growth initiatives at each of our businesses and increases in market volume. Growth initiatives contributed approximately $30 million and $138 million in third quarter 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively. The Net sales increase during the first nine of months of fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate, resulting in a $3 million reduction to Net sales.  
     
   Gross profit   
     
  Gross profit increased $35 million, or 5.4%, during third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $117 million, or 6.3%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.  
     
  Each of our reportable segments experienced an increase in Gross profit in third quarter 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. The Gross profit increases, in both periods, were primarily due to sales growth from initiatives and increased market volume.  
     
  Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales ( gross margin ) increased approximately 60 basis points to 34.0% in third quarter 2016 as compared to 33.4% in third quarter 2015 and increased approximately 50 basis points to 34.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to 33.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The improvement in gross margin in both periods was primarily driven by our category management initiatives, partially offset by the competitive environment.  
     
   Operating expenses   
     
  Operating expenses increased $31 million, or 7.4%, during third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $77 million, or 6.2%, during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.  
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 8.4%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $75 million, or 6.4%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The increase in both periods was primarily a result of increases in variable expenses due to higher sales volume, increased investments in growth initiatives, primarily additional personnel, increased healthcare costs, and supply chain investments at Facilities Maintenance. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2 million, or 7.7%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $10 million, or 12.3%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to timing of in-service projects. In addition, restructuring charges were flat in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $12 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015 as the Company continued restructuring activities to strategically align its workforce, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 in conjunction with the sale of Power Solutions.  
     
  Operating expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased approximately 80 basis points to 22.5% in third quarter 2016 and increased approximately 30 basis points to 22.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 21.1% in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased approximately 30 basis points to 21.3% as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The increase in both periods was primarily a result of the increased investments in growth initiatives, increased

  healthcare costs, and supply chain corrective action at Facilities Maintenance, partially offset by the decline in depreciation and amortization expense.  
     
   Operating income   
     
  Operating income increased $4 million, or 1.8%, during third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $40 million, or 6.6%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The improvement in both periods was primarily due to higher Net sales and Gross profit partially offset by higher operating expenses.  
     
  Operating income as a percentage of Net sales decreased approximately 20 basis points during third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased approximately 20 basis points during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The decrease in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 was primarily due to an increase in Selling, general   administrative expenses, partially offset by improvements in gross margin. The improvement in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015 was driven primarily by improvements in gross margins offset by the increase in Selling, general   administrative expenses.  
     
   Interest expense   
     
  Interest expense decreased $34 million, or 34.3%, during third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $92 million, or 29.6%, during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The decrease in both periods was due to a lower average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness due to debt refinancing transactions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, and a lower average outstanding balance as we continue to use cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of businesses to reduce indebtedness.  
     
   Loss on extinguishment   modification of debt   
     
  During third quarter 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal 2016, our debt refinancing and redemption activities resulted in charges of $59 million and $174 million, respectively, recorded in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
  On October 17, 2016, HDS redeemed all of the outstanding $1,275 million aggregate principal of the 7.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 (the  February 2013 Senior Unsecured Notes ), incurring a $59 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included a $48 million premium payment and a write-off of $11 million of unamortized deferred financing costs.  
     
  On April 27, 2016, HDS redeemed all of the outstanding $1,000 million aggregate principal of its 11.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 (the  October 2012 Senior Unsecured Notes ) incurring a $115 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included a $106 million make-whole premium payment and a write-off of $9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs.  
     
  During third quarter 2015 and the first nine months of fiscal 2015, our debt refinancing and redemption activities resulted in charges of $100 million. These charges were recorded in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
  On October 13, 2015, HDS redeemed all of the outstanding $675 million aggregate principal of its April 2012 Second Priority Notes incurring an $80 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included a $72 million make-whole premium payment and a write-off of $8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs.  
     
  On August 13, 2015, HDS amended its Term Loan Facility to reduce the applicable margin for borrowing by 25 basis points, with the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) floor to remain at 1.00%. The amendment also extended the maturity of the Term Loans by approximately three years to August 13, 2021. As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded a $20 million loss on extinguishment and modification of debt, which included a $15 million write-off of pro-rata portions of the unamortized original issue discount and the unamortized deferred financing costs for the portion of the amendment considered an extinguishment in accordance with GAAP.

   Provision (benefit) for income taxes   
     
  The provision (benefit) for income taxes during the period is calculated by applying an estimated annual tax rate for the full fiscal year to pre-tax income for the reported period plus or minus unusual or infrequent discrete items occurring within the period. The Company s income tax provision (benefit) recorded in interim periods can move from an income tax provision to income tax benefit (and vice versa) in situations in which the Company is experiencing changes between interim pre-tax income to pre-tax loss (and vice versa). The provision for income taxes from continuing operations in third quarter 2016 was an expense of $43 million compared to a $13 million expense in third quarter 2015. The provision for income taxes in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was an expense of $101 million compared to a $159 million benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2015.  
     
  The effective rate for continuing operations for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 was an expense of 40.2% and 39.9%, respectively. The effective rate for continuing operations for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 was an expense of 46.4% and a benefit of 82.0%, respectively, mainly driven by a decrease of $189 million in the Company s unrecognized U.S. federal and state tax benefits related to the Joint Committee on Taxation s February 19, 2015 approval and finalization of the Company s tentative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service s Office of Appeals in connection with a Revenue Agent s Report issued in January 2013. For additional information, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. In addition, the Company s rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 was impacted by the utilization of deferred tax assets which had previously been subject to a valuation allowance, increasing the deferred tax liability for U.S. goodwill amortization for tax purposes, and the accrual of income taxes for foreign and certain state jurisdictions.  
     
  We regularly assess the realization of our net deferred tax assets and the need for any valuation allowance.  This assessment requires management to make judgments about the benefits that could be realized from future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors influencing the realization of deferred tax assets.  At October 30, 2016 and January 31, 2016, the Company s valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets was approximately $4 million and $6 million, respectively.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
  Adjusted EBITDA increased $1 million, or 0.4%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015, and $43 million, or 6.1%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. Waterworks and Construction   Industrial   White Cap both experienced an increase in Adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015. Facilities Maintenance experienced a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2016 and the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015.  
     
  Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales decreased approximately 40 basis points to 13.1% in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased approximately 20 basis points to 13.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The decrease in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by improvement in gross profit. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the increase in Gross margin partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales.  
     
   Adjusted net income   
     
   Adjusted net income increased $37 million, or 28.2%, in  third  quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $146 million, or 49.3%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015. The increase in Adjusted net income for both periods was attributable to the sales growth, improving gross margins, and lower interest expense.

  Net sales increased $8 million, or 1.1%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $58 million, or 2.8%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.  
     
  The increase in Net sales was primarily due to growth initiatives. These growth initiatives consisted of investments in sales personnel, products, and technology aligned with our customers  multifamily, hospitality, and healthcare industries. The Net sales increase was partially offset by suboptimal inventory forecasting, and certain operational and distribution challenges from the second half of fiscal 2015. Management implemented improvements within the supply chain; however, we expect the impact to continue into the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
   Adjusted EBITDA  decreased $9 million, or 6.0%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $2 million, or 0.5%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.  
     
  The decrease in both periods was primarily due to increased Selling, general and administrative expenses related to expenses incurred for supply chain investments and the hiring of additional associates to support the expanding business and future growth.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales decreased approximately 150 basis points in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and approximately 70 basis points in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015 . The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales due to expenses incurred for supply chain corrective action.

  Growth initiatives, including meters, storm drainage, and treatment plants contributed to the increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016. Net sales was also positively impacted by higher sales volume due to end-market improvements, partially offset by a decline in Polyvinyl chlorides ( PVC ) pipe pricing.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
   Adjusted EBITDA  increased $4 million, or 5.7%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $11 million, or 6.1%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2015.  
     
   The increase in the  third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, was due to growth initiatives, partially offset by increased Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by personnel costs related to hiring additional associates to support growth initiatives, variable costs due to the increased volume, and inflation.  
     
  Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales increased approximately 20 basis points in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and approximately 10 basis points in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales is the result of improvements in gross margin partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, due to investing in growth initiatives.

Net Sales   
     
  Net sales increased $27 million, or 5.7%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and $101 million, or 7.6%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2015.  
     
   Growth initiatives contributed to the increase in Net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 driven by new locations (  greenfields ), managed sales approach (  MSA  ) and direct marketing initiatives. MSA is a structured approach to drive revenue at a regional level through analysis, tools and sales management. In addition, Net sales was positively impacted by end-market improvement in both non-residential and residential construction markets. The Net sales increase during the first nine of months of fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate, resulting in a $2 million reduction to Net sales.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
   Adjusted EBITDA  increased $9 million, or 17.6%, in third quarter 2016 as compared to third quarter 2015 and increased $33 million, or 25.4%, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2015.  
     
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in both periods was primarily driven by growth initiatives, gross margin expansion, and market volume. This increase was partially offset by increased Selling, general and administrative expenses related to variable expenses and the hiring of additional associates to support the expanding business and drive future growth.

The increase in both periods was driven by improvements in gross margins, due to product mix and category management initiatives, and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales due to the leverage of fixed costs through sales volume increases and cost control efforts.  
     
   Liquidity and capital resources   
     
   Sources and uses of cash   
     
  Our sources of funds, primarily from operations, cash on-hand, and, to the extent necessary, from readily available external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet all current obligations on a timely basis. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet the operating needs of our business for at least the next twelve months.  
     
  During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, the Company s generation of cash was primarily driven by cash receipts from operations, the sale of a business, and proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by net debt repayments including premiums and make-whole payments to call or redeem debt prior to maturity, the payment of interest on debt, capital expenditures and purchases of treasury shares.  
     
  As of October 30, 2016, our combined liquidity of approximately $873 million was comprised of $146 million in cash and cash equivalents and $727 million of additional available borrowings (excluding $364 million of borrowings on available cash balances) under our Senior ABL Facility, based on qualifying inventory and receivables.  
     
  Information about the Company s cash flows, by category, is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is summarized as follows:  
     
   Net cash provided by (used for):   

Working capital   
     
  Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, was $1,036 million as of October 30, 2016, increasing $12 million as compared to $1,024 million as of November 1, 2015.  Excluding the impact of discontinued operations, working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents, increased $27 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in business growth, resulting in increases in Receivables and Inventory, offset by increases in Accounts Payable. Additionally, working capital increased due to lower Accrued Interest as a result of debt refinancings and extinguishments.  
     
   Operating activities   
     
  During the first nine months of fiscal 2016 cash provided by operating activities was $304 million compared to $173 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. Cash interest paid in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $249 million, compared to $354 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. Cash flows used in operating activities for discontinued operations were $3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 and cash flows provided by operating activities for discontinued operations were $31 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. Excluding the cash interest payments in both periods, cash flows from operating activities for continuing operations increased approximately $60 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2015. The increase in operating cash flows excluding interest and discontinued operations is attributable to growth in earnings of continuing operations and working capital efficiency.

  During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, cash used in financing activities was $399 million, primarily due to net debt repayments of $378 million including premiums and make-whole payments to call or redeem debt prior to maturity, payments for debt issuance costs of $19 million and purchases of treasury shares of $24 million, partially offset by proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $23 million.  
     
  During the first nine months of fiscal 2015, cash used in financing activities was $930 million, primarily due to net debt repayments of $929 million including premiums and make-whole payments to call or redeem debt prior to maturity and purchases of treasury shares of $51 million, partially offset by $55 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.  
     
   External Financing   
     
  As of October 30, 2016, we had an aggregate principal amount of $4,097 million of outstanding indebtedness, net of unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs of $12 million and $43 million, respectively, and $960 million of additional available borrowings under our Senior ABL Facility (after giving effect to the borrowing base limitations and approximately $30 million in letters of credit issued and including $364 million of borrowings available on qualifying cash balances).  From time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, the Company may seek to repay, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. We may make such repurchases in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  
     
  On October 14, 2016, HDS entered into a Fourth Amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) to the credit agreement governing HDS s existing Term Loan Facility, as defined below. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, HDS amended its existing Term Loan Facility to among other things, (i) eliminate its LIBOR floor by means of a replacement tranche that replaced all of the Company s outstanding term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $842 million (the  Term B-1 Loans ) and (ii) issue a new tranche of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million (the  Term B-2 Loans ).  
     
  Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Term B-1 Loans bear interest at the applicable margin for borrowings of 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings, with no LIBOR floor. The Term B-1 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of the replaced tranche with the balance payable on the maturity date, August 13, 2021.  
     
  The Term B-2 Loans bear interest at the applicable margin for borrowings of 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings, with no LIBOR floor. The Term Loan Facility allows for a reduction to the applicable margin on the Term B-2 Loans from 2.75% per annum to 2.50% per annum upon the Company reaching a consolidated total leverage ratio of 3.0x or less.  The Term B-2 Loans will amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount and will mature on October 17, 2023.  
     
  On October 17, 2016 HDS used the proceeds from the Term B-2 Loans, together with cash on hand and available borrowings under HDS s Senior ABL Facility, to redeem all of the outstanding $1,275 million aggregate principal of the February 2013 Senior Unsecured Notes, and pay a $48 million premium in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such notes. As a result, the Company incurred a $59 million loss on extinguishment of the debt, which includes the $48 million premium and write-off of $11 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
  On April 11, 2016, HDS issued $1,000 million of 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (the  April 2016 Senior Unsecured Notes ) at par. HDS received approximately $985 million, net of transaction fees. The

  transaction fees of $15 million are reflected as deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the notes.  
     
  On April 27, 2016, HDS used the net proceeds from the April 2016 Senior Unsecured Notes issuance, together with available cash, to redeem all of the outstanding $1,000 million aggregate principal of the October 2012 Senior Unsecured Notes, and pay a $106 million make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such notes and pay $4 million of accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. As a result, the Company incurred a $115 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which includes the $106 million make-whole premium and the write-off of $9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, in accordance with ASC 470-50,  Debt   Modifications and Extinguishments.   
     
  For additional information, see  Note 3, Debt,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
     
   Rating agency actions   
     
  In March 2016, Moody s Investor Service ( Moody s ) upgraded HDS s corporate family rating to B1, from B2. Moody s cited our solid operating performance and lower level of balance sheet debt. In a related rating action, Moody s raised HDS s Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating to SGL-1 from SGL-2, citing their expectations of increasing free cash flows and the amount of revolving credit facility availability. Moody s rating outlook remains at positive. Also in March 2016, Standard   Poor s ( S P ) raised HDS s corporate credit rating to  BB-  from  B+ , and revised its rating outlook to positive from stable.  
     
  In September 2016, Moody s Investor s Service downgraded HDS s secured debt to B1 from Ba3. Moody s cited our reconfigured capital debt structure due to the October 2016 refinancing actions taken. Moody s maintained its Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating at SGL-1, citing their expectations that operating cash flows are sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and capital expenditures to support ongoing demand and growth initiatives. Also in September 2016, S P assigned a BB issue-level rating for our Term B-2 Loans. S P maintained its overall outlook as positive.  
     
   Critical accounting policies   
     
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements. The Company s critical accounting policies have not changed from those reported in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.  
     
   Recent accounting pronouncements   
     
   Statement of Cash Flows     In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  ( ASU 2016-18 ). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future. 
     
   Income Taxes     In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory  ( ASU 2016-16 ). The new guidance is intended to improve the accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory by requiring recognition of income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this updated should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16.

   HD SUPPLY               
     
   Statement of Cash Flows     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
     
   Stock Compensation     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09. 
     
   Leases     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new guidance requires companies to recognize all leases as assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. It is to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02. 
     
   Inventory     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ). The amended guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amended guidance is limited to inventory measured using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost methods and excludes inventory measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or retail inventory methods. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
     
   Revenue recognition     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from contracts with customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), amended by ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  and ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amended guidance outlines a single comprehensive revenue model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The guidance supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt the guidance. In July 2015, the FASB provided a one-year delay in the effective date of ASU 2014-09, to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.

   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     
     
  We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and certain commodity prices.  To reduce these risks, we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures as compared to those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.

   (a)              Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  
     
    HD Supply Holdings, Inc.    
     
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of HD Supply Holdings, Inc., we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

   (b)              Changes in internal control  
     
  There were no changes in Holdings  or HDS s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Holdings  or HDS s internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings     
     
  HD Supply is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Company establishes reserves for litigation and similar matters when those matters present loss contingencies that it determines to be both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC 450,  Contingencies.  In the opinion of management, based on current knowledge, all reasonably estimable and probable matters are believed to be adequately reserved for or covered by insurance and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For all other matters, except as noted below, management believes the possibility of losses from such matters is not probable, the potential loss from such matters is not reasonably estimable, or such matters are of such kind or involve such amounts that would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company if disposed of unfavorably. For material matters that are reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, including matters that are probable and estimable but for which the amount that is reasonably possible is in excess of the amount that the Company has accrued for, management has estimated the aggregate range of potential loss as $0 to $15 million. If a material loss is probable or reasonably possible, and in either case estimable, the Company has considered it in the analysis and it is included in the discussion set forth above.

   Item 1A. Risk Factors     
     
  We discuss in our filings with the SEC various risks that may materially affect our business. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.  
     
  The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in forward-looking statements contained in this report together with those previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 and our and HDS s other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  See  Forward-looking statements and information  at the beginning of this report.  
     
   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     
     
  (c) Purchases of Equity Securities  
     
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Holdings  Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to be funded from cash proceeds received from exercises of employee stock options, as was disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 25, 2014. This share repurchase program does not obligate Holdings to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be terminated at any time at Holdings  discretion.  
     
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in each fiscal month of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 are set forth in the table below:  
     
   ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES   

(1)                                The total dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased increases by the amount of cash proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options as they occur.  
     
  During the nine months ended October 30, 2016, Holdings retired 449,717 shares of its common stock ( Retired Shares ) held as treasury shares by Holdings in the amount of $14 million. All of these shares were repurchased by Holdings pursuant to the previously authorized share repurchase program. Holdings reinstated the Retired Shares to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, effective as of the date of retirement. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 505-30,  Equity-Treasury Stock,  Holdings reversed the $0.01 par value of the Retired Shares and the excess of the cost of the Retired Shares over par value to Retained Earnings.

   FOURTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  , dated as of October 14, 2016 (this   Agreement  ), among HD Supply, Inc. (the   Borrower  ), the Guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the   Administrative Agent  ), Bank of America, N.A. as a Term B-1 Lender and Term B-2 Lender, and the other Lenders party hereto (collectively, the   Lenders  ). 
     
  WHEREAS , reference is hereby made to the Credit Agreement dated as of April 12, 2012 (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of February 15, 2013, the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of February 6, 2014, and the Incremental Agreement No. 1 dated as of August 13, 2015, the   Credit Agreement   and as amended by this Agreement, the   Amended Credit Agreement  ) among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the financial institutions party thereto.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Amended Credit Agreement; 
     
  WHEREAS , the Borrower has requested to amend the Credit Agreement (the   Amendments  ) to, among other things (i) refinance all of the Borrower s outstanding Term Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement and herein referred to as the   Existing Term Loans  ) with a new Tranche of term loans (herein referred to as the   Term B-1 Loans  ) in an aggregate principal amount of $841.5 million and (ii) issue a new Tranche of term loans (herein referred to as the   Term B-2 Loans  ) in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million; 
     
  WHEREAS, upon the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, each Term Loan Lender (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that shall have executed and delivered a consent attached as  Exhibit A  hereto (a   Consent  ) under the  Cashless Settlement Option  (each, a   Cashless Option Lender  ) shall be deemed to have consented to the Amendments (as described in Section 1 of this Agreement, including modifying the Credit Agreement to permit the redemption of the 7.50% Senior Unsecured Notes notwithstanding the limitation set forth in Section 7.5(b)(ii) of the Credit Agreement, and shall be deemed to have converted all (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may allocate) of its Existing Term Loans (which Existing Term Loans shall thereafter no longer be deemed to be outstanding) for Term B-1 Loans in the same aggregate principal amount as such Term Loan Lender s (as defined in the Credit Agreement) Existing Term Loans (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may allocate), and such Term Loan Lender (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall thereafter be a  Term B-1 Lender  under the Amended Credit Agreement;

faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP.

  2.4                                   Record of Loans . 
     
  (a)                                    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Loan Lender, the amount specified in subsection 2.2(b) (or such earlier date on which the applicable Term Loans become due and payable pursuant to Section 8).  The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the applicable Term Loans 
     
 61   

made to the Borrower from time to time outstanding from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates  per annum , and on the dates, set forth in subsection 3.1.  
     
  (b)                                    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. 
     
  (c)                                     The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to subsection 10.6(b), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and each Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender s share thereof. 
     
  (d)                                    The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to subsection 2.4(b) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be  prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded;  provided ,  however , that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
     
  2.5                                   Incremental Facilities . 
     
  (a)                                    So long as no Event of Default under subsection 8(a) or (f) exists or would arise therefrom, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, (i) to request new term loan commitments under one or more new term loan credit facilities to be included in this Agreement (the   Incremental Term Loan Commitments  ), (ii) to increase the loans in any Tranche by requesting new term loan commitments to be added to an existing Tranche of Loans (the   Supplemental Term Loan Commitments  ), (iii) to request new commitments under one or more new revolving facilities to be included in this Agreement (the   Incremental Revolving Commitments  ), and (iv) to request new letter of credit facility commitments under one or more new letter of credit facilities to be included in this Agreement (together with the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, Supplemental Term Loan Commitments and the Incremental Revolving Commitments, the   Incremental Commitments  ),  provided  that, after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, (i) the aggregate principal amount of Incremental Commitments permitted pursuant to this subsection 2.5 is limited, at the time the respective Incremental Commitment becomes effective, to (A) the aggregate principal amount (not less than zero) of Indebtedness that is permitted to be Incurred under subsection 7.1(b)(xiv)(i) by the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries at such time plus (B) $250 million and (ii) if any portion of an Incremental Commitment is to be incurred in reliance on subsection 7.1(b)(xiv)(i), the Borrower shall have delivered a certificate to the Administrative Agent, certifying compliance with the financial test set forth in such clause (together with calculations demonstrating compliance with such ratio).  Any loans made in respect of any such Incremental Commitment (other than Supplemental Term Loan Commitments) shall be made by creating a new Tranche.  Each Incremental Commitment under any Term Loan Facility made available pursuant to this subsection 2.5 shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of at least $15,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
     
  (b)                                    Each request from the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.5 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Commitments.  The Incremental Commitments (or any portion thereof) may be made by any existing Lender or by any other bank or financial 
     
 62   

institution (any such existing Lender and any such bank or other financial institution, an   Additional Lender  ),  provided , if such Additional Lender is not already a Lender hereunder or an Affiliate of a Lender hereunder, to the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the consent of any swingline lender or issuing lender, as the case may be, that may then be required pursuant to subsection 10.6 (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (it being understood that any such Additional Lender that is an Affiliated Lender shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 10.6(h),  mutatis mutandis , to the same extent as if such Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been obtained by such Lender by way of assignment).  
     
  (c)                                     Supplemental Term Loan Commitments shall become commitments under this Agreement pursuant to a supplement specifying the Tranche to be increased, executed by the Borrower and each increasing Lender substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit O  (the   Increase Supplement  ) or by each Additional Lender that is not an existing Lender substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit P  (the   Lender Joinder Agreement  ), as the case may be, which shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent for recording in the Register.  Upon effectiveness of the Lender Joinder Agreement each Additional Lender shall be a Lender, and the term loan made pursuant to such Supplemental Term Loan Commitment shall be a Loan under the applicable Tranche, for all intents and purposes of this Agreement. 
     
  (d)                                    Incremental Commitments (other than Supplemental Term Loan Commitments) shall become commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an   Incremental Commitment Amendment  ) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower and each Additional Lender.  An Incremental Commitment Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this subsection 2.5,  provided ,  however , that (i) (A) the Incremental Commitments will not be guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the Borrower other than the Subsidiary Guarantors, and will be secured on a pari passu or (at the Borrower s option) junior basis by the same Collateral securing the Term Loans, (B) the Incremental Commitments and any incremental loans drawn thereunder (the   Incremental Loans  ) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with or (at the Borrower s option) junior to the Term Loans and (C) no Incremental Commitment Amendment may provide for (I) any Incremental Commitment or any Incremental Loans to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Loan Party that do not also secure the Term Loans and (II) so long as any Term Loans are outstanding, any mandatory prepayment provisions that do not also apply to the applicable Term Loans (other than Incremental Term Loans secured on a junior basis by the Collateral or ranking junior in right of payment, which shall be subject to junior prepayment provisions) on a  pro rata  basis (or otherwise provide for more favorable prepayment treatment for such Term Loans than such Incremental Loans), provided that any Incremental Loans constituting Initial Term Loan Refinancing Debt may provide for more favorable amortization payments than the applicable Term Loans); (ii) no Lender will be required to provide any such Incremental Commitment unless it so agrees; (iii) the maturity date and the weighted average life to maturity of such Incremental Commitments shall be no earlier than or shorter than, as the case may be, the Maturity Date or the weighted average life to maturity of the Term B-2 Loans (other than (a) any Incremental Commitments and related Incremental Term Loans constituting Initial Term Loan Refinancing Debt that may provide for an earlier maturity date and/or a shorter average life to maturity than the Term B-2 Loans, and (b) an earlier maturity date and/or shorter weighted average life to maturity for customary bridge financings, that, subject to customary conditions, would either be automatically converted into or required to be exchanged for permanent financing which does not provide for an earlier maturity date or a shorter weighted average life to maturity than the Maturity Date of the Term B-2 Loans or the weighted average life to maturity of the Term B-2 Loans, as applicable); (iv) the interest rate margins applicable to the loans made pursuant to the Incremental Commitments, 
     
 63   

and the amortization schedule applicable to any Incremental Term Loans, shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable Additional Lenders;  provided  that, in the event that the applicable interest rate margins for any term loans Incurred by the Borrower under any Incremental Term Loan Commitment are higher than the applicable interest rate margin for any Term Loans by more than 50 basis points, then the Applicable Margin for such Term Loans shall be increased to the extent necessary so that the applicable interest rate margin for such Term Loans is equal to the applicable interest rate margins for such Incremental Term Loan Commitment minus 50 basis points;  provided further  that, in determining the applicable interest rate margins for the Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans, (A) original issue discount (  OID  ) or upfront fees payable generally to all participating Additional Lenders in lieu of OID (which shall be deemed to constitute like amounts of OID) payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under such Term Loans or any Incremental Term Loan in the initial primary syndication thereof shall be included (with OID being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity); (B) any arrangement, structuring or other fees payable in connection with the Incremental Term Loans that are not shared with all Additional Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans shall be excluded; (C) any amendments to the Applicable Margin on any Term Loans that became effective subsequent to the Fourth Amendment Effective Date but prior to the time of such Incremental Term Loans shall also be included in such calculations and (D) if the Incremental Term Loans include an interest rate floor greater than the interest rate floor applicable to such Term Loans, such increased amount shall be equated to the applicable interest rate margin for purposes of determining whether an increase to the Applicable Margin for such Term Loans shall be required, to the extent an increase in the interest rate floor for such Term Loans would cause an increase in the interest rate then in effect thereunder, and in such case the interest rate floor (but not the Applicable Margin) applicable to such Term Loans shall be increased by such amount; ( v ) such Incremental Commitment Amendment may provide (1) for the inclusion, as appropriate, of the Additional Lenders in any required vote or action of the Required Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or of the Lenders of each Tranche hereunder, (2) class voting and other class protections for any additional credit facilities, (3) for the amendment of the definitions of  Additional Permitted Obligations  and  Refinancing Indebtedness  and subsection 7.8(b), in each case only to extend the maturity date and the weighted average life to maturity requirements, from the Maturity Date of such Term Loans and weighted average life to maturity of such Term Loans to the extended maturity date and the weighted average life to maturity of such Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, and (4) in the case of an Incremental Revolving Commitment, add, or provide for adjustments to, the definition of  Agent Default,   Defaulting Lender  protections and appropriate modifications to subsection 2.7 to provide for  amend and extend  mechanics for Incremental Revolving Commitments (and related Obligations), in each case on terms agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing such Commitments (including any swingline lender or issuing lender); and (vi) the other terms and documentation in respect thereof, to the extent not consistent with this Agreement as in effect prior to giving effect to the Incremental Commitment Amendment, shall otherwise be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.  
     
  2.6                                   Permitted Debt Exchanges .

 64   

are satisfied:  (i) such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes do not provide for a maturity date or weighted average life to maturity earlier than the Maturity Date of the Term Loans or shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loans, (ii) except as may be otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Lenders participating in the applicable Permitted Debt Exchange, the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of Loans exchanged shall equal the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of Permitted Debt Exchange Notes issued in exchange for such Loans, (iii) the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of all Loans exchanged by the Borrower pursuant to any Permitted Debt Exchange shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrower on the date of the settlement thereof (and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, any applicable exchanging Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, or such other form as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in respect thereof pursuant to which the respective Lender assigns its interest in the Loans being exchanged pursuant to the Permitted Debt Exchange to the Borrower for immediate cancellation), (iv) if the aggregate principal amount of all Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof) tendered by Lenders in respect of the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer (with no Lender being permitted to tender a principal amount of Loans which exceeds the principal amount of the applicable Tranche actually held by it) shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans offered to be exchanged by the Borrower pursuant to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer, then the Borrower shall exchange Loans subject to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer tendered by such Lenders ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts so tendered, (v) each such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall be made on a  pro rata  basis to the Lenders (other than any Lender that, if requested by the Borrower, is unable to certify that it is either a  qualified institutional buyer  (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) or an institutional  accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act)) based on their respective aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Loans of the applicable Tranche, (vi) so long as any Term Loans are outstanding, the terms of such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes shall not provide for any mandatory or voluntary pre-payment provisions applicable to the Permitted Debt Exchange Notes that do not also apply to the Term Loans on a pro rata basis (or otherwise provide for more favorable prepayment treatment for Term Loans than such Permitted Debt Exchange Notes), (vii) all documentation in respect of such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications generally directed to the Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and made in consultation with the Administrative Agent, and (viii) any applicable Minimum Exchange Tender Condition shall be satisfied.  
     
  (b)                                    With respect to all Permitted Debt Exchanges effected by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.6, (i) such Permitted Debt Exchanges (and the cancellation of the exchanged Loans in connection therewith) shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of subsection 3.4 and (ii) such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall be made for not less than $15 million in aggregate principal amount of Loans,  provided  that subject to the foregoing clause (ii), the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a   Minimum Exchange Tender Condition  ) to consummating any such Permitted Debt Exchange that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer in the Borrower s discretion) of Loans be tendered. 
     
  (c)                                     In connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten Business Days  (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, acting reasonably, shall mutually agree to such procedures as may be necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this subsection 2.6 and without conflict with subsection 2.6(d);  provided  that the terms of any Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall provide that the date by which the relevant Lenders are required 
     
 65   

to indicate their election to participate in such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be not less than five Business Days following the date on which the Permitted Debt Exchange Offer is made.  
     
  (d)                                    The Borrower shall be responsible for compliance with, and hereby agrees to comply with, all applicable securities and other laws in connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, it being understood and agreed that (x) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender assumes any responsibility in connection with the Borrower s compliance with such laws in connection with any Permitted Debt Exchange (other than the Borrower s reliance on any certificate delivered by a Lender pursuant to subsection 2.6(a) above for which such Lender shall bear sole responsibility) and (y) each Lender shall be solely responsible for its compliance with any applicable  insider trading  laws and regulations to which such Lender may be subject under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
     
  2.7                                   Extension of Term Loans . 
     
  (a)                                    The Borrower may at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion of the Loans of one or more Tranches (including any Extended Term Loans) or of any commitments existing at the time of such request (each, an   Existing Term Tranche   and the Loans of such Tranche, the   Existing Term Loans  ) be converted to extend the termination date thereof and the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of any Existing Term Tranche (any such Existing Term Tranche which has been so extended, an   Extended Term Tranche   and the Loans of such Tranche, the   Extended Term Loans  ) and to provide for other terms consistent with this subsection 2.7;  provided  that (i) any such request shall be made by the Borrower to all Lenders with Term Loans with a like maturity date (whether under one or more Tranches) on a  pro rata  basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable Term Loans), and (ii) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Borrower.  In order to establish any Extended Term Tranche, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders of the applicable Existing Term Tranche) (an   Extension Request  ) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Tranche to be established, which terms shall be identical to those applicable to the Existing Term Tranche from which they are to be extended (the   Specified Existing Term Tranche  ), except (x) all or any of the final maturity dates of such Extended Term Tranches may be delayed to later dates than the final maturity dates of the Specified Existing Term Tranche and (y) (A) the interest rates and interest margins with respect to the Extended Term Tranche may be higher or lower than the interest margins (including through fixed interest rates) for the Specified Existing Term Tranche and/or (B) additional fees may be payable to the Lenders providing such Extended Term Tranche in addition to or in lieu of any increased margins contemplated by the preceding clause (A), in each case to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment;  provided  that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection 2.7 or otherwise, (1) assignments and participations of Extended Term Tranches shall be governed by the same or, at the Borrower s discretion, more restrictive assignment and participation provisions applicable to the Term Loans set forth in subsection 10.6 and (2) no repayment of Extended Term Tranches shall be permitted unless such repayment is accompanied by an at least pro rata repayment of all earlier maturing Tranches (including Extended Term Tranches) (or all earlier maturing Tranches (including Extended Term Tranches) shall otherwise be or have been terminated and repaid in full).  No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Existing Term Loans or, if applicable, commitments of any Existing Term Tranche converted into an Extended Term Tranche pursuant to any Extension Request.  Any Extended Term Tranche shall constitute a separate Tranche of Loans (and, if applicable, commitments) from the Specified Existing Term Tranches and from any other Existing Term Tranches (together with any other Extended Term Tranches so established on such date). 
     
 66   

(b)                                    The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Tranche or Existing Term Tranches are requested to respond.  Any Lender (an   Extending Lender  ) wishing to have all or a portion of its Specified Existing Term Tranche converted into an Extended Term Tranche shall notify the Administrative Agent (each, an   Extension Election  ) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Specified Existing Term Tranche that it has elected to convert into an Extended Term Tranche.  In the event that the aggregate amount of the Specified Existing Term Tranche subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Term Tranches requested pursuant to the Extension Request, the Specified Existing Term Tranches subject to Extension Elections shall be converted to Extended Term Tranches on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Specified Existing Term Tranches included in each such Extension Election. 
     
  (c)                                     Extended Term Tranches shall be established pursuant to an amendment (an   Extension Amendment  ) to this Agreement (which may include amendments to (i) provisions related to maturity or interest margins or fees referenced in clauses (x) and (y) of subsection 2.7(a), (ii) the definitions of  Additional Permitted Obligations  and  Refinancing Indebtedness  and subsection 7.8(b) to extend the maturity date and the weighted average life to maturity requirements, from the Maturity Date of the Term Loans and weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loans to the extended maturity date and the weighted average life to maturity of such Extended Term Tranche, as applicable, and which, in each case, except to the extent expressly contemplated by the penultimate sentence of this subsection 2.7(c) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in subsection 10.1, shall not require the consent of any Lender other than the Extending Lenders with respect to the Extended Term Tranches established thereby) executed by the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and the Extending Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without limiting the generality or applicability of subsection 10.1 to any Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendments, any Extension Amendment may provide for additional terms and/or additional amendments other than those referred to or contemplated above (any such additional amendment, a   Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendment  ) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;  provided  that such Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendments do not become effective prior to the time that such Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendments have been consented to (including, without limitation, pursuant to consents applicable to holders of any Extended Term Tranches provided for in any Extension Amendment) by such of the Lenders, Loan Parties and other parties (if any) as may be required in order for such Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendments to become effective in accordance with subsection 10.1; provided,  further , that no Extension Amendment may provide for (i) any Extended Term Tranche to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Loan Party that does not also secure the Existing Term Tranches and (ii) so long as any Existing Term Tranches are outstanding, any mandatory or voluntary prepayment provisions that do not also apply to the Existing Term Tranches (other than Existing Term Tranches secured on a junior basis by the Collateral or ranking junior in right of payment, which may be subject to junior prepayment provisions) on a pro rata basis (or otherwise provide for more favorable prepayment treatment for Existing Term Tranches than such Extended Term Tranches).  It is understood and agreed that each Lender has consented for all purposes requiring its consent, and shall at the effective time thereof be deemed to consent to each amendment to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents authorized by this subsection 2.7 and the arrangements described above in connection therewith except that the foregoing shall not constitute a consent on behalf of any Lender to the terms of any Subsection 2.7 Additional Amendment. 
     
  (d)                                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, on any date on which any Existing Term Tranche is converted to extend the related scheduled maturity date(s) in accordance with clause (a) above (an   Extension Date  ), in the case of the Specified Existing Term Tranche of each Extending Lender, the aggregate principal amount of such Specified Existing Term 
     
 67   

Tranche shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Term Tranche so converted by such Lender on such date, and such Extended Term Tranches shall be established as a separate Tranche from the Specified Existing Term Tranche and from any other Existing Term Tranches (together with any other Extended Term Tranches so established on such date).  
     
  (e)                                     If, in connection with any proposed Extension Amendment, any Lender declines to consent to the applicable extension on the terms and by the deadline set forth in the applicable Extension Request (each such other Lender, a   Non-Extending Lender  ) then the Borrower may, on notice to the Administrative Agent and the Non-Extending Lender, (i) replace such Non-Extending Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to subsection 10.6 (with the assignment fee and any other costs and expenses to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees;  provided  that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender;  provided ,  further , that the applicable assignee shall have agreed to provide Extended Loans and/or a commitment on the terms set forth in such Extension Amendment; and  provided ,  further , that all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Non-Extending Lender relating to the Existing Term Loans so assigned shall be paid in full (including the applicable premium that would be payable under subsection 3.4(a) if it were a voluntary prepayment) by the assignee Lender to such Non-Extending Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Acceptance or (ii) upon notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay the Existing Term Loans, in whole or in part, subject to subsection 3.4(a) and 3.12, without premium or penalty.  In connection with any such replacement under this subsection 2.7, if the Non-Extending Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance and/or any other documentation necessary to reflect such replacement by the later of (A) the date on which the replacement Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance and/or such other documentation and (B) the date as of which all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Non-Extending Lender relating to the Existing Term Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such Non-Extending Lender, then such Non-Extending Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance and/or such other documentation as of such date and the Borrower shall be entitled (but not obligated) to execute and deliver such Assignment and Acceptance and/or such other documentation on behalf of such Non-Extending Lender. 
     
  (f)                                      Following any Extension Date, with the written consent of the Borrower, any Non-Extending Lender may elect to have all or a portion of its Existing Term Loans deemed to be an Extended Term Loan under the applicable Extended Term Tranche on any date (each date a   Designation Date  ) prior to the maturity date of such Extended Term Tranche;  provided  that (i) such Lender shall have provided written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at least 10 Business Days prior to such Designation Date (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) and (ii) no more than three Designation Dates may occur in any one year period without the written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Following a Designation Date, the Existing Term Loans held by such Lender so elected to be extended will be deemed to be Extended Term Loans of the applicable Extended Term Tranche, and any Existing Term Loans held by such Lender not elected to be extended, if any, shall continue to be  Existing Term Loans  of the applicable Tranche. 
     
  (g)                                     With respect to all extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.7, (i) such extensions shall not constitute optional or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of subsection 3.4 (except as set forth in clause (e) above) and (ii) no Extension Request is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment,  provided  that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a   Minimum Extension Condition  ) to consummating any such extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Request in the Borrower s 
     
 68   

sole discretion and may be waived by the Borrower) of Existing Term Loans of any or all applicable Tranches be extended.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this subsection 2.7 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Request) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, subsections 3.4 and 3.8) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this subsection 2.7.

  3.2                                   Conversion and Continuation Options . 
     
  (a)                                    The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert applicable outstanding Loans from Eurocurrency Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days  prior irrevocable notice of such election,  provided  that any such conversion of Eurocurrency Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert outstanding Loans from ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days  prior irrevocable notice of such election.  Any such notice of conversion to Eurocurrency Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender under the applicable Term Loan Facility thereof.  All or any part of outstanding Eurocurrency Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as provided herein,  provided  that (i) (unless the Required 
     
 69   

Lenders otherwise consent) no Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has given notice to the Borrower that no such conversions may be made and (ii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Maturity Date.  
     
  (b)                                    Any Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice to the Administrative Agent of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loan, determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term  Interest Period  set forth in subsection 1.1,  provided  that no Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such (i) (unless the Required Lenders otherwise consent) when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has given notice to the Borrower that no such continuations may be made or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the Maturity Date, and  provided ,  further , that, if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this subsection 3.2(b) or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso, such Eurocurrency Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.  Upon receipt of any such notice of continuation pursuant to this subsection 3.2(b), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender under the applicable Term Loan Facility thereof. 
     
  3.3                                   Minimum Amounts of Sets .  All borrowings, conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loans comprising each Set shall be equal to $5.0 million or a whole multiple of $1.0 million in excess thereof, and so that there shall not be more than 15 Sets at any one time outstanding. 
     
  3.4                                   Optional and Mandatory Prepayments . 
     
  (a)                                    The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Term Loans under any Term Loan Facility made to it in whole or in part, subject to subsection 3.12, without premium or penalty, in each case upon at least three Business Days  notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (in the case of Eurocurrency Loans), and at least one Business Day s notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (in the case of ABR Loans).  Such notice shall specify the applicable Term Loan facility and/or Tranche, the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if a combination thereof, the principal amount allocable to each.  Any such notice may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event specified therein (including the effectiveness of other credit facilities), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Upon the receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender under the applicable Term Loan Facility thereof.  If any such notice is given and is not revoked, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (if a Eurocurrency Loan is prepaid other than at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto) any amounts payable pursuant to subsection 3.12 and accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid.  Partial prepayments of Loans pursuant to this subsection 3.4(a) shall be applied to the respective installments of principal of such Term Loans in such order as the Borrower may direct.  Partial prepayments pursuant to this subsection 3.4(a) shall be in multiples of $1.0 million;  provided that , notwithstanding the foregoing, any Loan may be prepaid in its entirety.  Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 3.4(a) to the contrary, if on or prior to the date that is six months after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date the Borrower makes an optional prepayment of the applicable Term B-2 Loans pursuant to a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Lender, a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount 
     
 70   

of such Term B-2 Loans being prepaid. If, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower effects an amendment of this Agreement that results in a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Term B-2 Lender, a fee equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans of such Lender outstanding immediately prior to the date of effectiveness of such Amendment.  
     
   (b)            On or before the date that is fifteen Business Days following the 90th day after the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower ending on or about February 1, 2018 (each, an   ECF Payment Date  ), the Borrower shall, in accordance with subsections 3.4(d) and (e), prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to (A) (x) the ECF Percentage of (i) the Borrower s Excess Cash Flow for the immediately preceding fiscal year  minus  (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans prepaid pursuant to subsection 3.4(a), and any loans under the ABL Facility prepaid to the extent accompanied by a corresponding permanent commitment reduction under such facility, in each case during such fiscal year excluding prepayments funded with proceeds from the Incurrence of long-term Indebtedness,  minus  (y) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans prepaid pursuant to subsection 3.4(a), and any loans under the ABL Facility prepaid to the extent accompanied by a corresponding permanent commitment reduction under such facility, in each case since the end of such fiscal year and on or prior to such ECF Payment Date, excluding prepayments funded with proceeds from the Incurrence of long-term Indebtedness (in the case of this clause (y), without duplication of any amount thereof previously deducted in any calculation pursuant to this subsection 3.4(b) for any prior ECF Payment Date) (the amount described in this clause (A), the   ECF Prepayment Amount  )  minus  (B) the portion of such ECF Prepayment Amount applied (to the extent the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary is required by the terms thereof) to prepay, repay or purchase other Permitted Additional Indebtedness on a pro rata basis with the Term Loans.  For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subsection 3.4(b), proceeds from the Incurrence of long-term Indebtedness shall not be deemed to include proceeds from the Incurrence of Indebtedness under the ABL Facility, any Special Purpose Financing or any other revolving credit or working capital financing permitted to be incurred pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
     
   (c)            The Borrower shall, in accordance with subsections 3.4(d) and (e), prepay the Term Loans to the extent required by subsection 7.4(b) (subject to the last sentence of each of subsections 7.4(b)(A) and 7.4(b)(B).   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the previous sentence or in any other provision of this Agreement (including subsection 7.4(b)) or of any other Loan Document, upon prior written notice to the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection 3.4(e) below, the Borrower may elect to withhold up to $500 million (in the aggregate) from prepayments otherwise required by the previous sentence and subsection 7.4(b) and to apply such amount instead to the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Indebtedness (including by way of tender offer, voluntary redemption, and open market purchases), and such amount so applied shall, for purposes of subsection 7.5(b)(ii)(v), be deemed to be a declined amount as contemplated by subsection 3.4(e). 
     
   (d)            Prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to subsections 3.4(b), (c) and (j) shall be applied to installments of principal thereof pursuant to subsection 2.2(b) as directed by the Borrower  (or, in the case of no direction, in the direct order of maturity).  
     
   (e)            The Borrower shall give notice to the Administrative Agent of any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans (x) pursuant to subsection 3.4(b), ten Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is due and (y) pursuant to subsection 3.4(c), within five Business Days upon becoming obligated to make such prepayment.  Such notice shall state that the Borrower is offering to make such mandatory prepayment (x) on a date that is ten Business Days after the date of such notice in the case of any prepayment pursuant to subsection 3.4(b), or (y) on or before the date specified in subsection 3.4(c), in the case of a prepayment pursuant to subsection 3.4(c) (any such date of prepayment, a  
     
 71   

Prepayment Date  ).  Once given, such notice shall be irrevocable and all amounts subject to such notice shall be due and payable on the relevant Prepayment Date as required by subsection 3.4 (except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this subsection 3.4(e)).  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall immediately give notice to each Lender of the prepayment and the relevant Prepayment Date.  In the case of any prepayment pursuant to subsection 3.4(b) or (c), each Lender may (in its sole discretion) elect to decline any such prepayment by giving notice of such election in writing to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date that is three Business Days prior to the Prepayment Date.  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall immediately notify the Borrower of such election.  Any amount so declined by any Lender may, at the option of the Borrower, be applied to pay or prepay the Term Loans of Lenders not declining such prepayment in the manner described in subsection 3.4(d), or other obligations under the other Credit Facilities, or otherwise be retained by the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries or applied by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in any manner not inconsistent with this Agreement, including subsection 7.4(b).  
     
   (f)             Amounts prepaid on account of Term Loans pursuant to subsection 3.4(a), (b), (c) or (j) may not be reborrowed.  
     
   (g)            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 3.4, (x) if at any time any prepayment of any Eurocurrency Loans pursuant to subsection 3.4(a), (b), (c) or (j) would result, after giving effect to the procedures set forth in this Agreement, in the Borrower incurring breakage costs under subsection 3.12 as a result of such Eurocurrency Loans being prepaid other than on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, then the Borrower may, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in its sole discretion, initially (i) deposit a portion (up to 100.0%) of the amounts that otherwise would have been paid in respect of such Eurocurrency Loans with the Administrative Agent (which deposit must be equal in amount to the amount of such Eurocurrency Loans not immediately prepaid), to be held as security for the obligations of the Borrower to make such prepayment pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with such cash collateral to be directly applied upon the first occurrence thereafter of the last day of an Interest Period with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans (or such earlier date or dates as shall be requested by the Borrower) or (ii) make a prepayment of the Term Loans in accordance with subsection 3.4(a) with an amount equal to a portion (up to 100.0%) of the amounts that otherwise would have been paid in respect of such Eurocurrency Loans (which prepayment, together with any deposits pursuant to clause (i) above, must be equal in amount to the amount of such Eurocurrency Loans not immediately prepaid);  provided that , in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), such unpaid Eurocurrency Loans shall continue to bear interest in accordance with subsection 3.1 until such unpaid Eurocurrency Loans or the related portion of such Eurocurrency Loans, as the case may be, have or has been prepaid and (y) if at any time, the financing of any portion of any prepayment of Loans pursuant to subsections 3.4(b) or 3.4(c) would require the transfer of funds from any Foreign Subsidiary to the Borrower and, in the good faith determination of the Borrower (which determination shall be conclusive), the transfer thereof directly or indirectly to the Borrower could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in any material adverse tax consequence for the Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, the prepayment otherwise required under subsections 3.4(b) or 3.4(c) shall be reduced to the extent of the amount of the prepayment that would otherwise be financed with the transfer of funds from such Foreign Subsidiary.  
     
  (h)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this subsection 3.4  may be amended (and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such amendments) to the extent necessary to reflect differing amounts payable, and priorities of payments, to  
     
 72   

Lenders participating in any new classes or tranches of Term Loans added pursuant to, and without the consent of any Person except as set forth in, subsections 2.5 and 2.7, as applicable.  
     
  (i)            Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, so long as no Event of Default under subsection 8(a) or (f) has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may prepay the outstanding Loans on the following basis:  
     
  (i)            The Borrower shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of Loans at a discount to par (such prepayment, the   Discounted Term Loan Prepayment  ) pursuant to a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, a Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers, or a Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, in each case made in accordance with this subsection 3.4(i);  provided  that the Borrower shall not initiate any action under this subsection 3.4(i) in order to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment unless (1) at least ten Business Days shall have passed since the consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment as a result of a prepayment made by the Borrower on the applicable Discounted Prepayment Effective Date or (2) at least three Business Days shall have passed since the date the Borrower was notified that no Lender was willing to accept any prepayment of any Loan at the Specified Discount, within the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the case of Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, the date of the Borrower s election not to accept any Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers made by a Lender.  Any Loans prepaid pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) shall be immediately and automatically cancelled.  
     
  (ii)            Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment .  
     
  (a)           The Borrower may from time to time offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by providing the Administrative Agent with three Business Days  notice in the form of a Specified Discount Prepayment Notice;  provided  that (I) any such offer shall be made available, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such offer shall specify the aggregate Outstanding Amount offered to be prepaid (the   Specified Discount Prepayment Amount  ), the Tranche(s) of Loans subject to such offer and the specific percentage discount to par value (the   Specified Discount  ) of the Outstanding Amount of such Loans to be prepaid, (III) the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5.0 million and whole increments of $500,000, and (IV) each such offer shall remain outstanding through the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date.  The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified Discount Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each such Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Borrower) (the   Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date  ).  
     
  (b)           Each relevant Lender receiving such offer shall notify the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date whether or not it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its relevant then outstanding Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so (such accepting Lender, a   Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender  ), the amount of such Lender s Outstanding Amount and Tranches of Loans to be prepaid at such offered discount.  Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender shall be irrevocable.  Any Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not  
     
 73   

received by the Administrative Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept such Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.  
     
  (c)           If there is at least one Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the Borrower will make prepayment of outstanding Loans pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i)(ii) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender in accordance with the respective Outstanding Amount and Tranches of Loans specified in such Lender s Specified Discount Prepayment Response given pursuant to the foregoing clause (b);  provided  that, if the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Loans accepted for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders exceeds the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount, such prepayment shall be made  pro rata  among the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders in accordance with the respective Outstanding Amounts accepted to be prepaid by each such Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the   Specified Discount Proration  ).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three Business Days following the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date, notify (I) the Borrower of the respective Lenders  responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (II) each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranches of all Loans to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date, and (III) each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the Specified Discount Proration, if any, and confirmation of the Outstanding Amount, Tranche and Type of Loans of such Lender to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.  The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection 3.4(i)(vi) below (subject to subsection 3.4(i)(x) below).  
     
  (iii)           Borrower Solicitation of Discount Range Prepayment Offers .  
     
  (a)           The Borrower may from time to time solicit Discount Range Prepayment Offers by providing the Administrative Agent with three Business Days  notice in the form of a Discount Range Prepayment Notice;  provided  that (I) any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount of the relevant Loans that the Borrower is willing to prepay at a discount (the   Discount Range Prepayment Amount  ), the Tranche(s) of Loans subject to such offer and the maximum and minimum percentage discounts to par (the   Discount Range  ) of the Outstanding Amount of such Loans willing to be prepaid by the Borrower, (III) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5.0 million and whole increments of $500,000, and (IV) each such solicitation by the Borrower shall remain outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date.  The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding relevant Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date as may be designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Borrower) (the   Discount Range Prepayment Response Date  ).  Each relevant Lender s Discount Range Prepayment Offer  
     
 74   

shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount to par within the Discount Range (the   Submitted Discount  ) at which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of any or all of its then outstanding Loans and the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Loans such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Submitted Discount (the   Submitted Amount  ).  Any Lender whose Discount Range Prepayment Offer is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment of any of its Loans at any discount to their par value within the Discount Range.  
     
  (b)           The Administrative Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by it by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and will determine (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this subsection 3.4(i)(iii).  The Borrower agrees to accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Administrative Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from the Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par, up to and including the Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range (such Submitted Discount that is the smallest discount to par being referred to as the   Applicable Discount  ) which yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate Outstanding Amount equal to the lesser of (I) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts.  Each Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a discount to par that is larger than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Loans equal to its Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following subsection 3.4(i)(iii)(c)) at the Applicable Discount (each such Lender, a   Participating Lender  ).  
     
  (c)           If there is at least one Participating Lender, the Borrower will prepay the respective outstanding Loans of each Participating Lender in the aggregate Outstanding Amount and of the Tranches specified in such Lender s Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable Discount;  provided  that if the Submitted Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at a discount to par greater than the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the Outstanding Amount of the relevant Loans for those Participating Lenders whose Submitted Discount is a discount to par greater than or equal to the Applicable Discount (the   Identified Participating Lenders  ) shall be made  pro rata  among the Identified Participating Lenders in accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the   Discount Range Proration  ).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly, and in any case within three Business Days following the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, notify (w) the Borrower of the respective Lenders  responses to such solicitation, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (x) each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of all Loans to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (y) each Participating Lender of the aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Lender to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, and (z) if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender of the Discount Range Proration.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be   
     
 75   

conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.  The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by such Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection 3.4(i)(vi) below (subject to subsection 3.4(i)(x) below).  
     
  (iv)           Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers .  
     
  (a)           The Borrower may from time to time solicit Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers by providing the Administrative Agent with three Business Days  notice in the form of a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice;  provided  that (I) any such solicitation shall be extended, at the sole discretion of the Borrower, to each Lender or to each Lender with respect to any Tranche on an individual Tranche basis, (II) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans and the Tranches of Loans the Borrower is willing to prepay at a discount (the   Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount  ), (III) the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $10.0 million and whole increments of $1.0 million, and (IV) each such solicitation by the Borrower shall remain outstanding through the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date.  The Administrative Agent will promptly provide each relevant Lender with a copy of such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice and a form of the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 P.M., New York time on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the relevant Lenders (or such later date as may be designated by the Administrative Agent and approved by Borrower) (the   Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date  ).  Each Lender s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer shall (x) be irrevocable, (y) remain outstanding until the Acceptance Date, and (z) specify both a discount to par (the   Offered Discount  ) at which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of its then outstanding Loans and the maximum aggregate Outstanding Amount and Tranches of such Loans (the   Offered Amount  ) such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Offered Discount.  Any Lender whose Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer is not received by the Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined prepayment of any of its Loans at any discount to their par value.  
     
  (b)           The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Borrower with a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by it by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date.  The Borrower shall review all such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers and select, at its sole discretion, the smallest of the Offered Discounts specified by the relevant responding Lenders in the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers that the Borrower is willing to accept (the   Acceptable Discount  ), if any.  If the Borrower elects to accept any Offered Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then as soon as practicable after the determination of the Acceptable Discount, but in no event later than by the third Business Day after the date of receipt by the Borrower from the Administrative Agent of a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (b) (the   Acceptance Date  ), the Borrower shall submit an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice to the Administrative Agent setting forth the Acceptable Discount.  If the Administrative Agent shall fail to receive an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice from the Borrower by the Acceptance Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have rejected all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.  
     
  (c)           Based upon the Acceptable Discount and the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, within three Business Days after receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the   Discounted Prepayment Determination Date  ), the Administrative Agent will determine (in consultation  
     
 76   

with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranche(s) of Loans (the   Acceptable Prepayment Amount  ) to be prepaid by the Borrower at the Acceptable Discount in accordance with this subsection 3.4(i)(iv).  If the Borrower elects to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the Borrower agrees to accept all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by the Administrative Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, in the order from largest Offered Discount to smallest Offered Discount, up to and including the Acceptable Discount.  Each Lender that has submitted a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at an Offered Discount that is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Loans equal to its Offered Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following sentence) at the Acceptable Discount (each such Lender, a   Qualifying Lender  ).  The Borrower will prepay outstanding Loans pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i)(iv) to each Qualifying Lender in the aggregate Outstanding Amount and of the Tranches specified in such Lender s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable Discount;  provided  that if the aggregate Offered Amount by all Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount exceeds the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the Outstanding Amount of the Loans for those Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount (the   Identified Qualifying Lenders  ) shall be made  pro rata  among the Identified Qualifying Lenders in accordance with the Offered Amount of each such Identified Qualifying Lender and the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Administrative Agent made in its reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration (the   Solicited Discount Proration  ).  On or prior to the Discounted Prepayment Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify (w) the Borrower of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and Acceptable Prepayment Amount comprising the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the Tranches to be prepaid, (x) each Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Acceptable Discount, and the Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Loans and the Tranches to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (y) each Qualifying Lender of the aggregate Outstanding Amount and the Tranches of such Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date, and (z) if applicable, each Identified Qualifying Lender of the Solicited Discount Proration.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Borrower and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.  The payment amount specified in such notice to the Borrower shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with subsection 3.4(i)(vi) below (subject to subsection 3.4(i)(x) below).  
     
  (v)            Expenses .  In connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent may require as a condition to any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses from the Borrower in connection therewith.  
     
  (vi)           Payment .  If any Loan is prepaid in accordance with subsections 3.4(i)(ii) through (iv) above, the Borrower shall prepay such Loans on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date.  The Borrower shall make such prepayment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as applicable, at the Administrative Agent s office in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and all such prepayments shall be applied to the remaining principal installments of the Loans in inverse order of maturity.  The Loans so prepaid shall be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest on the  
     
 77   

par principal amount so prepaid up to, but not including, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date.  Each prepayment of the outstanding Loans pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) shall be paid to the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as applicable.  The aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Tranche(s) of the Loans outstanding shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Tranches of Loans prepaid on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date in any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment.  The Lenders hereby agree that, in connection with a prepayment of Loans pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) interest in respect of the Loans may be made on a non-pro rata basis among the Lenders holding such Loans to reflect the payment of accrued interest to certain Lenders as provided in this subsection 3.4(i)(vi) and (ii) all subsequent prepayments and repayments of the Loans (except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement) shall be made on a  pro rata  basis among the respective Lenders based upon the then outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by the respective Lenders after giving effect to any prepayment pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) as if made at par.  It is also understood and agreed that  prepayments pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) shall not be subject to subsection 3.4(a), or, for the avoidance of doubt, subsection 10.7(a) or the  pro rata  allocation requirements of subsection 3.8(a).  
     
  (vii)          Other Procedures .  To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each Discounted Term Loan Prepayment shall be consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions in this subsection 3.4(i), established by the Administrative Agent acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the Borrower.  
     
  (viii)         Notice .  Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, for purposes of this subsection 3.4(i), each notice or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Administrative Agent (or its delegate) shall be deemed to have been given upon the Administrative Agent s (or its delegate s) actual receipt during normal business hours of such notice or communication;  provided  that any notice or communication actually received outside of normal business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on the next Business Day.  
     
  (ix)           Actions of Administrative Agent .  Each of the Borrower and the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties under this subsection 3.4(i) by itself or through any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent and expressly consents to any such delegation of duties by the Administrative Agent to such Affiliate and the performance of such delegated duties by such Affiliate.  The exculpatory provisions in this Agreement shall apply to each Affiliate of the Administrative Agent and its respective activities in connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for in this subsection 3.4(i) as well as to activities of the Administrative Agent in connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for in this subsection 3.4(i).  
     
  (x)            Revocation .  The Borrower shall have the right, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, to revoke in full (but not in part) its offer to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and rescind the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Notice, Discount Range Prepayment Notice or Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice therefor at its discretion at any time on or prior to the applicable Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date (and if such offer is so revoked, any failure by the Borrower to make any prepayment to a Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default under subsection 8 or otherwise).  
     
 78   

(xi)           No Obligation .  This subsection 3.4(i) shall not (i) require the Borrower to undertake any prepayment pursuant to this subsection 3.4(i) or (ii) limit or restrict the Borrower from making voluntary prepayments of the Loans in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.  
     
   (j)             In the event of a Change of Control, the Borrower shall make an offer to the Lenders  (the   Change of Control Offer  ) in accordance with the procedures in this subsection 3.4(j) to prepay the Loans of each such Lender at a prepayment price in cash (a   Change of Control Payment  ) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below).  Within 30 days following obtaining knowledge of any Change of Control, the Borrower will notify the Administrative Agent, and promptly thereafter the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders,  that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this subsection 3.4(j).  Such notice shall specify (i) the Change of Control Payment and the date such prepayment will be made by or on behalf of the Borrower, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the   Change of Control Payment Date   (ii) that Lenders that have requested to have their Loan prepaid shall be entitled to withdraw such request;  provided  that the Borrower receives, not later than the close of business on the 30 th  day following the date of the Change of Control notice, notification in writing setting forth the name of the Lender, the principal amount of Loans that the Lender had requested to have prepaid, and a statement that such Lender is withdrawing its request to have such Loans prepaid and (iii) such other instructions, as reasonably determined by the Borrower, consistent with this subsection 3.4(j), that a Lender must follow.  On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans of each Lender that properly requested that its Loans be prepaid in an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of such Loans.  The Borrower will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Agreement applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Borrower and prepays all Loans properly requested to be prepaid (and with respect to which such request was not withdrawn) under the Change of Control Offer, (ii) notice of prepayment of all Loans hereunder has been given pursuant to this Agreement as described above unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable prepayment price, (iii) if, in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, it or a third party has made an offer to prepay (an   Alternate Offer  ) any and all Loans at a price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has so prepaid all Loans properly requested to be repaid (and with respect to which such request was not withdrawn) in accordance with the terms of such Alternate Offer or (iv) the Borrower has otherwise repaid all of the Loans in accordance with subsection 3.4(a) above (if permitted thereby).  A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. 
     
   3.5               Administrative Agent Fees;    Other Fees .  The Borrower agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent and the Other Representatives any fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by Holding Parent or the Borrower, the Other Representatives and the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement. 
     
   3.6               Computation of Interest and Fees .  
     
   (a)            Interest (other than interest based on the Prime Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed; and commitment fees and any other fees and interest based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-day year, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the affected Lenders of each determination of a Eurocurrency Rate.  Any change in the   
     
 79   

interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the affected Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.  
     
   (b)            Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender a statement showing in reasonable detail the calculations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to subsection 3.1, excluding any Eurocurrency Base Rate which is based upon the BBA LIBOR Rates Page and any ABR Loan which is based upon the Prime Rate.  
     
   3.7               Inability to Determine Interest Rate .  If prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan (the   Affected Rate  ) for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given (a) any Eurocurrency Loans the rate of interest applicable to which is based on the Affected Rate requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans and (b) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or continued as Eurocurrency Loans the rate of interest applicable to which is based upon the Affected Rate shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurocurrency Loans the rate of interest applicable to which is based upon the Affected Rate shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans the rate of interest applicable to which is based upon the Affected Rate.  
     
   3.8               Pro Rata Treatment and Payments .  
     
   (a)            Each payment (including each prepayment, but excluding payments made pursuant to subsections 2.6, 2.7, 3.4(j), 3.13, 10.1(f) or 10.6)) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on any Loans of a given Tranche (other than (x) any payments pursuant to subsection 3.4(b) or (c) to the extent declined by any Lender in accordance with subsection 3.4(e) and (y) any payments pursuant to subsection 3.4(i) which shall be allocated as set forth in subsection 3.4(i)) shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the respective Lenders (or as otherwise provided in the applicable Incremental Commitment Amendment or Extension Amendment).  All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders holding the relevant Loans at the Administrative Agent s office specified in subsection 10.2, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  Payments received by the Administrative Agent after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day, and otherwise the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such  
     
 80   

extension.  If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  This subsection 3.8 may be amended in accordance with subsection 10.1(e) to the extent necessary to reflect differing amounts payable and priorities of payments to Lenders under any new Tranches added pursuant to subsection 2.5 or 2.7, as applicable.  
     
   (b)            Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its Term Credit Percentage of such borrowing available to such Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower in respect of such borrowing a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate as quoted by the Administrative Agent, or another bank of recognized standing reasonably selected by the Administrative Agent, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection 3.8(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lender s Term Credit Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, (x) the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of the failure of such Lender to make such amount available to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate  per annum  applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower and (y) then the Borrower may, without waiving or limiting any rights or remedies it may have against such Lender hereunder or under applicable law or otherwise, borrow a like amount on an unsecured basis from any commercial bank for a period ending on the date upon which such Lender does in fact make such borrowing available.  
     
   3.9               Illegality .  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement (  Affected Loans  ), (a) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Affected Loans, continue Affected Loans as such and convert an ABR Loan to an Affected Loan shall forthwith be cancelled and, until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain such Affected Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make an ABR Loan when an Affected Loan is requested and (c) such Lender s Loans then outstanding as Affected Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law.  If any such conversion of an Affected Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection 3.12.  
     
 81   

3.10            Requirements of Law .  
     
   (a)            If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable to any Lender, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date (or, if later, the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender):  
     
   (i)             shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan made or maintained by it or its obligation to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof in each case, except for Non-Excluded Taxes, Taxes imposed under FATCA and taxes measured by or imposed upon the overall net income, or franchise taxes, or taxes measured by or imposed upon overall capital or net worth, or branch taxes (in the case of such capital, net worth or branch taxes, imposed in lieu of such net income tax), of such Lender or its applicable lending office, branch, or any affiliate thereof;  
     
   (ii)            shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate hereunder; or  
     
   (iii)           shall impose on such Lender any other condition (excluding any tax of any kind whatsoever);  
     
  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, upon notice to the Borrower from such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, in accordance herewith, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable with respect to such Eurocurrency Loans,  provided  that, in any such case, the Borrower may elect to convert the Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender hereunder to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day s notice of such election, in which case the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon demand, without duplication, amounts theretofore required to be paid to such Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.10(a) and such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection 3.12.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, certifying (x) that one of the events described in this paragraph (a) has occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount demanded by such Lender and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof.  Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This subsection 3.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

 82   

capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority, in each case, made subsequent to the Closing Date, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of such Lender s obligations or hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within ten Business Days after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor certifying (x) that one of the events described in this paragraph (b) has occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the reduction of the rate of return on capital resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount or amounts demanded by such Lender or corporation and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or corporation for such reduction.  Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

 83   

time, a   Change in Law  ) or (2) on a Person that is an assignee whose assignor was entitled to receive additional amounts with respect to payments made by the Borrower, at the time such assignment was effective, as a result of Change in Law that occurred after the Closing Date and such assignee is subject to the same Change in Law with respect to payments from the Borrower,  provided  that in no event shall such additional amounts under this clause (2) exceed the additional amounts that the assignor was entitled to receive at the time such assignment was effective, or (z) with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes imposed by the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof, unless such Non-Excluded Taxes are imposed (1) as a result of a Change in Law or (2) on a Person that is an assignee whose assignor was entitled to receive additional amounts with respect to payments made by the Borrower, at the time such assignment was effective, as a result of Change in Law that occurred after the Closing Date and such assignee is subject to the same Change in Law with respect to payments from the Borrower,  provided  that in no event shall such additional amounts under this clause (2) exceed the additional amounts that the assignor was entitled to receive at the time such assignment was effective.

If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Agents for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

In addition, each Agent and Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when the passage of time or a change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate, such Agent or Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (claiming the benefits of the portfolio interest exemption) and a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, or Form W-8IMY (with respect to a non-U.S. intermediary or flow-through entity), as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Agent or Lender to a continued exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note (or, to the extent the beneficial owners of such non-U.S. intermediary or flow through entity are (A) non-U.S. persons claiming portfolio interest treatment, a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to interest payments or (B) United States persons, a complete exemption from United States federal backup withholding tax), unless, in each case, (1) there has been a Change in Law that occurs after the date such Agent or Lender becomes an Agent or Lender hereunder (or after the date the relevant beneficiary or member in the case of a Lender that is a non-U.S. intermediary or flow through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes becomes a beneficiary or member, if later) which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Agent or Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it, in which case such Agent or Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such form or (2) such Person is an assignee whose assignor was entitled to receive additional amounts with respect to payments made by the Borrower, at the time such assignment was effective, as a result of a Change in Law that occurred after the Closing Date and such assignee is subject to the same Change in Law with respect to payments from the Borrower,  provided  that in no event shall such additional amounts under this clause (2) exceed the additional amounts that the assignor was entitled to receive at the time such assignment was effective.  
     
   (c)            Each Agent and Lender shall, upon request by the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower or the applicable Governmental Authority, as the case may be, any form or certificate required in order that any payment by the Borrower under this Agreement or any Note to such Agent or Lender may be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes (including any United States withholding taxes under FATCA) (or to allow any such deduction or withholding to be at a reduced rate),  provided  that such Agent or Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such form or certificate.  Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant pursuant to subsection 10.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements pursuant to this subsection 3.11,  provided  that in the case of a Participant the obligations of such Participant pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection 3.11 shall be determined as

   3.12            Indemnity .  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each such Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur (other than through such Lender s gross negligence or willful misconduct) as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment or conversion of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a payment or prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans or the conversion of Eurocurrency Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.  Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or converted, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or conversion or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurocurrency Loans, as applicable, provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurocurrency market.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any amounts under the indemnity contained in this subsection 3.12, it shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, certifying (x) that one of the events described in clause (a), (b) or (c) has occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the loss or expense sustained or incurred by such Lender as a consequence thereof and (z) as to the amount for which such Lender seeks indemnification hereunder and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof.  Such a certificate as to any indemnification pursuant to this subsection 3.12 submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This subsection 3.12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
     
   3.13            Certain Rules Relating to the Payment of Additional Amounts .  
     
   (a)            Upon the request, and at the expense, of the Borrower, each Agent and Lender to which the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to subsection 3.10 or 3.11, and any Participant in respect of whose participation such payment is required, shall reasonably afford the Borrower the opportunity to contest, and reasonably cooperate with the Borrower in contesting, the imposition of any Non-Excluded Tax giving rise to such payment;  provided  that (i) such Agent or Lender shall not be required to afford the Borrower the opportunity to so contest unless the Borrower shall have confirmed in writing to such Agent or Lender its obligation to pay such amounts pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the Borrower shall reimburse such Agent or Lender for its reasonable attorneys  and accountants  fees and disbursements incurred in so cooperating with the Borrower in contesting the imposition of such Non-Excluded Tax;  provided ,  however , that notwithstanding the foregoing no Agent. Lender shall be required to afford the Borrower the opportunity to contest, or cooperate with the Borrower in contesting, the imposition of any Non-Excluded Taxes, if such Agent or Lender in its sole discretion in good faith determines that to do so would have an adverse effect on it.  
     
   (b)            If a Lender changes its applicable lending office (other than (i) pursuant to paragraph (c) below or (ii) after an Event of Default under subsection 8(a) or (f) has occurred and is continuing) and the effect of such change, as of the date of such change, would be to cause the Borrower to become   
     
 86   

obligated to pay any additional amount under subsection 3.10 or 3.11, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such additional amount.  
     
   (c)            If a condition or an event occurs which would, or would upon the passage of time or giving of notice, result in the payment of any additional amount to any Lender by the Borrower pursuant to subsection 3.10 or 3.11, such Lender shall promptly after becoming aware of such event or condition notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and shall take such steps as may reasonably be available to it to mitigate the effects of such condition or event (which shall include efforts to rebook the Loans, as the case may be, held by such Lender at another lending office, or through another branch or an affiliate, of such Lender);  provided  that such Lender shall not be required to take any step that, in its reasonable judgment, would be materially disadvantageous to its business or operations or would require it to incur additional costs (unless the Borrower agrees to reimburse such Lender for the reasonable incremental out-of-pocket costs thereof).  
     
   (d)            If the Borrower shall become obligated to pay additional amounts pursuant to subsection 3.10 or 3.11 and any affected Lender shall not have promptly taken steps necessary to avoid the need for payments under subsection 3.10 or 3.11, the Borrower shall have the right, for so long as such obligation remains, (i) with the assistance of the Administrative Agent, to seek one or more substitute Lenders reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to purchase the affected Loan, in whole or in part, at an aggregate price no less than such Loan s principal amount  plus  accrued interest, and assume the affected obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists or will exist immediately after giving effect to the respective prepayment, upon at least four Business Days  irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, to prepay the affected Loan, in whole or in part, subject to subsection 3.12, without premium or penalty.  In the case of the substitution of a Lender, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the affected Lender, and any substitute Lender shall execute and deliver an appropriately completed Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to subsection 10.6(b) to effect the assignment of rights to, and the assumption of obligations by, the substitute Lender;  provided  that any fees required to be paid by subsection 10.6(b) in connection with such assignment shall be paid by the Borrower or the substitute Lender.  In the case of a prepayment of an affected Loan, the amount specified in the notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with any accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid.  In the case of each of the substitution of a Lender and of the prepayment of an affected Loan, the Borrower shall first pay the affected Lender any additional amounts owing under subsections 3.10 and 3.11 (as well as any commitment fees and other amounts then due and owing to such Lender, including any amounts under subsection 3.13) prior to such substitution or prepayment.  
     
   (e)            If any Agent or Lender receives a refund directly attributable to taxes for which the Borrower has made additional payments pursuant to subsection 3.10(a) or 3.11(a), such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly pay such refund (together with any interest with respect thereto received from the relevant taxing authority, but net of any reasonable cost incurred in connection therewith) to the Borrower;  provided ,  however , that the Borrower agrees promptly to return such refund (together with any interest with respect thereto due to the relevant taxing authority) (free of all Non-Excluded Taxes) to such Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, upon receipt of a notice that such refund is required to be repaid to the relevant taxing authority.  
     
   (f)             The obligations of any Agent, Lender or Participant under this subsection 3.13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
     
 87

  (a)                                    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby except that (i) other than in accordance with subsection 7.3, the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this subsection 10.6. 
     
  (b)                                    (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may, in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable law, assign (other than to a Disqualified Lender or any natural person) to one or more assignees (each, an   Assignee  ) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including its Commitments and/or Loans, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: 
     
  (A)                                  The Borrower,  provided  that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default under subsection 8(a) or (f) has occurred and is continuing, any other Person;  provided ,  further , that if any Lender assigns all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one of its affiliates in connection with or in contemplation of the sale or other disposition of its interest in such affiliate, the Borrower s prior written consent shall be required for such assignment; and 
     
  (B)                                  the Administrative Agent;  provided  that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below). 
     
  (ii)                                     Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
     
  (A)                                  except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitments or Loans, as the case may be, the amount of Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1.0 million unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;  provided  that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under  
     
 140   

subsection 8(a) or (f) has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any;  
     
  (B)                                  the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee, if applicable,  of $3,500.00 (unless waived by the Administrative Agent in any given case);  provided  that for concurrent assignments to two or more Approved Funds such assignment fee shall only be required to be paid once in respect of and at the time of such assignments; and 
     
  (C)                                  the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire. 
     
  For the purposes of this subsection 10.6, the term   Approved Fund   has the following meaning:  any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be permitted to make assignments under this Agreement to any Disqualified Lender or any natural person.  
     
  (iii)                                  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of (and bound by any related obligations under) subsections 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and 10.5).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection. 
     
  (iv)                                 The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent agrees, to serve as the Borrower s agent, solely for purposes of this subsection 10.6, to maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and interest and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   Register  ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and any Lender (with respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Person is a Disqualified Lender or an Affiliated Lender nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the aggregate amount of Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders. 
     
  (v)                                    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee s completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph 
     
 141   

(b) of this subsection and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance, record the information contained therein in the Register and give prompt notice of such assignment and recordation to the Borrower.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.  
     
  (vi)                                 On or prior to the effective date of any assignment pursuant to this subsection 10.6(b), the assigning Lender shall surrender any outstanding Notes held by it all or a portion of which are being assigned.  Any Notes surrendered by the assigning Lender shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked  cancelled.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 10.6(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, if the Borrower shall have consented thereto in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to effectuate assignments of Loans and Commitments via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as designated in writing from time to time to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent (the   Settlement Service  ).  At any time when the Administrative Agent elects, in its sole discretion, to implement such Settlement Service, each such assignment shall be effected by the assigning Lender and proposed Assignee pursuant to the procedures then in effect under the Settlement Service, which procedures shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower and shall be consistent with the other provisions of this subsection 10.6(b).  Each assigning Lender and proposed Assignee shall comply with the requirements of the Settlement Service in connection with effecting any assignment of Loans and Commitments pursuant to the Settlement Service.  If so elected by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing (it being understood that the Borrower shall have no obligation to make such an election), the Administrative Agent s and the Borrower s approval of such Assignee shall be deemed to have been automatically granted with respect to any transfer effected through the Settlement Service.  Assignments and assumptions of the Loans and Commitments shall be effected by the provisions otherwise set forth herein until Administrative Agent notifies Lenders of the Settlement Service as set forth herein.  The Borrower may withdraw its consent to the use of the Settlement Service at any time upon at least 10 Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, and thereafter assignments and assumptions of the Loans and Commitments shall be effected by the provisions otherwise set forth herein.  
     
  Furthermore, no Assignee, which as of the date of any assignment to it pursuant to this subsection 10.6(b) would be entitled to receive any greater payment under subsection 3.10, 3.11 or 10.5 than the assigning Lender would have been entitled to receive as of such date under such subsections with respect to the rights assigned, shall be entitled to receive such greater payments unless the assignment was made after an Event of Default under subsection 8(a) or (f) has occurred and is continuing or the Borrower has expressly consented in writing to waive the benefit of this provision at the time of such assignment.  
     
  (c)                                     (i)  Any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations (other than to Disqualified Lenders and natural persons (it being understood that upon reasonable request to the Administrative Agent, a list of such Disqualified Lenders (with respect to financial institutions pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition thereof) shall be made available to any Lender)) to one or more banks or other entities (a   Participant  ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);  provided that  (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the 
     
 142   

other Loan Documents, and (D) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided  that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of subsection 10.1(a) and (2) directly and adversely affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this subsection, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of (and shall have the related obligations under) subsections 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and 10.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender,  provided  that such Participant shall be subject to subsection 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be permitted to sell participations under this Agreement to any Disqualified Lender.  
     
  (ii)                                     No Loan Party shall be obligated to make any greater payment under subsection 3.10, 3.11 or 10.5 than it would have been obligated to make in the absence of any participation, unless the sale of such participation is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Borrower expressly waives the benefit of this provision at the time of such participation.  No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 3.11 to the extent such Participant fails to comply with subsection 3.11(b) and/or (c) or to provide the forms and certificates referenced therein to the Lender that granted such participation and such failure increases the obligation of the Borrower under subsection 3.11. 
     
  (iii)                                  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii), any Lender other than a Conduit Lender may also sell participations on terms other than the terms set forth in paragraph (c)(i) above,  provided  such participations are on terms and to Participants satisfactory to the Borrower and the Borrower has consented to such terms and Participants in writing. 
     
  (iv)                                 Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting for itself and, solely for this purpose, as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the interest and principal amounts of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   Participant Register    provided  that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in its Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
     
  (d)                                    Any Lender, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this subsection shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;  provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute (by foreclosure or otherwise) any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
     
 143   

(e)                                     No assignment or participation made or purported to be made to any Assignee or Participant shall be effective without the prior written consent of the Borrower if it would require the Borrower to make any filing with any Governmental Authority or qualify any Loan or Note under the laws of any jurisdiction, and the Borrower shall be entitled to request and receive such information and assurances as it may reasonably request from any Lender or any Assignee or Participant to determine whether any such filing or qualification is required or whether any assignment or participation is otherwise in accordance with applicable law. 
     
  (f)                                      Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in subsection 10.6(b).  The Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any domestic or foreign bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state, federal or provincial bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender;  provided ,  however , that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.  Each such indemnifying Lender shall pay in full any claim received from the Borrower pursuant to this subsection 10.6(f) within 30 Business Days of receipt of a certificate from a Responsible Officer of the Borrower specifying in reasonable detail the cause and amount of the loss, cost, damage or expense in respect of which the claim is being asserted, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Without limiting the indemnification obligations of any indemnifying Lender pursuant to this subsection 10.6(f), in the event that the indemnifying Lender fails timely to compensate the Borrower for such claim, any Loans held by the relevant Conduit Lender shall, if requested by the Borrower, be assigned promptly to the Lender that administers the Conduit Lender and the designation of such Conduit Lender shall be void. 
     
  (g)                                     If the Borrower wishes to replace the Loans under any Tranche with ones having different terms, it shall have the option, with the consent of the Administrative Agent and subject to at least three Business Days  advance notice to the Lenders instead of prepaying the Loans of such Tranche to be replaced, to (i) require the Lenders to assign such Loans to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) amend the terms thereof in accordance with subsection 10.1 (with such replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to subsection 10.1(f)).  Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated among the Lenders under such Tranche in the same manner as would be required if such Loans were being optionally prepaid by the Borrower), accompanied by payment of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to subsections 3.4 or 3.12.  By receiving such purchase price, the Lenders under such Tranche, as applicable, shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans under such Tranche pursuant to the terms of the form of Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as  Exhibit B , and accordingly no other action by such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith.  The provisions of this paragraph are intended to facilitate the maintenance of the perfection and priority of existing security interests in the Collateral during any such replacement.
