1.                                            Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  Mistras Group, Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") is a leading  one source  global provider of technology-enabled asset protection solutions used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy, industrial and public infrastructure. The Company combines industry-leading products and technologies, expertise in mechanical integrity (MI) and non-destructive testing (NDT) services and proprietary data analysis software to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of customized solutions, ranging from routine inspections to complex, plant-wide asset integrity assessments and management. These mission critical solutions enhance customers  ability to extend the useful life of their assets, increase productivity, minimize repair costs, comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations, manage risk and avoid catastrophic disasters. The Company serves a global customer base of companies with asset-intensive infrastructure, including companies in the oil and gas, fossil and nuclear power, alternative and renewable energy, public infrastructure, chemicals, commercial aerospace and defense, transportation, primary metals and metalworking, pharmaceutical/biotechnology and food processing industries and research and engineering institutions. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods of the fiscal years ending   May 31, 2017   and   2016  . Reference to a fiscal year means the fiscal year ended   May 31  . Certain items included in these statements are based on management s estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2016 Annual Report ) for fiscal   2016  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   August 15, 2016  . 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mistras Group, Inc. and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. For subsidiaries in which the Company s ownership interest is less than 100%, the noncontrolling interests are reported in stockholders  equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling interests in net income, net of tax, is classified separately in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. 
    
  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Mistras Group, Inc. s and its subsidiaries  fiscal years end on May 31 except for the subsidiaries in the International segment, which end on April 30. Accordingly, the Company s International segment subsidiaries are consolidated on a   one month   lag. Therefore, in the quarter and year of acquisition, results of acquired subsidiaries in the International segment are generally included in consolidated results for   one   less month than the actual number of months from the acquisition date to the end of the reporting period. Management does not believe that any events occurred during the one-month lag period that would have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Reclassification 
    
  Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Such reclassifications did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations as previously reported. 
    
  Customers 
    
  One   customer accounted for approximately   14%   of our revenues and   13%   of accounts receivable in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which primarily were generated from the Services segment.     No   customer accounted for   10%   or more of our revenues or accounts receivable in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in the Company's 2016 Annual Report. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including, among other things those related to revenue recognition, valuations of accounts receivable, long-lived assets, goodwill, deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Since the date of the 2016 Annual Report, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, as a result of a one year deferral in the standard issued by the FASB in August 2015 with ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date.   Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.    This amendment will simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments in previous reporting periods.  This update will require on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have previously been recorded if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter ended August 31, 2016.   There was not a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740):  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.    This amendment will simplify the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and require all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be treated as non-current.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect that   ASU 2015-17 will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).    This amendment supersedes previous accounting guidance (  Topic 840)   and requires all leases, with exception of leases with a term of 12 months or less, to be recorded on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities.   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The standard requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issues ASU No. 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).    This amendment will simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, which include accounting for income taxes and the related impact on the statement of cash flows, an option to account for forfeitures when they occur in addition to the existing guidance to  estimate the forfeitures of awards, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows for employee taxes paid to tax authorities on shares withheld for vesting.   ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.   The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).    This amendment will provide guidance on the presentation and classification of specific cash flow items to improve consistency within the statement of cash flows.   ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.   The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

2.                                            Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has share-based incentive awards outstanding to its eligible employees and Directors under   two   equity incentive plans: (i) the 2007 Stock Option Plan (the 2007 Plan), and (ii) the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan).   No   further awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan, although awards granted under the 2007 Plan remain outstanding in accordance

with their terms. Awards granted under the 2009 Plan may be in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and other forms of share-based incentives, including performance restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock rights. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  For the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , the Company did not recognize any share-based compensation expense related to stock option awards.   No   unrecognized compensation costs remained related to stock option awards as of   August 31, 2016  . 
    
  For the   three months ended August 31, 2015  , the Company recognized share-based compensation expense related to stock option awards of less than   $0.1 million  .    
    
  No   stock options were granted during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  . 
    
  A summary of the stock option activity, weighted average exercise prices and options outstanding as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
    
  For both the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , the Company recognized share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards of   $1.1 million  . As of   August 31, 2016  , there was   $11.2 million   of unrecognized compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock unit awards, which are expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of   2.9 years  . 
    
  During the first   three   months of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , the Company granted approximately   10,000   and   15,000   shares, respectively, of fully-vested common stock to its   five   non-employee directors, in connection with its non-employee director compensation plan. These shares had grant date fair values of   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, which was recorded as share-based compensation expense during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  During the first   three   months of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , approximately   175,000   and   205,000   restricted stock units, respectively, vested. The fair value of these units was   $4.4 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively. Upon vesting, restricted stock units are generally net share-settled to cover the required minimum withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. 
    
  A summary of the Company's outstanding, nonvested restricted share units is presented below:

  (tabular dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 

Performance Restricted Stock Units 
    
  The Company maintains Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) that have been granted to select executives and senior officers whose ultimate payout is based on the Company s performance over a   one  -year period based on   three   metrics, as defined: (1) Operating Income, (2) Adjusted EBITDAS individual performance and (3) Revenue.   There is a discretionary portion of the PRSUs based on individual performance, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (Discretionary PRSUs). PRSUs and Discretionary PRSUs generally vest ratably on each of the first four anniversary dates upon completion of the performance period, for a total requisite service period of   five   years and have no dividend rights. 
    
  PRSUs are equity-classified and compensation costs are initially measured using the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant, assuming that the target performance conditions will be achieved. Compensation costs related to the PRSUs are subsequently adjusted for changes in the expected outcomes of the performance conditions. 
    
  Discretionary PRSUs are liability-classified and adjusted to fair value (with a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense) based upon the targeted number of shares to be awarded and the fair value of the underlying stock each reporting period until approved by the Compensation Committee, at which point they are classified as equity. 
    
  A summary of the Company's Performance Restricted Stock Unit activity is presented below:

     Table of Contents  
    
  Mistras Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (tabular dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 

During the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , the Compensation Committee approved an additional   19,000   units pertaining to the 2016 Discretionary PRSUs. There was   no   adjustment to the fiscal 2017 awards during the   three months ended August 31, 2016  . 
    
  As of August 31, 2016, the aggregate liability related to   21,000   outstanding Discretionary PRSUs was less than   $0.1 million  , and is classified within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  For the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , the Company recognized aggregate share-based compensation expense related to the awards described above of approximately   $0.5 million   and $  0.6 million  , respectively. At   August 31, 2016  , there was   $5.7 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to   452,000   non-vested performance restricted stock units, which are expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of   4.2 years  . 

3.                                            Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the sum of (1) the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, and (2) the dilutive effect of assumed conversion of equity awards using the treasury stock method. With respect to the number of weighted-average shares outstanding (denominator), diluted shares reflects: (i) the exercise of options to acquire common stock to the extent that the options  exercise prices are less than the average market price of common shares during the period and (ii) the pro forma vesting of restricted stock units. 
    
  The following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share:

4.                                            Acquisitions  
    
  In the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Company completed   two   acquisitions.  The Company purchased   two   companies  located in Canada that provide NDT services.   
    
  In these acquisitions, the Company acquired   100%   of the common stock of both acquirees in exchange for aggregate consideration of   $1.2 million   in cash,   $0.3 million   of notes payable and contingent consideration estimated to be   $0.4 million   to be earned based upon the acquired businesses achieving specific performance metrics over their initial   three   years of operations from their acquisition dates.  The Company accounted for these transactions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.  
    
  The assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired in fiscal 2017 were included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet based upon their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition as determined in a preliminary purchase price allocation, using available information and making assumptions management believes are reasonable.  The Company is still in the process of completing its valuation of the assets, both tangible and intangible, and liabilities acquired.  The results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the Services segment's results from the date of acquisition. The Company's preliminary purchase price allocations are included in the table below, summarizing the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:  

Revenues and operating income included in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 from these acquisitions for the period subsequent to the closing of these transactions were approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.   As these acquisitions are not significant to the Company's 2017 results, no unaudited pro forma financial information has been included in this report.  
    
  The Company did not complete any acquisitions in the first three months of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Acquisition-Related Expense    
    
  During the   three   month periods ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of less than   $0.1 million  , respectively, in connection with due diligence, professional fees, and other expenses for its acquisition activities.  Additionally, the Company adjusted the fair value of certain previously recorded acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. These adjustments resulted in a net (increase) decrease of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities and  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Mistras Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (tabular dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)

  Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Senior Credit Facility 
    
  On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Third Amendment and Modification Agreement of its revolving line of credit, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Credit Agreement ), dated December 21, 2011, with its lending group. The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a   $175.0 million   revolving line of credit, which, under certain circumstances, the line of credit can be increased to   $225.0 million  . The Company may borrow up to   $30.0 million   in non-U.S. Dollar currencies and use up to   $10.0 million   of the credit limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of October 30, 2019. As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company had borrowings of   $64.8 million   and a total of   $5.2 million   of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at   LIBOR   plus an applicable LIBOR margin ranging from   1%   to   1.75%  , or a   base rate   less a margin of   1.25%   to   0.375%  , at the option of the Company, based upon the Company s Funded Debt Leverage Ratio. Funded Debt Leverage Ratio is generally the ratio of (1) all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other interest-bearing indebtedness as of the date of determination to (2) EBITDA (which is (a) net income, less (b) income (or plus loss) from discontinued operations and extraordinary items, plus (c) income tax expenses, plus (d) interest expense, plus (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization (including non-cash loss on retirement of assets), plus (f) stock compensation expense, less (g) cash expense related to stock compensation, plus or minus certain other adjustments) for the period of   four   consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the date of determination. The Company has the benefit of the lowest margin if its Funded Debt Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than   0.5   to 1, and the margin increases as the ratio increases, to the maximum margin if the ratio is greater than   2.0   to 1. The Company will also bear additional costs for market disruption, regulatory changes effecting the lenders  funding costs, and default pricing of an additional   2%   interest rate margin on any amounts not paid when due. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring that the Company maintain a Funded Debt Leverage Ratio of no greater than   3.25   to 1 and an Interest Coverage Ratio of at least   3.0   to 1. Interest Coverage Ratio means the ratio, as of any date of determination, of (a) EBITDA for the   12   month period immediately preceding the date of determination, to (b) all interest, premium payments, debt discount, fees, charges and related expenses of the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with borrowed money (including capitalized interest) or in connection with the deferred purchase price of assets, in each case to the extent treated as interest in accordance with GAAP, paid during the 12 month period immediately preceding the date of determination. The Credit Agreement also limits the Company s ability to, among other things, create liens, make investments, incur more indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make dispositions of property, pay dividends and make distributions to stockholders, enter into a new line of business, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into burdensome agreements. The Credit Agreement does not limit the Company s ability to acquire other businesses or companies except that the acquired business or company must be in the Company's line of business, the Company must be in compliance with the financial covenants on a pro forma basis after taking into account the acquisition, and, if the acquired business is a separate subsidiary, in certain circumstances the lenders will receive the benefit of a guaranty of the subsidiary and liens on its assets and a pledge of its stock. 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and will continuously monitor its compliance with the covenants contained in its credit agreement.

Notes Payable and Other 
    
  In connection with certain of its acquisitions, the Company issued subordinated notes payable to the sellers. The maturity of the notes that remain outstanding are   three   years from the date of acquisition and bear interest at the prime rate for Bank of Canada, currently   2.7%    as of August 31, 2016.  Interest expense is recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The Company has evaluated current market conditions and borrower credit quality and has determined that the carrying value of its long-term debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the Company s notes payable and capital lease obligations approximates their carrying amounts based on anticipated interest rates which management believes would currently be available to the Company for similar issuances of debt. 

11.                                     Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Company performs fair value measurements in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It also establishes a three level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions about inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available. 
    
  In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of the Company s financial liabilities that are required to be remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities that was classified as Level 3 in the table above was estimated using a discounted cash flow technique with significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in ASC 820. The significant inputs in the Level 3 measurement not supported by market activity include the probability assessments of expected future cash flows related to the acquisitions, appropriately discounted considering the uncertainties associated with the obligation, and as calculated in accordance with the terms of the applicable acquisition agreements.

Legal Proceedings and Government Investigations 
    
  The Company is subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against it.  Except for the matters described below, the Company does not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding to which the Company is a party will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  The costs of defense and amounts that may be recovered against the Company may be covered by insurance for certain matters. 
    
  Litigation and Commercial Claims  
    
  The Company is currently a defendant in a consolidated purported class and collective action,   Edgar Viceral and David Kruger v Mistras Group, et al  , pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  This matter results from the consolidation of two cases originally filed in California state court in April 2015.  The consolidated case alleges violations of California statutes, primarily the California Labor Code, and seeks to proceed as a collective action under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act.  The case is predicated on claims for allegedly missed rest and meal periods, inaccurate wage statements, and failure to pay all wages due, as well as related unfair business practices, and is requesting payment of all damages, including unpaid wages, and various fines and penalties available under California and Federal law.  
    
  The parties have reached a settlement of the case, whereby the Company agreed to pay   $6 million   to resolve the allegations and avoid further distraction that would result if the litigation continued.  The settlement is subject to court approval, and a hearing for preliminary approval was held on August 18, 2016, but a ruling has not yet been issued.  The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of   $6.3 million   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 for the settlement and payment of payroll taxes and other costs related to the settlement.  The settlement will cover claims dating back to April 2011 in some cases and involves approximately   4,900   current and former employees. 
    
  During fiscal 2013, the Company performed radiography work on the construction of a pipeline project in the U.S. The owner of the pipeline project contends that certain of the radiography images the Company s technicians prepared regarding the project did not meet the code quality interpretation standards required by the American Petroleum Institute.  The project owner is claiming damages as a result of the alleged quality defects of the Company s radiography images.   No   lawsuit has been filed at this time, but the Company received a demand for damages of approximately   $6 million  .  The Company is currently unable to determine the likely outcome or reasonably estimate the amount or range of potential liability related to this matter, and accordingly, has not established any reserves for this matter. 
    
  The Company s subsidiary in France has been involved in a dispute with a former owner of a business in France purchased by the Company s French subsidiary.  The former owner received a judgment in his favor in the amount of approximately   $0.4 million   for payment of the contingent consideration portion of the purchase price for the business.  The judgment is being appealed, but the Company recorded a reserve for the full amount of the judgment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Government Investigations 
    
  In May 2015, the Company received a notice from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) that it performed a preliminary assessment at a leased facility the Company operates in Cudahy, California. Based upon the preliminary assessment, the EPA is conducting an investigation of the site, which includes taking groundwater and soil samples. The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether any hazardous materials were released from the facility. The Company has been informed that certain hazardous materials and pollutants have been found in the ground water in the general vicinity of the site and the EPA is attempting to ascertain the origination or source of these materials and pollutants. Given the historic industrial use of the site, the EPA determined that the site of the Cudahy facility should be examined, along with numerous other sites in the vicinity. At this time, the Company is unable to determine whether it has any liability in connection with this matter and if so, the amount or range of any such liability, and accordingly, has not established any reserves for this matter.

Acquisition-related contingencies 
    
  The Company is liable for contingent consideration in connection with certain of its acquisitions. As of   August 31, 2016  , total potential acquisition-related contingent consideration ranged from   zero   to approximately   $15.4 million   and would be payable upon the achievement of specific performance metrics by certain of the acquired companies over the next   2.8 years   of operations. See Note 4 -   Acquisitions   to these condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company s acquisitions.

Overview 
    
  We offer our customers  one source for asset protection solutions   and are a leading global provider of technology-enabled asset protection solutions used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy, industrial and public infrastructure. We combine industry-leading products and technologies, expertise in mechanical integrity (MI), Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), Destructive Testing (DT) and predictive maintenance (PdM) services, process and fixed asset engineering and consulting services, proprietary data analysis and our world class enterprise inspection database management and analysis software, PCMS, to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of customized solutions, ranging from routine inspections to complex, plant-wide asset integrity management and assessments. These mission critical solutions enhance our customers  ability to comply with governmental safety and environmental regulations, extend the useful life of their assets, increase productivity, minimize repair costs, manage risk and avoid catastrophic disasters. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Services, International and Products and Systems. 

20 

     Table of Contents  

Services   provides asset protection solutions predominantly in North America with the largest concentration in the United States along with a growing Canadian business, consisting primarily of NDT, inspection and engineering services that are used to evaluate the structural integrity and reliability of critical energy, industrial and public infrastructure. 

International   offers services, products and systems similar to those of the other segments to global markets, principally in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America, but not to customers in China and South Korea, which are served by the Products and Systems segment. South America consists of our Brazil operations. 

Products and Systems   designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services the Company s asset protection products and systems, including equipment and instrumentation, predominantly in the United States. 
       
  Given the role our solutions play in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of infrastructure, we provide a majority of our services to our customers on a regular, recurring basis. We serve a global customer base of companies with asset-intensive infrastructure, including companies in the oil and gas (downstream, midstream, upstream and petrochemical), power generation (natural gas, fossil, nuclear, alternative, renewable, and transmission and distribution), public infrastructure, chemicals, commercial aerospace and defense, transportation, primary metals and metalworking, pharmaceutical/biotechnology and food processing industries and research and engineering institutions. We have established long-term relationships as a critical solutions provider to many of the leading companies in our target markets. 
    
  We have focused on introducing our advanced asset protection solutions to our customers using proprietary, technology-enabled software and testing instruments, including those developed by our Products and Systems segment. We have made a number of acquisitions in an effort to grow our base of experienced, certified personnel, expand our product and technical capabilities, increase our geographical reach and leverage our fixed costs. We have increased our capabilities and the size of our customer base through the development of applied technologies and managed support services, organic growth and the integration of acquired companies. These acquisitions have provided us with additional products, technologies, resources and customers that we believe will enhance our advantages over our competition. 
    
  Demand for outsourced asset protection solutions has generally increased over the last ten years, creating demand from which our entire industry has benefited. We believe continued growth can be realized in all of our target markets. However, current market conditions are soft, driven by lower oil prices which have driven many of the Company s customers to curtail spending.  
    
  Global financial markets continue to experience uncertainty, including tight liquidity and credit availability, relatively low consumer confidence, slow economic growth, fluctuating oil prices and volatile currency exchange rates. However, we believe these conditions have allowed us to selectively hire new talented individuals that otherwise might not have been available to us, and to make acquisitions of complementary businesses at reasonable valuations. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Condensed consolidated results of operations for the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   were as follows: 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, to measure its consolidated operating performance and assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided below for the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  : 

Note About Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure used by management that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is defined in this Report as net income attributable to Mistras Group, Inc. plus: interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, and certain acquisition-related costs (including transaction due diligence costs and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration), foreign exchange (gain) loss and, if applicable, certain special items which are noted. 
    
  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations. Adjusted EBITDA is also used as the basis for a performance evaluation metric for certain of our executive and employee incentive compensation programs. 
    
  Later in this MD A under the heading "Income from Operations", the non-GAAP financial performance measure "Income from operations before special items  is used for each of our three segments and the "Total Company", with tables reconciling the measure to a financial measure under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure excludes from the GAAP measure "Income from Operations" (a) transaction expenses related to acquisitions, such as professional fees and due diligence costs, (b) the net  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities and (c) certain non-recurring items. These items have been excluded from the GAAP measure because these expenses and credits are not related to the Company s or Segment s core business operations. The acquisition related costs and special items can be a net expense or credit in any given period. 
    
  In the MD A section "Liquidity and Capital Resources", we use the term free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which are purchases of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets and classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow, which does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since items such as debt repayments are not deducted in determing such measures, was   $13.3 million   for the first   three   months of fiscal 2017, consisting of   $17.3 million   of operating cash flow less   $4.0 million   of capital expenditures. For the comparable period in fiscal 2016, free cash flow was   $11.6 million   consisting of   $16.2 million   of operating cash flow less   $4.6 million   of capital expenditures. 
    
  Revenue 
    
  Revenues for the   three months ended August 31, 2016   were   $168.4 million  , a   decrease   of   $11.4 million  , or   6.3%  , compared with the prior year.  
    
  Revenues by segment for the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Three Months 
    
  In the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017  , Services segment revenues   decreased     8%   due to a combination of high single digit organic decline and low single digit adverse impact of foreign exchange rates, offset by a small amount of acquisition growth.  Products and Systems segment revenues   decreased   by   29%   driven by lower sales volume. International segment revenues   increased   by   2%  , driven by mid single digit organic growth, offset by a low single digit unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the low single digit impact of revenues from prior year dispositions.  
    
  Oil and gas revenues decreased by approximately 1%, driven by many of the Company s customers to curtail spending, but   remained the Company s most significant vertical market, comprising approximately 55% of total Company revenues in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017  , compared with 56% in the first quarter of fiscal   2016  . The Company s top ten customers comprised approximately 36% of total revenues in both the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.  One customer, BP plc., accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit   decreased   by   $1.2 million  , or   2.4%  , in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017  , on a sales decline of   6.3%  .  
    
  Gross profit by segment for the   three months ended August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   was as follows:

Three months 
    
  As a percentage of revenues, gross profit was   29.7%   and   28.5%   for the   first   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively. Service segment gross profit margins increased to   27.2%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to   26.6%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2016  . The 60 basis point increase was primarily driven by improved sales mix.  International segment gross margins increased to   33.0%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2017   compared with   29.2%   in the prior year. The 380 basis point increase was due to improvement across our largest country locations, driven by improvements in technical labor utilization, sales mix and overhead utilization.  Products and Systems segment gross margin improved by 500 basis points to   50.2%   compared with   45.2%   in the prior year, driven by improved sales mix.

Income from Operations 
    
  The following table shows a reconciliation of the income from operations to income before special items for each of the Company's three segments and for the Company in total: 

Three months 
  For the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , income from operations (GAAP) decreased   $1.8 million  , or   14%  , compared with the prior year s   first   quarter and income before special items (non-GAAP) decreased   $0.3 million  , or   2%  . As a percentage of revenues, income before special items improved by 30 basis points to   7.0%   in the first quarter of fiscal   2017   from   6.7%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal   2016  . 
    
  Operating expenses increased   $0.6 million   compared with the prior year s   first   quarter, driven by an increase in acquisition-related expense from the Services segment of   $1.3 million  , offset by a   $0.9 million   decline in recurring expenses. The recurring expense decrease was driven by the International segment, which decreased   $1.2 million  , primarily due to foreign currency gains and the disposal of subsidiaries in fiscal 2016, offset by a   $0.7 million   increase in professional fees for the Corporate segment.   Products and Systems segment was flat from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016.  
    
  Interest Expense 

25 

     Table of Contents  

Interest expense was approximately   $0.8 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   first   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The decrease was primarily related to the payment of seller notes related to acquisitions and the net paydown of the Company's line of credit under its Credit Agreement. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s effective income tax rate was approximately   36%   and   38%   for the   first   quarters of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  The decrease was primarily due to lower discrete items and lower expected annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2017, due to a larger portion of income expected to be generated by the International segment, which generally has lower statutory tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Flows Table 
    
  Cash flows are summarized in the table below: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  During the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , cash provided by operating activities was   $17.3 million  , an increase of   $1.1 million  , or   7%  . The improvement was primarily attributable to the     timing of collections, offset by payments of accrued expenses  . 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  During the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , cash used in investing activities was   $5.0 million  , compared with a cash outflow of   $4.4 million   in the comparable period of the prior year. The first three months of fiscal 2017 included   $1.2 million   outflow related to acquisitions, compared with no acquisition activity for the comparable period in fiscal 2016. Cash used for capital expenditures was   $4.0 million   and   $4.6 million   in the first three months of fiscal   2017   and   2016  , respectively.  
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used by financing activities was   $17.8 million   for the   three months ended August 31, 2016  . The Company utilized the   $13.3 million   of free cash flow generated in the first three months of fiscal 2017 to reduce its debt and capital lease obligations by $16.7 million.  For the comparable period in fiscal 2016, the Company utilized most of the   $11.6 million   of free cash flow to reduce its debt and capital lease obligations by $9.2 million.    
    
  Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash equivalents was a net reduction of   $0.8 million   in the first three months of fiscal   2017  , compared to   $0.1 million   for the first three months of fiscal   2016  , primarily driven by exchange rates for fiscal 2017, notably the impact of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. 
    
  Cash Balance and Credit Facility Borrowings 
    
  The terms of our Credit Agreement have not changed from those set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our 2016 Annual Report under the Section  Liquidity and Capital Resources , under the heading  Cash Balance and Credit Facility Borrowings,  and Note 10

  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  During the   three months ended August 31, 2016  , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s quarter ended   August 31, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting.

  1.1        REGISTERED OFFICE. 
    
  The registered office of Mistras Group, Inc. (the    Company   ) shall be fixed in the Company s certificate of incorporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time (as so amended and/or restated, the    Certificate   ). 
    
  1.2        OTHER OFFICES.

  ARTICLE II 
    
  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
    
  2.1        PLACE OF MEETINGS. 
    
  Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as designated by the Board. The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the    DGCL   ). In the absence of any such designation or determination, stockholders  meetings shall be held at the Company s principal place of business. 
    
  2.2        ANNUAL MEETING. 
    
  The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the Board. At the annual meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted. 
    
  2.3        SPECIAL MEETING. 
    
  (A)        General.        Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate, special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time, for any purpose or purposes, only by (i) the Chairperson of the Board, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer or (iii) by the Board acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board. Subject to   Section 2.3(B)  , a special meeting of stockholders shall also be called by the secretary of the Company upon the written request of one or more stockholders entitled to cast not less than thirty-five percent (35%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast at that meeting. 
    
  (B)        Stockholder Requested Special Meetings.        (1) Any stockholder of record seeking to have stockholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the secretary (the    Record Date Request Notice   ) by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the  

Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to request a special meeting (the    Request Record Date   ). The Record Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, shall be signed by one or more stockholders of record as of the date of signature (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the Record Date Request Notice), shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such stockholder that must be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ). Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date. The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors, within ten (10) days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the tenth (10th) day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the secretary. 
    
  (2)        In order for any stockholder to request a special meeting, one or more written requests for a special meeting signed by stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the request) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than thirty-five percent (35%) (the    Special Meeting Percentage   ) of all of the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting (the    Special Meeting Request   ) shall be delivered to the secretary. In addition, the Special Meeting Request (a) shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to those lawful matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the secretary), (b) shall bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or such agent) signing the Special Meeting Request, (c) shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Company s books, of each stockholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed) and the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Company which are owned by each such stockholder, and the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned by such stockholder beneficially but not of record, (d) shall be sent to the secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested, and (e) shall be received by the secretary within sixty (60) days after the Request Record Date. Any requesting stockholder (or agent duly authorized in a writing accompanying the revocation or the Special Meeting Request) may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the secretary. 
    
  (3)        The secretary shall inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice of meeting (including the Company s proxy materials). The secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required by paragraph (2) of this   Section 2.3(B)  , the secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the mailing of any notice of the meeting. 
    
  (4)        Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors, whoever has called the meeting. In the case of any special meeting called by the secretary upon the request of stockholders (a    Stockholder Requested Meeting   ), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be  

designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Stockholder Requested Meeting shall be not more than 60 days after the record date for such meeting (the    Meeting Record Date    and provided further that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten (10) days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the secretary (the    Delivery Date   ), a date and time for a Stockholder Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time on the 60th day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 60th day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder Requested Meeting within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Company. In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting. In the case of any Stockholder Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30th day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. The Board of Directors may revoke the notice for any Stockholder Requested Meeting in the event that the requesting stockholders fail to comply with the provisions of paragraph (3) of this   Section 2.3(B)  . 
    
  (5)        If written revocations of requests for the special meeting have been delivered to the secretary and the result is that stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in writing), as of the Request Record Date, entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage have delivered, and not revoked, requests for a special meeting to the secretary, the secretary shall: (i) if the notice of meeting has not already been mailed, refrain from mailing the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked such requests written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting, or (ii) if the notice of meeting has been mailed, send to all requesting stockholders who have not revoked requests for a special meeting written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting and the secretary s intention to revoke the notice of the meeting, and then revoke the notice of the meeting at any time before ten (10) days before the commencement of the meeting. Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting. 
    
  (6)        The Board of Directors, the Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may appoint independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the Company for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting Request received by the secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such purported request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the secretary until the earlier of (i) five Business Days after receipt by the secretary of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Company that the valid requests received by the secretary represent at least the Special Meeting Percentage. Nothing contained in this paragraph (6) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Company or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 

(7)        For purposes of these bylaws,  Business Day  shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
    
  2.4        NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS  MEETINGS. 
    
  All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with either   Section 2.5   or   Section 8.1   of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is called. Any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders may be postponed, and, unless the Certificate provides otherwise, any special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled by resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. 
    
  Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or 
   agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 
    
  Whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, to any stockholder to whom (A) notice of two (2) consecutive annual meetings or (B) all, and at least two (2), payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at such person s address as shown on the records of the Company and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such person shall deliver to the Company a written notice setting forth such person s then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. 
    
  The exception in   subsection (A)   of the above paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission. 
    
  2.5        MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE. 
    
  Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given: 
    
  (A)        if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder s address as it appears on the Company s records; 

(B)        if electronically transmitted, as provided in   Section 8.1   of these bylaws; or 
    
  (C)        otherwise, when delivered. 
    
  An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company or of the transfer agent or any other agent of the Company that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 
    
  Notice may be waived in accordance with   Section 7.12   of these bylaws. 
    
  2.6        QUORUM. 
    
  The holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 
    
  2.7        ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE. 
    
  When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place if any thereof, and the means of remote communications if any by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.   
    
  The stockholders of the Company shall not have the right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors of the Company. 
    
  2.10        STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING. 

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Company must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. 
    
  2.11        RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS. 
    
  In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other such action. 
    
  If the Board does not fix a record date in accordance with these bylaws and applicable law: 
  (A)        Except as provided in Section 2.3(B)(4) of these bylaws, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. 
    
  (B)        The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
    
  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;   provided  ,   however  , that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
    
  2.12        PROXIES. 
    
  Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law and filed with the secretary of the Company, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A stockholder may also authorize another person or persons to act for him, her or it as proxy in the manner(s) provided under Section 212(c) of the DGCL or as otherwise provided under Delaware law. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.

The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the Company s principal place of business. 

In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Company. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

  7.12        WAIVER OF NOTICE. 
    
  Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting solely for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or  

convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate or these bylaws. 

ARTICLE VIII 
    
  NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION 
    
  8.1        NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. 
    
  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Company under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: 
    
  (A)        the Company is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Company in accordance with such consent; and 
    
  (B)        such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. 
    
  However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 
    
  Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 
    
  (i)        if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 
    
  (ii)        if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 
    
  (iii)        if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and 
    
  (iv)        if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 
    
  An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 

8.2        DEFINITION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. 

An  electronic transmission  means any form of communication, including without limitation an email communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. 
    
  8.3        INAPPLICABILITY. 
    
  Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the DGCL. 
    
  ARTICLE IX 
    
  INDEMNIFICATION OF AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES TO DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
    
  9.1        POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS OTHER THAN THOSE BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY. 
    
  Subject to   Section 9.3   of these bylaws, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the Company or any predecessor of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys  fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of   nolo contendere   or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person s conduct was unlawful. 

9.2        POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY. 
    
  Subject to   Section 9.3   of these bylaws, the Company shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or officer of the Company or any predecessor of the Company, or is or was a director or officer of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses  

(including attorneys  fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 
    
  9.3        AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. 
    
  Any indemnification under this   Article IX   (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in   Section 9.1   or   Section 9.2   of these bylaws, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is either a director or officer at the time of such determination or a former director or officer, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders (but only if a majority of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination). To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys  fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 
    
  9.4        GOOD FAITH DEFINED. 
    
  For purposes of any determination under   Section 9.3   of these bylaws, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful, if such person s action is based on the records or books of account of the Company or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Company or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Company or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or another enterprise. The term  another enterprise  as used in this   Section 9.4   shall mean any other Company or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this   Section 9.4   shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in   Section 9.1   or   Section 9.2   of these bylaws, as the case may be. 
    
  9.5        INDEMNIFICATION BY A COURT. 
    
  Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under   Section 9.3   of this   Article IX  , and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to  

the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under   Section 9.1   and   Section 9.2   of these bylaws. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in   Section 9.1   or   Section 9.2   of these bylaws, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under   Section 9.3   of these bylaws nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this   Section 9.5   shall be given to the Company promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
    
  9.6        EXPENSES PAYABLE IN ADVANCE. 
    
  To the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law, expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding;   provided  ,   however  , that if the DGCL requires, an advance of expenses incurred by any person in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in this   Article IX  . 

9.7        NONEXCLUSIVITY OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. 
    
  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this   Article IX   shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate, any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Company that indemnification of the persons specified in   Section 9.1   and   Section 9.2   of these bylaws shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this   Article IX   shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in   Section 9.1   or   Section 9.2   of these bylaws but whom the Company has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. The Company is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law. 
    
  9.8        INSURANCE. 
    
  To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable law, the Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person s status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this   Article IX  . 

9.9        CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. 
    
  For purposes of this   Article IX  , references to  the Company  shall include, in addition to the resulting company, any constituent company (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent company, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent company serving at the request of such constituent company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this   Article IX   with respect to the resulting or surviving company as such person would have with respect to such constituent company if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this   Article IX  , references to  fines  shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to  serving at the request of the Company  shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner  not opposed to the best interests of the Company  as referred to in this   Article IX  . 
    
  9.10        SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. 
    
  The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this   Article IX   shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal and legal representatives of such a person. 
    
  9.11        LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything contained in this   Article IX   to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by   Section 9.5   of these bylaws), the Company shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board. 
    
  9.12        INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.

  Sotirios Vahaviolos 
    
  Re:        Repurchase of Mistras Common Stock 
    
  Dear Sotirios: 
    
  This letter agreement sets for the terms by which you will sell to Mistras Group, Inc. (the  Company ) and the Company will repurchase from you up to 1 million shares of the Company s common stock owned by you.  As used in this agreement, the term  Shares  shall mean shares of the Company s common stock owned by you and the term  common stock  shall mean Company common stock.  
    
  The following are the terms of the repurchase: 
    
  1.  Mistras shall purchase up to 1 million Shares directly from you at the rate of $2 million worth of Shares per month. 
    
  2.  The repurchase of Shares for each month shall be completed within 10 business days after the end of the month. 
    
  3.  At the end of each month, the average of the daily closing price of the Company s common stock for each trading date during the month shall be calculated ( ADCP ).  The price ( Purchase Price ) used to determine the number of Shares repurchased by the Company for that month shall be 98% of the ADCP for that month, a 2% discount for the Company.  The daily closing price shall be based upon the closing price quoted by the New York Stock Exchange. 
    
  4.  The number of Shares to be repurchased in any month shall be determined by dividing $2 million by the Purchase Price, rounded to the nearest whole share. 
    
  5.  No Shares shall be repurchased for a given month if the ADCP for that month is below $21.00 per share or above $29.00 per share. 
    
  6.  The first month for which any Shares may be repurchased by the Company pursuant to this agreement shall be based upon the ADCP for September 2016, with the actual repurchase occurring in October 2016. 
    
  7.  For the month in which the cumulative number of Shares repurchased shall reach 1 million Shares, the Company shall only repurchase a sufficient number of Shares so that the total number of Shares repurchased by the Company equals 1 million.   
    
  8.  This agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of the following to occur:  (a) 1 million Shares are repurchased by the Company, (b) for a period of 4 consecutive months, no Shares are repurchased because the ADCP for each of those months was either below the minimum or above the maximum ADCP set forth in 5 above, or (c) upon written notice by either party, provided that  

such notice shall not impact the repurchase of Shares for the month immediately preceding the month in which notice of termination was given. 
    
  9.  If this agreement is terminated pursuant to 7(c), you and the Company shall not enter into an agreement of this nature for at least 6 months. 
    
  10.  You represent that you are the legal and beneficial owner of all the Shares to be repurchased by the Company, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, and that you have the legal right and authority to sell the Shares to the Company. 
    
  11.  The Company shall have no obligation to repurchase any Shares if the Chief Financial Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company determines that the Company s capital is or will be impaired as a result of a repurchase of Shares, as provided in Section 160 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or that the Company is otherwise not permitted to repurchase Shares pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, any other requirement of law or the rules of the stock exchange on which shares of the Company s common stock are listed for trading.   
    
  12.  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 
    
  Agreed and approved:

Mistras Group, Inc., et al.  , No. CGC-15-545291. (Cal. Super. Ct., San Francisco filed Apr. 13, 2015) (   Viceral   ). Defendant removed the   Viceral   action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on May 15, 2015, pursuant to federal question jurisdiction.  
  2.  On April 10, 2015, Plaintiff David Krueger filed a related class action complaint against Defendant Mistras Group, Inc. in the Kern County Superior Court, entitled   David Krueger, et al. v. Mistras Group, Inc.et al.,   No. S-1500-CV-284570 (Cal. Super. Ct., Kern filed Apr. 10, 2015) (   Krueger   ). Defendant also removed the   Krueger   action to federal court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. section 1332(d). 
  3.  The Parties in both actions met and conferred to coordinate the action. The Parties agreed that   Krueger   would be combined with   Viceral   before the Northern District of California by way of filing this Consolidated First Amended Complaint in   Viceral   and adding the   Krueger   parties, claims, and counsel. The   Krueger   Plaintiffs requested dismissal of the   Krueger   action before the Eastern District by way of a stipulation. On September 9, 2015, the   Krueger   Court granted the   Krueger   Parties  stipulated request for dismissal and dismissed the case. Thereafter, on November 24, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated First Amended Complaint in this matter.  
  4.  Separate and apart from Plaintiffs  class claims, on May 15, 2015, Plaintiff David Krueger filed a complaint against Defendant Mistras Group Inc., in Kern County Superior Court, entitled   David Krueger, Individually, v. Mistras Group, Inc., et al.  , No. BCV-15-100064 (   Krueger Individual Lawsuit   ). On June 30, 2015, Defendant also removed this lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California based on diversity jurisdiction.  
  5.  After Defendant answered the Complaint, the Parties agreed to exchange informal discovery and participate in a mediation. Following additional settlement negotiations spearheaded by the Mediator after mediation, the Parties reached a settlement, which is memorialized in this Stipulation of Settlement.  

6.  Defendant denies any liability and wrongdoing of any kind associated with the claims alleged in the Lawsuit, and further denies that the Lawsuit is appropriate for collective or class treatment for any purpose other than this Settlement. Defendant contends, among other things, that it has complied at all times with the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code, the Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders, and the California Business and Professions Code.  
  7.  Plaintiffs believe that the Lawsuit is meritorious and that class and collective certification is appropriate.  
  8.  Class Counsel has conducted a thorough investigation into the facts of the Lawsuit, including informal discovery, a review of company documents and interviews with Class Members and depositions of 30(b)(6) witnesses. Class Counsel is knowledgeable about and has done extensive research with respect to the applicable law and potential defenses to the claims of the Class. Class Counsel has diligently pursued an investigation of the Class Members' claims against Defendant. Based on the forgoing data and on their own independent investigation and evaluation, Class Counsel is of the opinion that the settlement with Defendant for the consideration and on the terms set forth in this Stipulation of Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and is in the best interest of the Class Members in light of all known facts and circumstances, including the risk of significant delay and uncertainty associated with litigation, various defenses asserted by Defendant, and numerous other issues. Defendant agrees not to dispute that the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  
  9.  The Parties stipulate and agree to the certification of the Class for purposes of this Settlement only. Should, for whatever reason, the Court not grant Final Approval, the Parties  stipulation to class certification as part of the Settlement shall become null and void   ab initio   and shall have no bearing on, and shall not be admissible in connection with, the issue of whether or not certification would be appropriate in a non-settlement context. Defendant expressly reserves its right and declares that it intends to oppose class certification vigorously should this Settlement not be granted Final Approval. 
    
           C. 
    Settlement Components 
     1.  The Settlement in this Lawsuit shall have five components: (1) the Individual Settlement Payments; (2) the Service Payments; (3) the Fee and Expense Award; (4) the Administration Costs; and (5) the PAGA Payment. All of these components are included in the Maximum Settlement Amount and shall be deducted prior to the California Settlement Allocation and FLSA Settlement Allocation.  
  (a)         Payroll Taxes:     The Maximum Settlement Amount does not include the Payroll Taxes, which shall be paid by Defendant separate and apart from the Maximum Settlement Amount. The Payroll Taxes will be computed by the Settlement Administrator based on the amounts paid to the Claimants. The Settlement Administrator shall be responsible for making all necessary payments and government filings in connection with such payments.  
  (b)         Calculation of the Individual Settlement Payments  :   The Settlement Administrator shall have the authority and obligation to calculate the amounts of Individual Settlement Payments in accordance with the methodology set forth in this Stipulation of Settlement and orders of the Court. The Parties recognize and agree that the claims for relief in the Lawsuit are extremely difficult to determine with any certainty for any given year, or at all, and are subject to myriad differing calculations and formulas. The Parties agree that the formula for allocating the Individual Settlement Payments to Claimants provided herein is reasonable and that the payments provided herein are designed to provide a fair settlement to such persons, in light of the uncertainties of the compensation alleged to be owed to the Class and the calculation of such amounts.  
  It shall be the responsibility of the Settlement Administrator to timely and properly withhold from Individual Settlement Payments payable to Claimants all applicable payroll and employment taxes, but not federal, state, and local income taxes, and to prepare and deliver the necessary tax documentation and, thereafter, to cause the appropriate deposits of withholding taxes and informational and other tax return filing to occur. Each Claimant's share of all applicable payroll and employment taxes withheld and deposited with the applicable governmental authorities in accordance with this Stipulation of Settlement shall be a part of, and paid out of, the Individual Settlement Payment to each Claimant. Each Claimant will be responsible for paying all applicable state, local, and federal income taxes on all amounts the Claimant receives pursuant to this Stipulation of Settlement.  

The Parties have agreed that the Individual Settlement Payments will be calculated on the basis of the number of Individual Work Weeks, as applicable. The Individual Settlement Payments for the Claimants in the California Class will be calculated by multiplying 65% of the Net Settlement Proceeds by each California Class Member's California Percentage Share. The Individual Settlement Payments for the Claimants in the FLSA Class will be calculated by multiplying 35% of the Net Settlement Proceeds by each FLSA Class Member's FLSA Percentage Share.  
  The Individual Settlement Payments will be allocated as follows: 1/3 to settlement of wage claims, which will be subject to required tax withholdings; 1/3 to penalties, and 1/3 to interest which will be paid without withholding any amount. The portion allocated to wages shall be reported on an IRS Form W-2, and the portion allocated to liquidated damages, interest and statutory penalties shall be reported on an IRS Form 1099. 
  (c)         Allocation of Unclaimed Funds  :   If there are unclaimed funds due to: (1) California Class Members submitting Exclusion Letters; those unclaimed funds shall be added to the portion of the Net Settlement fund allocated to the California Class Members. If there are unclaimed funds due to (2) California Class members not cashing their checks, those unclaimed funds shall escheat to the California Industrial Relations Unclaimed Wages Fund. If there are unclaimed funds due to FLSA Class Members who did not elect to opt-in to this action pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C.  216(b) by cashing the check for the FLSA settlement award, those unclaimed funds shall escheat to the California Industrial Relations Unclaimed Wages Fund.  
  (d)         Service Payments  :   Defendant agrees not to challenge Class Counsel's request for Service Payments to the Named Plaintiffs, Edgar Viceral and David Krueger. The Service Payments will be paid in addition to the Named Plaintiffs  Individual Settlement Payments. Should the Service Payments approved by the Court be less than the amount sought, the difference shall be added to the Net Settlement Proceeds prior to the allocations to the California Class and FLSA Class. An IRS Form 1099 will be issued to Plaintiffs Edgar Viceral and David Krueger in connection with the Service Payment.  
  (e)         Class Counsel's Fees and Costs  :   Defendant agrees not to challenge Class Counsel's request for its Fee and Expense Award. Should the Fee and Expense Award approved by the Court be less than the amount sought, the difference shall be added to the Net Settlement Proceeds prior to the allocations to the California Class and FLSA Class. A Form 1099 will be issued to Class Counsel. Payment of the Fee and Expense Award to Class Counsel shall constitute full satisfaction of any obligation to pay any amounts to any person, attorney or law firm for attorneys' fees, expenses or costs in the Lawsuit incurred by any attorney on behalf of Plaintiffs or the Class, and shall relieve Defendant and Defendant's Counsel of any other claims or liability to any other attorney or law firm for any attorneys' fees, expenses and/or costs to which any of them may claim to be entitled on behalf of Plaintiffs and/or the Class. Upon receipt of the Fee and Expense Award, Class Counsel, Plaintiff and the Class will be deemed to have released Defendant from any and all claims for fees and costs resulting from the Lawsuit. 
           D. 
    Release by the California Class.  
     1.  Upon the Effective Date, the California Class Members (other than those who submit an Exclusion Letter) will fully release the California Class Released Claims and agree not to sue or otherwise make a claim against any of the Released Parties for the California Class Released Claims. The Individual Settlement Payments shall be paid to California Class Claimants specifically in exchange for the release of the Released Parties from the California Class Released Claims and the covenant not to sue concerning the California Class Released Claims.  
  2.  The release of claims provided by this Stipulation of Settlement includes California Class Members' California Class Released Claims, which a California Class Member does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor against Defendant as of the date of Final Approval. Each California Class Member, including Plaintiff, waives all rights and benefits afforded by section 1542 of the California Civil Code as to their California Class Released Claims, and does so understanding the significance of that waiver. Section 1542 provides:  
  A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor. 

E. 
    Release by the FLSA Class 
     1.  FLSA Class Members who elect to opt-in to this action pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C.  216(b) by cashing the check for the FLSA settlement award will fully release the FLSA Class Released Claims and agree not to sue or otherwise make a claim against any of the Released Parties for the FLSA Class Released Claims. The Individual Settlement Payments shall be paid to FLSA Class Claimants specifically in exchange for the release of the Released Parties from the FLSA Class Released Claims and the covenant not to sue concerning the FLSA Class Released Claims.  
  2.  The release of claims provided by this Stipulation of Settlement includes FLSA Class Members' FLSA Class Released Claims which a FLSA Class Member does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor against Defendant as of the date of Final Approval.  
  F.  Release of Additional Claims   Rights by Plaintiffs  
  1.  Upon the Effective Date, Plaintiff Edgar Viceral hereby fully releases the Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, obligations, causes of action, rights, or liabilities of any kind under local, state or federal law, which have been or could have been asserted against the Released Parties arising out of or relating to Plaintiff s employment by Defendant and termination thereof (as applicable) and/or any other event, act, occurrence, or omission taking place on or before the date the Court grants Final Approval of this Settlement.

    Settlement Approval Procedure 
     1.  This Settlement Agreement will become final and effective upon occurrence of all of the following events described in this paragraph:

  (1) Submission of the Settlement Agreement to the Court for preliminary approval and certification for settlement purposes only of the California Class.  
  (2) Entry of an order by the Court (a) granting preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, including conditional certification of the California Class for settlement purposes only, (b)  

appointing Class Counsel; (c) appointing the Class Representatives for both the Class and Collective; and (d) appointment of the Settlement Administrator.  
  (3) Court approval of the form and content of the Notice Packet, advising the members of the California Class of the material terms and provisions of this Agreement, the procedure for approval thereof, and their rights with respect thereto.  
  (4) Filing by Class Counsel, on or before the date of the final approval hearing, the Settlement Administrator s verification, in writing, that the Class Notice to the California Class Members has been disseminated in accordance with the Court s order.  
  (5) Occurrence of the  Effective Date .  
           (c)  
    For the FLSA Class  :  
     (1) Submission of the Settlement Agreement to the Court for final approval of the Collective settlement at the same time as the hearing for preliminary approval of the California Class settlement.  
  (2) Entry of an order by the Court granting Final Approval of the Settlement Agreement as to the FLSA Class.  
  (3) Court approval of the form and content of the Notice Packet, advising the FLSA Class Members of the settlement to be mailed to all FLSA Class Members along with their settlement checks upon the occurrence of the Effective Date of the settlement for the California Class. If the Effective Date does not occur, then the settlement of the Collective will be null and void.  
  2.  As soon as practicable after this Settlement Agreement has been signed by all Parties and their counsel, Class Counsel shall move the Court for preliminary approval of this Settlement Agreement as to the California Class Members, and request an order: 
    
  (a)         Preliminarily approving this Settlement as to the California Class Members as fair, reasonable, and adequate; and  
  (b) Finally approving this Settlement as to the FLSA Class Members as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  
  3.  Prior to Plaintiffs  Counsel filing a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement as to the California Class and Final Approval as to the FLSA Class, Defendant will submit to Plaintiffs  Counsel a declaration signed by a corporate representative attesting that Mistras will use reasonable efforts to maintain legally compliant employment practices to ensure compliance with wage and hour laws.  
  4.  Plaintiffs will request that the Court set a hearing as soon as possible to consider Preliminary Approval of the Settlement. In conjunction with such hearing, Class Counsel shall submit this Stipulation of Settlement, together with the exhibits attached hereto, and any other documents necessary to implement the Settlement.  
  5.  Class Counsel shall provide a copy of the draft motion for preliminary approval as to the California Class and final approval as to the FLSA Class to Defendant's Counsel for review a reasonable time, but not less than three (3) Court days before filing it with the Court.  
  H.  Notice and Claim Process.  
  1.  Within fifteen (15) calendar days after entry of the order granting Preliminary Approval as to the California Class and Final Approval as to the FLSA Class, Defendant shall provide to the Settlement Administrator a list of all California Class and FLSA Class Members, including their name, Social Security number, last known address, telephone number, and Individual Work Weeks.  

2.  Within ten (10) calendar days after receiving the Class Member list from Defendant, the Settlement Administrator shall send the Notice Packet via first class mail to all California Class Members. Prior to the initial mailing, the Settlement Administrator will check the addresses provided by Defendant through the National Change of Address System.  
  3.  If an original Notice Packet is returned as undeliverable with a forwarding address provided by the United States Postal Service, the Settlement Administrator will promptly resend a Notice Packet to that forwarding address. If an original Notice Packet is returned as undeliverable without a forwarding address, the Settlement Administrator will make reasonable efforts to locate forwarding addresses, including a skip trace, and if it obtains a more recent address, will resend a Notice Packet, along with a brief letter for California Class Members stating that the recipient of the Notice Packet has until the original deadline set forth on the Notice or seven (7) days after the re-mailing of the Notice Packet (whichever is later) to respond.  
  4.  At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the final approval hearing, the Settlement Administrator will provide a declaration of due diligence and proof of mailing with regard to the mailing of the Notice Packet to counsel for all Parties.  
  5.  To the extent a California Class Member or FLSA Class Member disputes the Individual Work Weeks shown in his or her Form, the Claimant may produce evidence to the Settlement Administrator establishing the dates he or she contends to have worked for Defendant. Defendant's records will be presumed determinative. The Settlement Administrator shall notify counsel for the Parties of any disputes. Defendant shall review its records and provide further 
    
  information to the Settlement Administrator, as necessary. The Settlement Administrator shall resolve any disputes and notify counsel for the Parties of its decision.  
    
  6.  The Settlement Administrator's determination of eligibility for any Individual Settlement Payments under the terms of this Stipulation of Settlement shall be conclusive, final and binding on all Parties and all Class Members, so long as the Settlement Administrator has first consulted with the Parties regarding any disputes or questions as to eligibility. 
  7.  The Notice to the California Class Members shall provide that California Class Members who wish to exclude themselves from the Settlement must submit an Exclusion Letter. Any California Class Member who properly requests exclusion using this procedure will not be entitled to any payment from the Settlement and will not be bound by the Stipulation of Settlement or have any right to object, appeal or comment thereon. California Class Members who fail to submit an Exclusion Letter shall be bound by all terms of the Stipulation of Settlement and any judgment entered in the Lawsuit if the Settlement is approved by the Court.  
  8.  If 5% or more of the California Class Members submit an Exclusion Letter, Defendant shall have the option of canceling the settlement and all actions taken in its furtherance will be null and void. Defendant must exercise this right within seven (7) calendar days after the Settlement Administrator notifies the Parties of the number of Exclusion Letters received, which the Settlement Administrator must do within two (2) business days after the Objection/Exclusion Deadline.  
  9.  In order to object to the Settlement, a California Class Member must file his or her objection with the Court no later than the Objection/Exclusion Deadline, or seven (7) days after the re-mailing of the Notice Packet to that Class Member, whichever is later. FLSA Settlement Awards shall be paid by the Settlement Administrator to FLSA Class Members fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of the Effective Date and checks for the FLSA Class Members shall be accompanied by the FLSA Class Notice. The Settlement Administrator shall provide Class Counsel and Defendant s Counsel with a final statement listing all FLSA Class Members and identifying the number of weeks worked by each FLSA Class Member, and the approximate Settlement award to each FLSA Class Member at least five (5) business days before the FLSA Class Notices are sent to the FLSA Class Members. Prior to the initial mailing, the Settlement Administrator will check the addresses provided by Defendant through the National Change of Address System. If an original Notice Packet is returned as undeliverable with a forwarding address provided by the United States Postal Service, the Settlement Administrator will promptly resend a Notice Packet to that forwarding address. If an original Notice Packet is returned as undeliverable without a forwarding address, the Settlement Administrator will make reasonable efforts to locate forwarding addresses, including a skip trace, and if it obtains a more recent address, will resend a Notice Packet. FLSA Class Members must elect to opt-in to this action pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C.  216(b) by cashing the check for the FLSA settlement award.  

10.  Defendant will provide the Settlement Administrator with sufficient funds to make all payments due to Plaintiff, Class Counsel, the LWDA, the Settlement Administrator, and the Claimants, plus any owed Payroll Taxes as soon as practicable, but no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Date.  
  11.  The Settlement Administrator will mail or wire all required payments no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the Effective Date. If a Claimant's check is returned to the Settlement Administrator, the Settlement Administrator will make all reasonable efforts to re-mail it to the Claimant at his or her correct address. It is expressly understood and agreed that the checks 
    
  for the Individual Settlement Payments will become void and no longer available if not cashed within one hundred eighty days (180) days after mailing. Any funds from uncashed checks for Claimants shall escheat to the California Industrial Relations Unclaimed Wages Fund.  
  Upon completion of administration of the Settlement, the Settlement Administrator shall provide written certification of such completion to the Court, Class Counsel and Defendant's Counsel.  
  12.  No person shall have any claim against Defendant, Defendant's Counsel, Plaintiffs, the Class, Class Counsel or the Settlement Administrator based on mailings, distributions and payments made in accordance with this Stipulation of Settlement.  
  I.  Motion for Final Approval. 
  1.  Plaintiff shall timely file the motion for final approval of the Settlement as to the California Class Members and request entry of the Final Approval Order and Judgment. In a reasonable time, but not less than three (3) business days prior to filing the motion for final approval of the Settlement, Class Counsel shall provide a draft of the motion to Defendant's Counsel for review. 
  J.  No Effect on Employee Benefits.  
  1.  The Individual Settlement Payments and the Service Payments shall not have any effect on the eligibility for, or calculation of, any employee benefits   (e.g.   vacation, retirement plans, etc.) of Claimants or Plaintiffs. No benefit, including but not limited to 401K benefits, shall increase or accrue as a result of any payment made as a result of this Settlement.  
  K.  Publicity.  
  1.  Plaintiffs and Class Counsel will keep the terms of the settlement confidential until the preliminary approval papers are filed. This shall not restrict Class Counsel from posting information on their respective firm websites to notify Class Members of the Settlement and provide them with the Notice, or communicating directly with Class Members about the Settlement.  
  L.  Voiding the Agreement.  
  1.  In the event of any of the following: (i) the Court does not approve the scope of the California Class Released Claims or FLSA Class Released Claims; (ii) the Court finds the Maximum Settlement Amount is insufficient to warrant approval; or (iii) 5% or more of the California Class Members submit an Exclusion Letter, Defendant may elect to reject this Settlement and the Stipulation of Settlement shall be null and void   ab initio   and any order or judgment entered by the Court in furtherance of this Settlement shall be treated as withdrawn or vacated by stipulation of the Parties. In such case, the Class Members and Defendant shall be returned to their respective statuses as of the date immediately prior to the execution of this Stipulation of Settlement. In the event an appeal is filed from the Final Approval Order and Judgment, or any other appellate review is sought prior to the Effective Date, administration of the Settlement shall be stayed pending final resolution of the appeal or other appellate review.
