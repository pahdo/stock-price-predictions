1.    
 
   The Company and Significant Accounting Policies      
     
   The Company   
     
  Salon Media Group, Inc. ( Salon , the  Company  or  We ) is an internet news and social networking company that produces Salon.com, a content Website. Salon was originally incorporated in July 1995 in California and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999. Salon operates in one business segment.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  These interim financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly Salon's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. These financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, which are included in Salon s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on June 24, 2016. Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, these financial statements do not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. The results for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the expected results for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  
     
  These financial statements contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016 of $126,266. In addition, we expect to incur a net loss from operations for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. The Company has operated principally with the assistance of interest free advances from related parties. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
  Our operating forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 anticipates smaller operating losses. We estimate we will require approximately $0.8 million - $1.0 million in additional funding to meet our operating needs for the balance of our fiscal year. Operating costs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were reduced by 11% compared to the same period in last year, and we have taken additional steps to better match our operating expense with revenues. However, we commenced collective bargaining with the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. ( WGAE ) in November 2015 and until the negotiations are finalized we will not have a clear idea of any potential increase in our budget.  If planned revenues continue to be less than expected, or if planned expenses are more than expected, the cash shortfall may be higher, which will result in a commensurate increase in required financing.

   (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)   
   (unaudited)   
     
   Cash   
     
  Cash consists of cash on deposit with banks and have original maturities of three months or less.  
     
   Concentration of Credit Risk   
     
  Financial instruments that potentially subject Salon to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but do not require collateral.  We provide an allowance for credit losses that we periodically adjust to reflect our management s expectation of future losses.   
     
  Two customers accounted for approximately 22% and 13% of net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Two customers accounted for approximately 25% and 11% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. One customer accounted for approximately 24% of net revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016. One customer accounted for approximately 28% of net revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Four customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 ranging from approximately 10.2% to 19%. Five customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016 ranging from approximately 10% to 17%.  
     
   Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method of accounting. The estimated fair value of the stock options granted is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock. A summary of our stock incentive plans is discussed in Note 3 to our financial statements.   
     
  We granted options to acquire a total of 300,900 shares under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.         The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:   

We applied the expected term of 6.3 years during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, to more appropriately estimate expectations of exercise behavior of the options. We will consistently apply this going forward until we are able to develop a refined method of estimating the period of time until option exercise. The expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of Salon s stock over a period equal to the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a term equivalent to the service period of the stock options. We have not paid dividends in the past.

   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)   
   (unaudited)   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense was $2,249. Salon expects this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $314 during the remainder of fiscal 2017; $628 during fiscal 2018; $611 during fiscal 2019; $574 during fiscal 2020 and $122 during fiscal 2021. The expected amortization reflects outstanding stock option awards as of September 30, 2016 expected to vest.  
     
   Reclassifications   
     
  Certain reclassifications, not affecting previously reported net income or loss or total assets, have been made to the previously issued financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.  
     
   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17 to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has adopted this new guidance with no material impact on its financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance and does not believe adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 as part of its Simplification Initiative. The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees and are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance and does not believe adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This ASU modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU No. 2016-13 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently reviewing the impact of this new guidance and does not believe adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.

   (unaudited)   
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230).  This ASU is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. We adopted ACU No. 2016-15 in the third quarter of 2016 with no material impact to our financial statements.  

2. Borrowing Agreements   
     
   Short-term Borrowings   
     
  In May 2007, we finalized a borrowing agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. that allows us to borrow up to $1,000 at a rate of prime less 0.25%. In September 2016, this credit agreement was transferred to Raymond James and Associates, Inc. (Raymond James) after Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. sold its accounts. Our obligations under this agreement are guaranteed in their entirety by our Chairman. The line of credit has been fully drawn as of September 30, 2016. Raymond James may demand repayment of amounts borrowed at any time. Additionally, our Chairman may also choose to terminate his guarantee, which would trigger a demand for repayment. As of September 30, 2016, accrued interest on short-term borrowings totaled approximately $357.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company s short-term borrowings was constant at 3.5%.  
     
   Convertible Promissory Notes   
     
  In August 2016, we issued $200 in convertible promissory notes that are convertible into Common Stock upon our next equity securities sales to one or more investors, in a transaction or a series of related transactions, resulting in aggregate proceeds to the Company of at least $1,000. The notes bear interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of two percent (2%) per annum.  
     
   Related Party Advances   
     
  During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received unsecured, interest-free cash advances totaling $450 and $1,440, respectively, to fund operations from our Chairman. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received $100 from William Hambrecht, Director and father of our Chief Financial Officer, cash advances as part of a financing to be finalized in the next quarter.  

3. Stock Option Plans   
     
  We have two equity incentive plans, the Salon Media Group, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan and the Salon Media Group, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan,   as described in Note 7,  Employee Stock Option Plan,  of the notes to financial statements in Salon s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The Salon Media Group, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan expired on November 17, 2014 and no additional options may be issued under this Plan.  
     
  We have granted options pursuant to plans not approved (Non-plan) by shareholders. On June 9, 2016, an option to purchase 12,654,318 shares of Common Stock was granted to our Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Salon Media Group, Inc. Non Plan Stock Option agreement, with vesting in equal monthly installments over a four-year period commencing with the grant date. We did not grant any non-plan options during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

4.     Net Loss Per Share   
     
  Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents outstanding during the period, as follows:  

5.     Commitments and Contingencies   
     
      On October 17, 2012, we signed an office lease agreement to relocate our San Francisco headquarters to 870 Market Street, San Francisco, California. The five-year lease for approximately 2,405 square feet, commenced on December 1, 2012 and will terminate on November 30, 2017.  
     
  On April 16, 2014, we entered into an office lease for our new corporate offices at 132 West 31 st  Street, New York, New York consisting of 6,523 square feet in rentable space. The lease commenced on July 1, 2014 and will expire on September 30, 2019. Upon execution of the lease, a deposit with Silicon Valley Bank in the form of a letter of credit of $204 was required. The term of the lease is five years with an effective base monthly rent expense of approximately $26, and a 2014 base year to be utilized in allocating future excess direct expenses. The rent expense associated with the office lease is straight-lined over the term of the agreement. As a result, deferred rent increased to approximately $73 as of March 31, 2015 and has since decreased to approximately $65 as of September 30, 2016.

  The following summarizes our office lease commitments and short-term borrowings as of September 30, 2016:  

6. Preferred Stock    
     
  The conversion rate and common equivalent shares of our Preferred Stock as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

The Series C Preferred Stock conversion rate is subject to a downward adjustment anti-dilution provision under certain circumstances related to subsequent Salon securities issuances. The Company determined that the accounting for such conversion features does not require bifurcation under  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815) and, accordingly, the requirements of ASC 815 are not applicable.  
     
  In event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets or property of Salon to the holders of Common Stock, $1,600 per share, plus an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends, based on an annual rate of 8%. If the assets and funds available for distribution are insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock of their full preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of Salon legally available for distribution to stockholders will be distributed among the holders of Series C Preferred Stock ratably in proportion to the full preferential amounts which they are entitled to receive. As of September 30, 2016, no dividend has been declared to the holders of Preferred Stock.

SALON MEDIA GROUP, INC.   
   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)   
   (unaudited)   
     
  If, after initial preferential liquidation payments to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, any assets remain available for distribution, such assets are to be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, based on the shares of Common Stock then held by them and issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock then held by them, until aggregate distributions per share reach $2,400 for the holders of Series C Preferred Stock. Salon has currently outstanding 1,075 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.  
     
  If, after payment has been made to the holders of Common Stock and holders of Preferred Stock mentioned above, any assets remain available for distribution, such assets are to be distributed ratably among the holders of Common Stock and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, based on the number of shares of Common Stock then held by them and issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock then held by them. Based on available information, Salon estimates that the Series C Preferred Stock would account for approximately 1% of outstanding shares on an as converted basis.  
     
  The holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of Salon s Common Stock as though part of that class, and are entitled to vote on all matters and to that number of votes equal to the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock could be converted. Preferred Stockholders as a group own approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock, all with voting rights.  
     
  The aggregate liquidation preferences of all Preferred Stockholders as of September 30, 2016 were $1,720 excluding the effect of undeclared dividends, and $2,598 including the effect of undeclared dividends. We have never declared a dividend and do not expect to declare a dividend in the future.   
     
  Neither the Series C Preferred Stock nor the underlying shares of Common Stock have been registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under such act or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  

7. Subsequent Events   
    
  On October 11, 2016, we received $50 loan each from two related parties, which will be repaid during the quarter ending December 31, 2016.  
     
  On November 14, 2016, we received $300 in the form of a Demand Promissory Note.  The Note bears interest at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum and the entire principal plus any accrued interest is due upon demand by the holder.

  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other parts of this Form 10-Q should be considered in conjunction with the audited financial statements, which are included in Salon s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (the  Fiscal 2016 Annual Report ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Matters of interest therein include, but are not limited to, our disclosure of critical accounting policies.  
       
   Overview   
     
  Salon is an online news website that has driven the national discussion since 1995 through fearless journalism and commitment to making the conversation smarter.  Our award-winning content combines original investigative stories and provocative personal essays with quick-take commentary, articles, and original editorial video about politics, race, religion, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business.  
     
  We have a history of significant losses and expect to incur a loss from operations, based on generally accepted accounting principles, for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and potentially for future years. Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc., Salon s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, included a  going-concern  audit opinion on the financial statements for those years. The audit opinions report substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, citing issues such as the history of losses, liquidity issues and absence of current profitability. Our stock price and investment prospects have been and could continue to be adversely affected, thus limiting financing choices and raising concerns about the realization of value on assets and operations.  
     
  During the September 2016 quarter, we continued a shift in our strategy as led by the appointment on May 23, 2016 of Jordan Hoffner as our new Chief Executive Officer. The new strategy focuses on broadening our editorial coverage in order to attract a larger and more diversified audience, which in turn can be packaged for advertisers who increasingly are utilizing programmatic advertising to reach the audience they are targeting. Our focus on high quality editorial continued to drive a significant audience to our Website, which was boosted by the U.S. Presidential election and a strong news cycle.   However, we faced stiff competition from both new and larger websites for online advertising campaigns, while industry trends shifted toward increased use of agency and software-based approaches to buying online advertising. As a result, our direct ad sales have continued to decline and we have increasingly relied on third-party agencies to sell ads on our Website through programmatic advertising open marketplaces. The highlights of our September 2016 quarter are listed below:   

14

Highlights from Quarter ended September 30, 2016   

The September 2016 quarter was impacted by transition in both our editorial and advertising sales teams which negatively impacted our financial results. Net revenues decreased 41% to $1.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 versus $1.7 million in the same period in 2015. For the six month period ended September 30, 2016, net revenues declined 32% to $2.3 million, versus $3.4 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenue was a result of both a continued significant industry shift in online advertising from advertising sold by a direct sales team to advertising increasingly being sold through software-based  programmatic  technology and a restructuring of our editorial team that led to a short-term drop in traffic. Our direct advertising sales reduced by 62% in the quarter ended September 2016 compared to the September quarter in 2015 and programmatic advertising dropped 31% during the same period as a result of lower average traffic for the September 2016 quarter versus the same period last year. We expect the trend of decreasing direct advertising revenues to continue; however, we have made changes to our editorial team that have resulted in a rebound in traffic in October 2016 that should positively impact our programmatic revenues going forward.      

Net losses were $0.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and $1.7 million for the six month period ended September 2016, a decrease compared to $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the same periods last year. The increased losses resulted from a decrease in revenues and a corresponding lesser decrease in operating expense to $1.8 million for the September 2016 quarter, compared to $2.2 million in the same period last year, and $4.0 million for the six month period ended September 2016 compared to $4.5 million for the six month period in 2015. Operating expense included approximately $0.2 million of one-off restructuring expense during the first six months of the fiscal year. We will continue to look for ways to reduce expenses in areas that we expect can help reduce losses and accelerate a path to profitability.      

Average unique visitors to the Salon.com Website during the September 2016 quarter decreased 22% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and decreased 15% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, according to data compiled by Google Analytics. Our traffic decrease was a results of algorithm adjustments made by Facebook to promote stories from friends and family ahead of content by publishers. It was also impacted by changes we made to our editorial team that resulted in a short-term reduction in the volume of stories published daily on our Website. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our traffic has rebounded back to 12% above the average for the June 2016 quarter.      

We have continued to refine our strategy in producing Salon's editorial video content. Our first foray into video enjoyed high viral reach particularly on Facebook, but did not draw the same level of viewers on our own Website, where we have the ability to monetize it. Our new approach features a combination of long-form video interviews and commentary that we release on Facebook Live and other social media platforms, and short-cuts from these segments tailored for our website. We also have rebuilt our video efforts around a general approach that every piece of content will be adapted for use as a text article, a video, and a podcast. Our goal continues to be adding high-quality, diversified content to Salon.com, which will attract premium video advertising that commands higher cost-per-thousand-impression (CPMs) as compared to display advertising.      

The September 2016 quarter featured great journalism as Salon covered in-depth the top stories in news, politics and entertainment. Stories about politics, and specifically the 2016 Presidential Election drove the most views. Our timely coverage of the Republican and Democratic Conventions, the three Presidential candidate debates, Trump s surprise uncovered Billy Bush interview video and Clinton s continuing private e-mail FBI scrutiny has continued to energize our users. The 2016 Presidential election coverage has combined breaking news, political essays, interviews and historical context to provide intelligent and provocative coverage for our users. We have also provided broadened, thoughtful and smart coverage on parenting, religion, lifestyle, race and business that have been popular with our users.      

15

We continued to negotiate on a regular basis with the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. who serve as the collective bargaining representative of our non-supervisory editorial employees.      

Social media continues to be a significant focus across the Company; however, our traffic from this source has slowed significantly due to changes in the algorithms used by Facebook to promote publisher content. We will continue to optimize our content to be shared on social media with a special focus on our mobile platforms and continue to test ad products to monetize page views that are outside of our publishing platform. One highlight was a 28% increase in our Twitter followers compared to the June 2016 quarter. In September 2016, we surpassed 920,000   Facebook    likes  and 850,000 Twitter followers.      

Mobile users accounted for 65% of all users in September 2016, which is a steady increase from 55% in June 2015. We continue to have a company-wide focus on our users  mobile needs, especially quick and easy access to fast-loading content optimized for better readability on smaller screens. Over the past fiscal year, we have tested new mobile advertising products and upgraded the ad experience for both our users and advertising customers, with the goal to better monetize our mobile traffic.     

We continued to work toward leaner, more efficient technological systems through automation, improved architecture and adoption of emerging best practices. In the past quarter, we began implementing improvements to our ad technology platforms, our ad delivery and our ability to monetize user information while also expanding our video offerings and developing products for various emerging media platforms.      

Sources of Revenue   
     
  Most of Salon s net revenues are derived from advertising from the sale of promotional space on its Website. The sale of promotional space is generally for less than ninety days in duration. Advertisers pay for advertising based on a CPM. The primary factors in our ability to increase our advertising revenues in future periods are growth in our audience and the addition of higher CPM ad products such as pre-roll video. Attracting more unique visitors to our Website is important because these returning users generate additional page views, and each page view becomes a potential platform for advertisements. Advertising comprises banners, video, rich media and other interactive ads. CPM varies by platform and CPMs for mobile have been less than for desktop; however, in the recent quarter they have been increasing. Videos and sponsored content on mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and can demand a higher CPM. We believe that continuing to add videos and sponsored content to our mobile platform and improving and optimizing the platform s design will help increase revenues from our mobile platform.  
     
  We also generate revenue from the licensing of content that previously appeared in our Website, and from traffic referrals to third party websites.     

16

Expenses   
     
  Production and content expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our editorial and production staff, payments to freelance writers and artists, bandwidth costs associated with serving pages and     ad     serving costs.  
     
  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, bonuses and related personnel costs, travel, and other costs associated with our sales force, and business development efforts. They also include marketing promotions.  
     
  Technology expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs associated with the development, testing and enhancement of our software to manage our Website, as well as our marketing and sales efforts.  
     
  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, accounting and legal fees, rents, and other fees associated with operating a publicly traded company. Certain shared overhead expenses are allocated to other departments.  
     
  Interest expense includes accrued interest on our outstanding debt.  
     
  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718,  Stock Compensation  (ASC 718), our expenses include stock-based compensation expenses related to stock option and restricted stock grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. These costs are included in the various departmental expenses.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the financial statements in our Fiscal 2016 Annual Report. We believe accounting policies and estimates related to revenue recognition and stock-based compensation are the most critical to our financial statements. Future results may differ from current estimates if different assumptions are used or different conditions were to prevail.   
     
   Revenue Recognition   
     
  We recognize revenues once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which our obligations are fulfilled. Payments received before our obligations are fulfilled are classified as  Deferred revenues  in our balance sheet.  
     
  Advertising revenues, derived from the sale of promotional space on our Website, comprised 86% and 85% of our revenues, respectively, for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The duration of the advertisements is generally short-term, usually less than ninety days. Revenues derived from such arrangements are recognized during the period the advertising space is provided. Our obligations typically include a guaranteed minimum number of impressions. To the extent minimum guaranteed amounts are not achieved, we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed amounts are provided, if mutually agreeable to an advertiser. If these  make good  impressions are not agreeable to an advertiser, no further revenue is recognized.  
     
   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  We account for stock-based compensation under ASC 718 and recognize the fair value of stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years.   

17

We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $208,000 and $198,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had an aggregate of $2,249,000 of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $314,000 during the remainder of fiscal 2017; $628,000 during fiscal 2018; $611,000 during fiscal 2019; $574,000 during fiscal 2020 and $122,000 during fiscal 2021. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock option awards as of September 30, 2016 expected to vest. We expect to continue issuing stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.  
     
  The full impact of stock-based compensation in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of new long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, achievement of specific goals for performance-based grants, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, stock-based compensation requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards.  
     
   Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
    Net revenue    
     
  Net revenue decreased 41% to approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net revenue decreased 32% to approximately $2.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
  Advertising revenues decreased 47% to approximately $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Direct ad sales were approximately 27% and programmatic ad sales were approximately 73% of total advertising revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  Advertising revenues decreased 31% to approximately $2.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $2.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Direct ad sales were approximately 18% and programmatic ad sales were approximately 82% of total advertising revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in total advertising revenue was a result of transitions in both our editorial and advertising sales teams, lower average traffic and a continued significant industry shift by advertisers from direct sales advertising to software-based programmatic advertising.  
     
  Revenues from all other sources, mostly referral fees, decreased 23% to approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and decreased 37% to approximately $0.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The decreases were attributed to lower revenues from a renewed referral fee customer agreement.  
     
    Expenses    
     
   Production and content   
     
  Production and content expenses remained relatively flat from a year ago at approximately $0.9 million and $1.9 million for the respective three and six months ended September 30, 2016.  

18

Sales and marketing   
     
  Sales and marketing expenses decreased 50% to approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 42% to approximately $0.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases were mainly attributed to personnel changes.   
     
   Technology   
     
  Technology expenses decreased 24% to approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Technology expenses decreased 17% to approximately $0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases were mainly attributed to personnel changes.   
       
   General and administrative   
     
  General and administrative expenses decreased 4% to approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased 7% to approximately $0.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $1.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were mainly attributed to personnel changes and consulting service reductions.   
     
   Interest expense, net   
     
  Interest expense for the for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 remained flat and immaterial at $0.01 million and $0.02 million, respectively.  
     
   Liquidity and capital resources   
     
  Net cash used in operations was approximately $0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The principal uses of cash during the six months ended September 30, 2016 were to fund the $1.7 million net loss and the net activities from various working capital and immaterial non-cash items for the period. The accounts receivable, net as of September 30, 2016 of approximately $0.7 million, represent primarily advertising sales during the period, and are expected to be collected within the next four months.   
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The principal use of cash in these investing activities was to purchase office property and equipment.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $0.7 million and $1.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting mainly cash advances from related parties.   
     
  We estimate we will require approximately $0.8 million - $1.0 million in additional funding to meet our operating needs for the remaining six months ending March 31, 2017. However, we commenced collective bargaining with the WGAE and until the negotiations are finalized we will not have a clear idea of any potential increase in our budget. If planned revenues are less than expected, or if planned expenses are more than expected, the cash shortfall may be higher, which will result in a commensurate increase in required financing.  During the current and previous fiscal years, we have relied on funding from related parties. In this fiscal year through November 14, 2016, our Chairman has provided $0.35 million in cash advances.  

19

In August 2016, we issued $200 in convertible promissory notes that are convertible into Common Stock upon our next equity securities sales to one or more investors, in a transaction or a series of related transactions, resulting in aggregate proceeds to the Company of at least $1,000. The notes bear interest on the outstanding principal at the rate of two percent (2%) per annum.  
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, William Hambrecht, Director and father of our Chief Financial Officer provided $0.10 million in advance as part of a financing to be finalized in the next quarter. If we were not able to obtain additional funding from related parties or others, we would be required to curtail or discontinue operations, or consider other alternatives.  
     
   Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
     
  The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:  

20

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
     
  We maintain all of our cash in immediately available cash deposits at its bank. These funds are not subject to market risk and no interest is paid on such funds. In May 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. that allows us to borrow up to $1.0 million at a rate of prime less 0.25% which subjects us to interest rate risk. In September 2016, this credit agreement was sold to Raymond James. We feel that the risk of a rate change is not material as we contemplate having a maximum of only $1.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding during our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.0 million plus accrued interest outstanding under this agreement, payable on demand. As we conduct all of our business in the United States, we are not subject to foreign exchange risk.  
       
   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
     
   Evaluation of Our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls   
     
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly Form 10-Q report (September 30, 2016), as is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as the principal executive and financial officers, respectively, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   
     
  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly Form 10-Q report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
     
  Our management has concluded that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  
     
  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.  
     
   Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   
     
  There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  

21

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
     
  Not applicable.  
     
   Item 1A. Risk F  actors.   
       
   Salon s business faces significant risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks Salon faces. Additional risks that are not yet known or that are currently immaterial may also impair its business operations or have a negative impact on its stock price. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, its business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of its Common Stock could decline.     The Risk Factors set forth below have not materially changed from those included in our   Fiscal 2016 Annual Report.   
         
   Salon has historically lacked significant revenues and has a history of losses    
     
  We have a history of significant losses and expect to incur a loss from operations, based on generally accepted accounting principles, for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 and to be determined in future years. Even if we attain profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate, or continue to decline as we saw in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, or operating expenses exceed expectations, financial results will most likely be severely harmed and our ability to continue operations will be seriously jeopardized.   
     
  Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc., Salon s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012 through 2016 included a  going-concern  audit opinion on the financial statements for each of those years. The audit opinions report substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, citing issues such as the history of losses and absence of current profitability. As a result of the  going-concern  opinions, our stock price and investment prospects have been and will continue to be adversely affected, thus limiting financing choices and raising concerns about the realization of value on assets and operations.  
     
  The Company has operated principally with the assistance of interest free advances from related parties. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
   Salon s projected cash flows may not meet expectations   
     
  We rely on cash projections to run our business and change such projections as new information is made available or events occur. The most significant component of our cash projections is cash to be generated from advertising sales. Forecasting advertising revenues and resulting cash receipts for an extended period of time is problematic due to the short duration of most advertising sales contracts. If projected cash inflows and outflows do not meet expectations, our ability to continue as a going concern may be adversely affected.  
     
  If we forecast or experience periods of limited, or diminishing cash resources, we may need to sell additional securities or borrow additional funds. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue additional securities in future periods or borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms to meet our cash needs. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected if we are unable to raise additional cash from sources we have relied upon in the past or new sources.      

22

We have relied on related parties for significant investment capital   
    
  We have relied on cash infusions from related parties to fund operations for many years. The related parties are primarily John Warnock, Chairman of the Board of Salon, and, to a lesser extent in recent years, William Hambrecht. William Hambrecht is a Director and the father of our former CEO and current Chief Financial Officer, Elizabeth Hambrecht. During the current fiscal year, through November 14, 2016, Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht have contributed $0.35 million and $0.10 million, respectively, in cash advances to fund our operations.   
       
  Curtailment of cash investments and borrowing guarantees by related parties would detrimentally impact our cash availability and our ability to fund our operations.  
     
    We started collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees,   and the results of this process are uncertain   
     
  On August 3, 2015, WGAE became the collective bargaining representative of Salon s non-supervisory editorial employees. We commenced collective bargaining with WGAE in November 2015. Should this collective bargaining process result in an agreement that would not permit us to obtain additional funding, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our current business.  
     
   Our principal stockholders exercise a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which non-principal stockholders disagree, which may affect the value of non-principal stockholders  investments   
     
  Approximately 45% of our voting securities are controlled, directly or indirectly by our Chairman, John Warnock, and approximately 36% is controlled, directly or indirectly, by William Hambrecht, a Director and the father of our Chief Financial Officer. We remain dependent upon Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht for continued financial support while we seek external financing from potential investors in the form of additional indebtedness or through the sale of equity securities in a private placement. While all outstanding, unsecured, interest-free cash advances from Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht at February 28, 2013 were exchanged for Common Stock in the Company s Recapitalization (described in Note 4 to the financial statements included in the 2016 Annual Report), Mr. Warnock has continued to make unsecured, interest-free, cash advances to cover our operating expenses. These advances are payable on demand, and are exchangeable into securities on the same terms as those to be issued in our next financing from non-related parties. We were advised by Mr. Warnock and Mr. Hambrecht that they executed a stock transaction that has the effect of equalizing their stock ownership. The corresponding Forms 4 and Form 8-K were filed with the SEC on November 24 and November 25, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Future sales of significant number of shares of our Common Stock by principal stockholders could cause our stock price to decline    
       
  Our directors and officers own approximately 64 million shares, or 83% in the aggregate, of our Common Stock. As our Common Stock is normally thinly traded, if our principal stockholders were to sell their shares of Common Stock, the per share price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected.   
     
   Our stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our control and which may prevent our stockholders from reselling Common Stock at a profit   
       
  The securities markets can experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, our stock is thinly traded. Even a few transactions, whether in response to disappointment in our expected operating results or any other reason, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decrease significantly.  

23

Holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to potentially significant liquidation preferences of Salon s assets over holders of our Common Stock in the event of a liquidation event   
     
  Holders of our Series C Preferred Stock ( Preferred Stock ) have liquidation preferences over holders of Common Stock of the first approximately $2.6 million in potential sales proceeds as of September 30, 2016, which includes the effect of undeclared dividends, if granted, of about $0.9 million. If a liquidation event were to occur, and Preferred Stock dividends were declared, the holders of Preferred Stock would be entitled to the first $2.6 million of cash distributions. If a liquidation event were to occur in excess of $2.6 million and if Preferred Stock dividends were to be declared, the holders of Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive a relatively larger distribution than the holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive.  
     
   We depend on advertising sales for substantially all of our revenues, and our inability to maintain or increase advertising revenues would harm our busin  ess   
     
  Our ability to maintain or increase our advertising revenues depends upon many factors, including whether we will be able to:  

attract and maintain additional visitors to our Website and increase brand awareness;     

sell and market our Website or other rich media advertisements;     

maintain a significant number of sellable impressions generated from Website visitors available to advertisers;     

increase the dollar amount of our advertising orders;     

improve our Website s technology for serving advertising;     

handle temporary high volume traffic spikes to our Website;     

measure accurately the number and demographic characteristics of our users; and     

attract and retain key sales personnel.     
     
   As more of our users access our Website using mobile devices rather than PCs, if we do not continue to grow our mobile users and revenue, our business will be adversely impacted.   
     
  Internet users increasingly use mobile devices rather than PCs to access the Internet.  Over 50% of our monthly users are now visiting our Website on mobile devices.  As mobile platforms encompass a larger share of our readers, our ability to grow advertising revenue is increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices.  While we plan to continue to devote technology resources to support our mobile browser product, apps and advertising products, if our mobile browser product, apps, and advertising products for mobile devices do not attract and retain users and advertisers to generate mobile revenue, our operating and financial results will be adversely impacted. We are dependent upon our products operating on mobile operating systems we do not control. The mobile phone manufacturer and its operating systems might block access to our Website or make it hard for users to find our Website through their devices, or block certain ads or charge us for delivery of ads, all of which would harm our operations and suppress revenue potential.   

24

Technologies and software applications could block our advertisements, which could harm our operating results.   
     
  Technologies and software applications have been developed for PC and mobile devices that can block or allow users to opt out of display advertising, delete or block cookies used to deliver advertising, or move advertising to less optimal placements to suppress view-ability. Most of our advertising revenue is derived from display or video advertisements on our Website. As a result, ad-blocking technologies or software could reduce the number of display or video advertisements.  
     
   If we cannot increase referrals from social media platforms, our ability to attract new unique visitors and maintain the engagement of existing unique visitors could be adversely affected.   
     
  As the behavior of internet consumers continues to change, distribution of our content, products and services via traditional methods may become less effective, and new distribution strategies may need to be developed. Consumers are increasingly using social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to communicate and to acquire and disseminate information. As consumers migrate towards social networks, we continue to build social elements into our content, products and services in order to make them available on social networks and to attract and engage consumers on our Website and mobile platforms. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate our content with such social networking or other new consumer trends. Even if we are able to distribute our content, products and services effectively through social networking or other new or developing distribution channels, this does not assure that we will be able to attract new unique visitors.  
     
   Hackers may attempt to penetrate our security system and online security breaches could harm our business   
     
  Consumer and supplier confidence in our Website depends on maintaining strong security features. Experienced programmers or  hackers  have penetrated sectors of our systems, and we expect that these attempts will continue to occur from time to time. To our knowledge, there has been no outward harm to us or our readers as a result of hacking attempts. Furthermore, Salon has engaged the services of a third-party web application security-testing company, which conducts regular comprehensive searches for any vulnerabilities that may exist, allowing us to address and fix any issues before they can be exploited. This minimizes the risk of damage; however, because a hacker who is able to penetrate network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our products and services, we may have to expend significant capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate problems caused by hackers. Additionally, we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security. Such security breaches could materially affect our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation. In addition, the transmission of computer viruses resulting from hackers or otherwise could expose us to significant liability. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we have relationships.  
       
   We must promote the Salon brand to attract and retain users, advertisers and strategic partners   
       
  The success of the Salon brand depends largely on our ability to provide high quality content and services. If Internet users do not perceive our existing content and services to be of high quality, or if we introduce new content and services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably perceived by users, we may not be successful in promoting and maintaining the Salon brand. Any change in the focus of our operations creates a risk of diluting our brand, confusing consumers and decreasing the value of our user base to advertisers. If we are unable to maintain or grow the Salon brand, our business would be severely harmed.  

25

We must hire, integrate and/or retain qualified personnel to support our business plans   
     
  Our success significantly depends on key personnel. In addition, because our users must perceive the content of our Website as having been created by credible and notable sources, our success also depends on the name recognition and reputation of our editorial staff. Due to our history of losses, we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We may be unable to retain our current key employees or attract, integrate or retain other qualified employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel, our business would be harmed.  
     
   Our success depends on our key p  ersonnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, could disrupt our business   
     
  Our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key sales, marketing and operations personnel. While we have employment agreements with some key management, these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify, hire and integrate new personnel. We do not have key person insurance policies in place for these employees.   
     
   We may expend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend claims of infringement by third parties, and if we are not successful w  e may lose rights to use significant material or be required to pay significant fees   
     
  Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our proprietary content. We rely exclusively on copyright law to protect our content. While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, these steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our content, which could severely harm our business. We also license content from various freelance providers and other third-party content providers. While we attempt to ensure that such content may be freely licensed to us, other parties may assert claims of infringement against us relating to such content.  
     
  We may need to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market and deliver new services. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or rights granted pursuant to any licenses may not be valid and enforceable.  
     
  In April 1999, we acquired the Internet address www.salon.com. Because www.salon.com is the address of the main home page to our Website and incorporates Salon s name, it is a vital part of our intellectual property assets. We do not have a registered trademark on the address, and therefore it may be difficult for us to prevent a third party from infringing on our intellectual property rights to the address. If we fail to adequately protect our rights to the Website address, or if a third party infringes our rights to the address, or otherwise dilutes the value of www.salon.com, our business could be harmed.  
       
   Our technology development efforts may not be successful in improving the functionality of our network, which could result in reduced traffic on our Website or reduced advertising revenues   
     
  We are constantly upgrading our technology to manage our Website. During the last year we redesigned our Website homepage and vertical sections. In addition, we are creating new technology for new products that we expect to launch on an ongoing basis. If these systems do not work as intended, or if we are unable to continue to develop these systems to keep up with the rapid evolution of technology for content delivery, our Website may not operate properly, which could harm our business. Additionally, software product design, development and enhancement involve creativity, expense and the use of new development tools and learning processes. Delays in software development processes are common, as are project failures, and either factor could harm our business. Moreover, complex software products such as our online publishing frequently contain undetected errors or shortcomings, and may fail to perform or scale as expected. Although we have tested and will continue to test our systems, errors or deficiencies may be found in these systems that could adversely impact our business.  

26

We rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising and services to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could adversely affect our business   
       
  We rely on third parties to provide the technologies that we use to deliver content, advertising, and services to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business models in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of the technologies to deliver our content, advertising, and services. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those technologies, and any change in licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could adversely affect our business.  
     
   We may be held liable for content or third party links on our Website or content distributed to third parties   
     
  As a publisher and distributor of content over the Internet, including links to third-party websites that may be accessible through our Website, or content that includes links or references to a third-party s website, we face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature, content or ownership of the material that is published on or distributed from our Website. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, websites and print publications in the past. Other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided on linked websites, including information deemed to constitute professional advice such as legal, medical, financial or investment advice. Other claims may be based on links to sexually explicit websites. Although we carry general liability and media insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our financial condition and business. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure to these forms of liability may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users.  
       
   Our systems may fail due to natural disasters, telecommunications failures and other events, any of which would limit user traffic   
     
  Our Website  Salon.com , and content management system run on cloud computing hosted by Amazon Web Services, which are in a facility in Herndon, Virginia. Any disruption of Amazon s cloud computing platform could result in a service outage. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, supplier failure to meet commitments, and similar events could damage these systems and cause interruptions in our services. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could cause users to stop visiting our Website and could cause advertisers to terminate any agreements with us. In addition, we could lose advertising revenues during these interruptions and user satisfaction could be negatively impacted if the service is slow or unavailable. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan.  
     
  Our Website must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. It is possible that we will experience systems failures in the future and that such failures could harm our business. In addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to our Website. Many of these providers and operators have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any of these system failures could harm our business.  

27

Privacy concerns could impair our business   
     
  We have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our Website and services without the user s permission. In the past, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy. If we use personal information without permission or in violation of our policy, we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify Internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Union, have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements. The United States may adopt similar legislation or regulatory requirements in the future. If consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.  
     
   Due to the volatility of the price of our Common Stock, we may be the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend   
     
  The price of our Common Stock has experienced volatility in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. In the past, following volatility in the price of a company s securities, securities holders have instituted class action litigation against such company. Many companies have been subjected to this type of litigation. If the market value of our Common Stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the merits or outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management s attention could be diverted, causing our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer. To date, we have not been subject to such litigation.  
     
   Our quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock   
     
  Our future revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and any of which could severely harm our business. These factors include:  

Our ability to attract and retain advertisers;     

Our ability to attract and retain a large number of users;     

Our ability to increase referrals from our social media presence;     

The introduction of new websites, services or products by us or by our competitors;     

Our ability to maximize our mobile presence;     

The timing and uncertainty of our advertising sales cycles;     

The mix of advertisements sold by us or our competitors;     

Economic and business cycles;     

Our ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel;     

Technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet generally or the operation of our Website; and      

The amount and timing of operating costs.     

28

Due to the factors noted above and the other risks discussed in this section and in our Annual Report, one should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. If future periods  results of operations are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our Common Stock could decline.   
     
   Provisions in Delaware law and our charter, stock option agreements and offer letters to executive officers may prevent or delay a change of control   
     
  We are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger or sale of more than 10% of its assets with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation s assets unless:  

the board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation s assets;     

after the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation s assets, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, excluding shares owned by directors, officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or      

on or after such date, the merger or sale is approved by the board of directors and the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the stockholder.     
     
  A Delaware corporation may opt out of the Delaware anti-takeover laws if its certificate of incorporation or bylaws so provide. We have not opted out of the provisions of the anti-takeover laws. As such, these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or changes of control of Salon and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us.  
     
  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a provision relating to special meetings of our shareholders that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption) or by the holders of not less than 10% of all of the shares entitled to cast votes at the meeting. This provision may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.  
     
  In addition, employment agreements with certain executive officers provide for the payment of severance and acceleration of the vesting of options and restricted stock in the event of termination of the executive officer following a change of control of Salon. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts.
