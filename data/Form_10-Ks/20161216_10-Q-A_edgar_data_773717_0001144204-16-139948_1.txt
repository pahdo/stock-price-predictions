SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Form 10-Q contains certain statements
which are forward-looking in nature and are based on the current beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information
currently available to management, including statements related to the uncertainty of the quantity or quality of minerals in our
tailings, the fluctuations in the market price of such reserves, general trends in our operations or financial results, plans,
expectations, estimates and beliefs. In addition, when used in this Form 10-Q, the words  may,   could, 
 should,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   intend, 
 plan,   predict  and similar expressions and their variants, as they relate to us or our management, may

events, the outcome of which is subject to risks. We have attempted to identify, in context, certain of the factors that we believe
may cause actual future experience and results to differ materially from our current expectations, which may have a significant
impact on our business, operating results, financial condition or your investment in our common stock, as described in Part II,
Item 1A entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking
statements are inherently uncertain. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions
prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein. 

We undertake no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, your
attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K.

NOTE 1 - OVERVIEW   

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. ( we, 
 us,   our,   Standard Metals,  the  Company  or the  Corporation )
(a.k.a. Cambrian Minerals Group, Inc.) is an exploration stage company having offices in Gadsden, Alabama and through its subsidiary,
a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our business plan is to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah property to serve
as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility (which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallugircal plant, and hydrometallurgical
recovery plant). 

The Company plans to perform permitted
custom processing toll milling which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the
extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling
and refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction
of precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk
materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies, which lack the
expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production. 

We are required to obtain several permits
before we can begin construction of a small scale mineral processing facility to conduct permitted processing toll milling activities
and construction of the required additional buildings and well relocation necessary for us to commence operations. 

Any reference herein to  Standard
Metals,   the Company,   we,   our,  or  us  is intended to mean Standard
Metals Processing, Inc. a Nevada corporation, and all of our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. 

Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, assuming
we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred losses from operations of $657,666. At September
30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $102,294,846 and a working capital deficit of $9,123,197. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
on our ability to raise the required additional capital or debt financing to meet short and long-term operating requirements. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received net cash proceeds of $220,000 from the convertible promissory notes
payable. Management believes that private placements of equity capital and/or additional debt financing will be needed to fund
our long-term operating requirements. The Company may also encounter business endeavors that require significant cash commitments
or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash. If the Company raises additional
funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders could
be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may
not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms,
the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and
materially restrict our operations. We are continuing to pursue external financing alternatives to improve our working capital
position. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Principles of Consolidation  

The financial statements include the accounts
of Standard Metals Processing, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. ( TMMG ), and
TMMG s wholly owned subsidiaries Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc. and Tonopah Resources, Inc. All significant intercompany
transactions, accounts and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US
GAAP ), for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete
financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed May 2, 2016. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments unless otherwise indicated) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year as a whole. 

7   

Shea Mining and Milling Assets  

The Company recorded the estimated fair
value of the Shea Mining and Milling assets as an aggregate amount on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The assets include
the mine tailings and dumps, the land, water rights and the milling facility (the buildings and equipment). None of the assets
have been put into production, nor has the Company performed any repair or updates to any of the equipment or buildings. As such,
the Company will continue to classify them under a single listing. 

Mineral Properties  

Mineral property acquisition costs are
recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined. No properties have produced operating revenues
at this time. Exploration, mineral property evaluation, option payments, related acquisition costs for mineral properties acquired
under an option agreement, general overhead, administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance
basis are expensed in the period they are incurred. When reserves are determined for a property and a bankable feasibility study
is completed, subsequent exploration and development costs on the property would be capitalized. If a project were to be put into
production, capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis. 

Management reviews the net carrying value
of each mineral property as changes may materialize with a property or at a minimum, on an annual basis. Where information and
conditions suggest impairment, estimated future net cash flows from each property are calculated using estimated future prices,
proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, and operating, capital and reclamation costs on an
undiscounted basis. If it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, a write-down to the estimated
fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period. Where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other
conditions suggest impairment, management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered. 

Management s estimates of gold prices,
recoverable reserves, probable outcomes, operating capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
affect the recoverability of mineral property costs. 

The Company does not own any mining claims.
It owns tailings located on the Tonopah property and some tailings located in Manhattan, Nevada. The Company has not disturbed
or processed any of this material and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets   

The Company will periodically evaluate
the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including but not limited to, mineral properties, mine tailings, mine
dumps, capital assets and intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review and at least annually. The carrying
value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable
and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that
fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

During the period ended September 30, 2016
and through December 7, 2016, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company.  Management does not believe the
adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

NOTE 3  SHEA MILLING AND MINING
ASSETS   

On March 15, 2011, the Company entered
into an exchange agreement by and between the Company, Shea Mining, Afignis, LLC, Leslie Lucas Partners, LLC, Wits Basin and Alfred
A. Rapetti (the  Shea Exchange Agreement ) whereby the Company acquired certain assets from Shea Mining, which assets
include those located in Tonopah financed through a note payable assigned to the Company, mine dumps, a property lease and a contract
agreement in exchange for 35,000,000 shares of our unregistered shares. The Shea Exchange Agreement did not include any operable
toll milling equipment, employees or operational processes and therefore has been accounted for as a purchase of a group of assets.
The Company completed the Shea Exchange Agreement to acquire the Shea assets and develop a toll milling services business of precious
minerals. 

8   

Pursuant to the assignment of a note payable,
the Company executed an Assignment and Assumption of Loan Documents and Loan Modification Agreement, by and between us, Shea Mining
and NJB Mining, Inc. (the  Loan Modification Agreement ), dated March 15, 2011, for those assets located in Tonopah,
Nevada ( Tonopah ), consisting of land, buildings, mining tailings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment
and water permits. The land encompasses 1,186 deeded acres, one of the largest private land holdings in Esmeralda County, Nevada.
An estimated 2,200,000 tons of tailings known as the Millers Tailings from the historic gold rush of Goldfield and Tonopah, Nevada
sits on approximately 334 acres of this land. The Company has not processed any of these tailings and has no intention to do so
in the near future. 

The Tonopah property was subject to an
existing $2,500,000 first deed of trust, which was in default at the time of the Shea Exchange Agreement and included accrued interest
of $375,645, which was also assumed in the transaction. As part of the assignment, NJB Mining, Inc. ( NJB ) modified
the related note to allow the Company until May 14, 2011 to refinance this mortgage, which was subsequently extended numerous times.
As of August 31, 2011, the Company was still in default under the terms of the Loan Modification Agreement, and therefore entered
into a forbearance agreement with NJB, (the  NJB Forbearance Agreement ), in which NJB agreed to forbear from initiating
legal proceedings, including forbearance of the deed of trust and enforcement of its collection remedies. The NJB Forbearance Agreement
further provided for additional extensions up through December 9, 2011. On December 9, 2011, Pure Path Capital Management Company,
LLC ( Pure Path ) purchased the Loan Modification Agreement and the NJB Forbearance Agreement directly from NJB. On
December 21, 2011, we entered into an amended and restated forbearance agreement with Pure Path (the  A R Forbearance ),
whereby Pure Path extended the provisions of the NJB Forbearance Agreement. Pure Path provided an additional extension to stay
any action of the A R Forbearance until June 8, 2012, on which date, if not paid or another agreement was not executed, the
Company would be required to issue 5,000,000 shares of its common stock to Pure Path; such extension was provided without additional
consideration. The Company did not pay the balance of the mortgage on June 8, 2012 and pursuant to the terms of the A R Forbearance
Agreement, the Company was required to issue 5,000,000 shares to Pure Path. The 5,000,000 shares were approved for issuance by
the Board of Directors on October 9, 2012 and were issued to Pure Path on December 6, 2012. Pure Path provided additional extensions
to stay any action of the Forbearance Agreement until August 31, 2013; such extensions were provided without additional consideration.
On October 10, 2013, the Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Pure Path.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Pure Path relinquished the rights and obligations owed to it and agreed to forbear collection remedies
and legal proceedings against the Company including foreclosure on the Deed of Trust. In connection with the settlement and release
of various debts of approximately $1,500,000, consulting fees owed by the Company, and relinquishment of rights by Pure Path, the
Company issued 27,000,000 restricted shares and a convertible promissory note for up to $2,500,000 with a principal amount on the
date of issuance of $1,933,345 bearing interest of 8% per year for the amounts owed under the Pure Path Agreements. 

In connection with the Shea Exchange Agreement,
the Company was also assigned the ownership of approximately a six square mile section of mine dump material in Manhattan, Nevada
( Manhattan ). The Company has not disturbed, moved or processed any of this material and currently has no intention
to do so. 

The other assets the Company acquired consisted
of a property lease, which allowed the use of an assay lab property and the associated water permits, (with a right to purchase
for $6,000,000) and a contract agreement, which allowed the Company use of processing permits, located in Amargosa Valley, Nevada
( Amargosa ). The Company paid a monthly base rent of $17,500 on this lease and $5,000 monthly on the contract agreement.
In January 2012, the landlord of the Amargosa lease caused to have served a five Day Notice To Pay Rent Or Quit due to default
in the monthly $17,500 lease payments. The Company began immediate communications with the landlord, which resulted in a delay
of further actions by the landlord to pursue any remedies. Then on February 9, 2012, the landlord caused to have served an Order
For Summary Eviction ( Eviction ) due to continued default in lease payments. Effective with the Eviction, a total
of $112,500 in lease and contract payments remain unpaid as well as $10,500 in late fees required pursuant to the terms of the
lease. On February 10, 2012, the Beatty County Sheriff completed the Eviction at Amargosa and the Company as such, no longer has
access to the assay lab or permits at Amargosa. As a result, all remaining equipment at Amargosa with an aggregate value of $40,925
was written off as impaired. 

Pursuant to the Shea Exchange Agreement,
the Company issued a total of 35,000,000 shares of our common stock to the equity holders of Shea Mining in exchange for certain
of their assets, resulting in those holders owning an ownership interest of approximately 87% of our then currently outstanding
common stock (approximately 56% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis). Alfred A. Rapetti, then a member of our Board of
Directors and our former Chief Executive Officer, was granted an irrevocable voting proxy for half of the shares issued to the
Shea Mining equity holders, which continues until the affected shares are publicly sold after a period of at least nine months,
and thereafter in accordance with all applicable securities laws. In August 2011, these rights were transferred to Blair Mielke,
a former director of the Company. All such voting rights have since been canceled by the owners or through a transfer of ownership.
The Company also agreed to indemnify Shea Mining from any liabilities arising after March 15, 2011 out of the Loan Modification
Agreement or the loan agreements. 

9   

The purchase consideration of the assets
acquired was calculated as follows: 

In conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, cost of acquiring a group of assets is allocated to the individual assets within
the group based on the relative fair values of the individual assets. 

The table below sets forth the final purchase
price allocation. The fair value of the mineral properties and property and equipment was determined based on level 3 inputs using
cost and market value approaches. 

Simultaneous with these transactions, pursuant
to the Shea Exchange Agreement, Wits Basin exchanged 19,713,544 shares of the Company s common stock it held for 10,000,000
shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $10,000,000, payable only
upon certain liquidity or triggering events. Additional details regarding the Series A Preferred Stock can be found below in  Shareholders
Equity . Additionally, the Company obtained the right to transfer the entire interest and related debt of the Bates-Hunter
Mine, at any time prior to June 13, 2011, to Wits Basin in exchange for the cancellation of a promissory note issued by Hunter
Bates payable in favor of Wits Basin in the approximate amount of $2,500,000. On April 29, 2011, our Board of Directors approved
this transfer. 

Management analyzed the Shea Mining and
Milling assets and determined that the Tonopah mine tailings of $24,888,252, Tonopah dormant milling facility of $8,062,875 and
Manhattan mine dumps of $100,000 were fully impaired and recorded an impairment of $33,051,127 and reduced the net carrying value
of the Miller s Landing assets to $2,108,300. 

The Company does not conduct any mining
activity. 

NOTE 4   ASSET HELD FOR SALE   

During the year ended December 31, 2015
the Company determined that certain equipment with a historic cost of $2,020,415 had a fair value of $996,643 and was no longer
required. The Company evaluated this event using the guidance provided by ASC 360-10    Property, Plant and Equipment  
Impairment or disposal of long-life assets    and concluded an impairment of machinery and equipment of $1,023,772 was
required. The Company negotiated with the Vendor that originally sold the equipment to the Company to accept such certain equipment
held for sale in full settlement of the Vendor s Long-Term Trade Payable. On February 23, 2016 an auction was held in which
$222,597 of other equipment was sold for $56,500. The net proceeds from this sale of $37,821 were paid to a former employee for
past compensation. The Company is negotiating the sale of additional equipment with a fair value of $12,000. 

NOTE 5   PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT   

The Company is preparing the Tonopah property
site for the construction of a permitted custom processing toll milling facility including grading the land, installing fencing
and working with contractors for our 21,875 square foot building and servicing and drilling various wells for our future operations. 

Components of our property, plant and equipment
are as follows:

2016 the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes totaling $160,000. The Convertible promissory notes accrue interest at 8%
and mature 2 years from the date of issue. At the option of the holder the Convertible Promissory Notes convert into shares of
the Company s Common Stock. The $55,000 convertible promissory note is convertible at $0.021 per share based on the ninety
day VWAP ending on the date of funding, the $30,000 convertible promissory note is convertible at $0.05 per share based on the
ninety day VWAP ending on the date of funding, and the $75,000 convertible promissory note is convertible at $0.05 per share based
on a fifty percent discount to the closing sale price on the last trading day immediately preceding the issue date. The Company
then analyzed the conversion under ASC 470-20  Debt with conversion and other options  for consideration of a conversion feature.
The Company recorded a discount for the intrinsic value of the conversion feature of $160,000 and will amortize this debt discount
over the term of the notes.

accrues interest at 8% per annum and is convertible into shares of common stock at a price of $0.06 per share. The Company then
analyzed the conversion under ASC 470-20  Debt with conversion and other options  for consideration of a conversion feature.
The Company recorded a discount for the intrinsic value of the conversion feature of $60,000 and will amortize this debt discount

On February 11, 2015, the Company issued
an unsecured promissory note to Tina Gregerson Family Properties, LLC, an entity controlled by a officer and director of the Company.
The Note for up to $750,000 will be provided in tranches. Maturity of each tranche is one year from the date of receipt. Interest
will accrue at 8% per annum on each tranche. As consideration, the Company agreed to issue common stock purchase warrants for the
purchase of up to 250,000 shares of common stock exercisable for seven years at $1.23 per share. The Company then analyzed the
warrant under ASC 470-20-25  Debt with conversion and other options  for consideration of a warrants issue. The Company recorded
a discount from the relative fair value of the warrants of $116,560. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions: stock price on the measurement date of $1.25; warrant term of 7 years; expected volatility
of 75%; and discount rate of 1.83% and accounted for them as debt discount, which will be amortized over the term of the loan.

Series A Preferred Stock    

Simultaneous with the Shea Exchange Agreement,
Wits Basin exchanged 19,713,544 shares of our common stock it held for 10,000,000 shares ($.001 par value each) of  Series
A Preferred Stock  with an original issue price of $1.00 per share.  

11   

The Company entered
into an Agreement on July 29, 2016 with the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, Wits Basin Precious Minerals, Inc., ( Wits )
and Wits  secured creditor regarding exchange options for the Series A Preferred Stock. Under the terms of the Agreement,
upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event (as defined below), the holders of the Preferred Stock will receive the corresponding
compensation, the  Triggering Events  and their corresponding compensation are set forth below: 

Liquidation Rights, Stated Value and
Redemption  . The Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (referred to herein as  Stated
Value ), payable only upon certain events. 

(a) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, and after paying or adequately providing for the payment of all its obligations, the remainder of
the assets of the Corporation shall be distributed, either in cash or in kind, first pro rata to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock in an amount equal to the Stated Value (as described below); then, to any other series of Preferred Stock, until an amount
to be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors prior to issuances of such Preferred Stock, has been distributed per
share, and, then, the remainder pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock. 

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Triggering
Event (as defined below), the holders of the Preferred Stock will receive the corresponding compensation, The  Triggering
Events  and their corresponding compensation are set forth below: 

(1) If either
of the following occur:  

 (i) the Corporation
receives proceeds of $10,000,000 or more in a cash offering; OR  

 (ii) the Corporation s
Common Stock trades at $3.00 or more (with proportionate adjustments for stock splits) for 90 consecutive trading days;  

 then all of the
10,000,000 shares of the Preferred Stock will be exchanged for 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock. 

(2) If the Corporation
has an average market capitalization (calculated by adding the value of all outstanding shares of Common Stock valued at the Corporation s
closing sale price on the Over the Counter Markets (or other applicable exchange) (the  Market ) of $200,000,000 or
more over any consecutive 95 day period following the effective date of this agreement and the effective date of any required duly
authorized amendment to the Standard s Articles of Incorporation, the terms of the Preferred Stock and the subsequent consent
of the holder s secured creditor to the final form and terms of such amendment, and items (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of Section (b)
have not been met, then the Corporation has the right to:  

 (A) issue the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Stated Value using the average closing sale price of the Common Stock on the Over
the Counter Markets of the prior 15 trading days from the date of the notice. The Corporation will provide 10 days  prior
written notice to the holder and any known secured party of such holder of the Series A Stock of its intention to proceed with
this option; or 

 (B) issue a portion
of the Stated Value in shares of Common Stock based on the valuation formula in 3(b)(2)(A) and pay the remaining Stated Value in
cash.  

 If this Section
(3)(b)(2) is triggered, the Corporation has three years to choose option Section (3)(b)(2)(A) or (B) and pay the Stated Value.
The Corporation has 60 days from the date of notice of its election to pay under either Section (3)(b)(2)(A) or (B). 

Upon payment of
the Stated Value, the Series A Shares will be retired. 

(c) If Section
(3)(b)(2) is triggered and the Corporation fails to pay the Stated Value within the three year time frame, the Corporation will
take all necessary action to return the Series A Preferred Shares in their original form (containing all original terms and conditions)
to the holder with the exception that the Stated Value will be increased to $10,100,000 upon delivery and the Corporation will
lose the exchange options provided in Section (3)(b). 

The previous terms
of the Series A Preferred Stock would have required the Company to make a payment of $10,000,000 upon the Company having an average
market capitalization of $200,000,000. This Agreement gives the Company additional payment options and allows for the payment to
be made completely or partially in common shares, depending on the Triggering Event. 

The Company issued
five million shares of restricted common stock that are being held in escrow pending a Series A Preferred Stock Triggering Event. 

The Company analyzed the event under ASC
470-20  Debt with conversion and other options  for consideration of a common stock. The Company believe that common stock
in escrow should not be recognized in the financial statements as Wits does not have control or rights to the common shares held
in escrow until the Triggering Event. 

Series B Preferred Stock  

There are no shares of Series B Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding. The class of stock has been retired. 

  On April 11, 2016 the Company and Pure Path Capital Management
LLC, a related party, executed an addendum removing Pure Path s ability to convert its note into shares of Series B Preferred
Stock. Subsequently, the Company retired and cancelled the entire class of Series B Preferred Stock, which was never issued or
outstanding and such class is no longer available for issuance. 

Common Stock  

On July 22, 2016 three convertible promissory
notes payable totaling $160,000 and accrued interest of $4,919 were converted into 4,879,067 shares of restricted common stock.

Common Stock Subscribed  

On August 17, 2016 the company received
a subscription agreement and $20,000 for 275,028 shares of the Company common stock, as of September 30, 2016 the shares were not
issued. The shares were issued on December 13, 2016. 

Option Grants  

2010 Plan  

The Company had one stock option plan:
the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the  2010 Plan ). Stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
and other stock and cash awards may be granted under the Plan. In general, options vest over a period ranging from immediate vesting
to five years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Effective January 21, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors (the
 Board ) authorized an amendment to the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, to increase the number of options available for
granting under the 2010 Plan from 3,000,000 to 13,500,000 and authorized the Company to file an S-8 Registration Statement with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (subsequently filed on January 27, 2011) for the registration of the shares available
in the Plan. On March 15, 2011, with the closing of the Shea Exchange Agreement a  change of control  event was deemed
to have occurred and 13,500,000 previously granted stock options vested in full. Effective July 25, 2011, the 2010 Plan was amended
to increase the total shares of stock which may be issued under the 2010 Plan from 13,500,000 to 14,500,000. 

The Company has been receiving files from
former officers and attorneys. Upon review of the files, the original 2010 Plan and Board Resolution were located. The 2010 Plan
approved by the Board of Directors on March 22, 2010 authorized 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2010 Plan.
The Board of Directors voted to increase the number of shares available under the 2010 Plan on January 21, 2011. Section 9.11 of
the 2010 Plan as approved by the Board states: 

9.11 Amendment of the Plan. The Board
of Directors may amend or discontinue the Plan at any time. However, no such amendment or discontinuance shall adversely change
or impair, without the consent of the recipient, an Incentive previously granted. Further, no such amendment shall, without approval
of the stockholders of the Company, (a) increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued to all participants
under the Plan, (b) change or expand the types of Incentives that may be granted under the Plan, (c) change the class of persons
eligible to receive Incentives under the Plan, or (d) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan.  

Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Plan,
the stockholders of the Company must approve this increase. As the stockholders of the Company did not approve the increase of
shares available under the 2010 Plan, the increase on January 21, 2011 was not effective. 

As of January 21, 2011 the Company had
issued a total of 2,800,000 options to purchase shares under the 2010 Plan and had 200,000 shares remaining authorized and unissued.
However, also on January 21, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 10,500,000 options. This issuance far exceeded
the number of shares available and the excess issuances were not valid. As a correction measure, the Company has divided the 200,000
shares that were available pro-rata between the persons named in the resolution. 

The Board of Directors terminated the 2010
option plan on August 23, 2013. 

2014 Option Plan  

By Board Resolution effective January 27,
2014, the Company adopted a 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) to compensate employees and consulting groups in
their efforts to enhance the long-term shareholder value of the Company. Pursuant to the Plan, selected persons are offered opportunities
to participate in the Company's growth and success and are encouraged to acquire and maintain stock ownership in the Company. The
Plan grants options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock vesting at dates beginning on the date of grant and
issuable at chronological or performance increments. The Plan Administrator may also grandfather in existing options granted during
2013. The shareholders approved the 2014 Plan at the 2014 annual meeting. 

Under administration by the Compensation
Committee (the  Plan Administrator ), a maximum of 75,000,000 shares of common stock are available for issuance under
the Plan, subject to adjustment from time to time. Awards may be granted under the Plan to officers, directors, employees and consultants
of the Company and as the Plan Administrator selects. The Plan Administrator is authorized, in its sole discretion, to issue options
as incentive stock options, which shall be appropriately designated. The term of each option to purchase common stock of the Company
is established by the Plan Administrator or, if not so established, is 10 years from the grant date.  

The Plan Administrator establishes the
time at which each option shall vest and become exercisable. If not established in the instrument evidencing the option, the option
shall vest and become exercisable according to the following schedule: (i) after one year of the participant s continuous
employment or service with the company or its related corporations, one quarter of the total options will be vested and exercisable;
(ii) after each additional six-month period of continuous service completed thereafter, an additional one eighth of the total options
will be vested and exercisable; and (iii) after four years, 100% of the options will be vested and exercisable. Under the terms
of the Plan, the exercise price for shares shall be paid in cash or check to the Company unless the Plan Administrator determines
otherwise. 

13   

The Plan Administrator shall determine
whether the options will continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, if a participant ceases to
be employed or provide services to the Company. If not so established in the instrument evidencing such options, any portion of
an option that is not vested and exercisable on the date of termination of the participant s employment or service relationship
(the  Employment Termination Date ) shall expire on such date. Any portion of an option that is vested and exercisable
on the Employment Termination Date shall expire upon the earliest to occur of: (i) if the participant s Employment Termination
Date occurs by reason of retirement, disability or death, the one-year anniversary of such Employment Termination Date; (ii) if
the participant s Employment Termination Date occurs for reasons other than cause, retirement, disability or death, the three-month
anniversary of such Employment Termination Date; or (iii) the last day of the option term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
participant dies after the Employment Termination Date while the Option is otherwise exercisable, the portion of the option that
is vested and exercisable on such Employment Termination Date shall expire upon the earlier to occur of: (a) the last day of the
option term; or (b) the first anniversary of the date of death, unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise. 

If a participant is terminated for cause,
the options shall automatically expire at the time the Company first notifies the participant of the termination. If a participant s
employment is suspended pending investigation of whether they will be terminated for cause, the participant s rights under
any option shall be suspended during the period of investigation. Awards granted under the Plan may not be assigned, except, to
the extent permitted by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the  IRC ), and the Plan Administrator may permit
such assignment, transfer and exercisability, and may permit a participant to designate a beneficiary who may exercise the award
or receive compensation under the award after the participant s death. Any award permitted to be assigned shall be subject
to the terms and conditions contained in the instrument evidencing the award. 

The Plan may only be amended by the Company s
Board of Directors, as it deems advisable. Shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the extent required for
compliance with Section 422 of the IRC, as amended or any applicable law or regulation. The Board may suspend or terminate the
Plan at any time. Incentive stock options may not be granted more than 10 years after the later of the Plan s adoption by
the Board or the adoption by the Board of any amendment to the Plan that constitutes adoption of a new plan for the purpose of
Section 422 of the IRC. Participants who are residents of California shall be subject to additional terms and conditions until
the Common Stock becomes a publicly traded security, under the California Securities Code.

On July 21, 2015 the Company agreed to
reprice 750,000 options of an officer and director June 18, 2014 with an original exercise price of $1.67 to $0.75 exercise price.
The accounting effect of this resolution is to cancel the previous options and reissue new options with the new exercise price
of $0.75 with vested immediately as all other option terms remained the same and reduced option compensation by $318,270. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing
model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for stock awards. Compensation expense for stock awards is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of service awards and for performance-based awards, the Company recognizes the
expense when the performance condition is probable of being met. 

In determining the compensation cost of
the stock awards granted during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the fair value
of each grant had been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the weighted average assumptions
used in these calculations are summarized below:  

The Company reviews its current assumptions
on a periodic basis and adjusts them as necessary to ensure an accurate valuation. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
Federal Reserve Board s constant maturities of the U.S. Treasury bond obligations with terms comparable to the expected life
of the options at their issuance date. The Company uses historical data to estimate expected forfeitures, expected dividend yield,
expected volatility of the Company s stock and the expected life of the options. 

15   

The Company recorded $0 and $11,923,865
related to compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All compensation expense is
included in general and administrative expense. There was no tax benefit from recording this non-cash expense due to our income
tax valuation allowance and due to a portion of the options being incentive stock options. As of September 30, 2016, there was
$0 in unrecognized compensation expense.

Legal Matters  

Stephen E.
Flechner v. Standard Metals Processing, Inc.  

On April 29, 2014,
Stephen E. Flechner filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Standard Metals Processing,
Inc. alleging that Standard Metals had refused to allow him to exercise stock options granted to him pursuant to a Stock Option
Agreement, dated April 1, 2010, and a second Stock Option Agreement, dated January 21, 2011. On June 12, 2014, Standard Metals
filed an Answer and a Motion to Dismiss or, Alternatively, to Stay or Transfer the action to the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division . On January 16, 2015, Standard Metals filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On
January 23, 2015, the Court issued an Order granting in part and denying in part Standard Metals  Motion to Dismiss or, Alternatively,
to Stay or Transfer the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division. The Court
in its Order stayed further proceedings in Colorado pending the issuance of orders by the Alabama court. Thereafter, on January
26, 2015, the Court issued an Order vacating the February 20, 2015 Trial Preparation Conference and the March 9, 2015 Bench Trial.
On March 23, 2015, the Court issued an Order denying Standard Metals  Motion for Summary Judgment. On March 30, 2015, Flechner
filed a Motion to Lift the Stay. On March 31, 2015, the Court issued an Order granting Flechner s Motion to Lift the Stay.
On April 6, 2015, the Court issued an Order scheduling a Bench Trial for July 29, 2015. On April 9, 2015, Flechner filed a Motion
for Reconsideration of the Court s March 23, 2015 Order Denying Flechner s Motion to Enforce the Confidential Settlement
Agreement to Settle Certain Issues. On May 1, 2015, the Court issued an Order Granting Flechner s Motion to Enforce the Confidential
Settlement Agreement to Settle Certain Issues. On August 12, 2015 the United Stated District Court for the District of Colorado
issued a judgment in favor of Stephen E. Flechner for $2,157,000. An amended final judgment was ordered in adjudication of the

On April 11, 2016, the Company and Pure
Path executed an addendum removing Pure Path s ability to convert its note into shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Subsequently,
the Company retired and cancelled the entire class of Series B Preferred Stock, and such class is no longer available for issuance. 

NOTE 11   EARNINGS (LOSS) PER
SHARE   

Basic net loss per common share is computed
by dividing net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods
presented. Diluted net loss per common share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the periods presented, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued
upon exercise of options, warrants and conversion of convertible debt. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

At September 30, 2016, the weighted
average shares from stock options of 32,576,223, warrants of 6,275,640 and Convertible Promissory note shares of 1,000,000
were excluded from the diluted weighted average common share calculation due to the antidilutive effect such shares would
have on net loss per common share. The 5,000,000 shares in escrow pending the exchange for the Series A Preferred Stock are
considered issued but not outstanding.

History  

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. (formerly
known as Standard Gold Holdings, Inc., Standard Gold, Inc. and Princeton Acquisitions, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Colorado
on July 10, 1985. On September 29, 2009, we completed a share exchange agreement with Hunter Bates Mining Corporation, a Minnesota
corporation ( Hunter Bates ) and certain of its shareholders, in which Hunter Bates  shareholders exchanged all
of their capital securities into similar capital securities of ours (the  Hunter Bates Share Exchange ) and we adopted
the business model of Hunter Bates of minerals exploration and mining. Accordingly, the Hunter Bates Share Exchange represented
a change in control and Hunter Bates became our wholly owned subsidiary. 

Prior to September 29, 2009, Wits Basin
Precious Minerals Inc., a Minnesota corporation and public reporting company quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol  WITM 
( Wits Basin ) was the majority shareholder of Hunter Bates. Hunter Bates was formed in April 2008 to acquire the prior
producing gold mine properties (consisting of land, buildings, equipment, mining claims and permits) located in Central City, Colorado,
known as the  Bates-Hunter Mine.  

On March 15, 2011, we closed a series of
transactions, whereby we acquired certain assets of Shea Mining   Milling, LLC ( Shea Mining ), which assets include
land, buildings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment, water permits, mine tailings, mine dumps and the assignment
of a note payable, a lease and a contract agreement with permits. We completed the Shea Exchange Agreement in order to offer toll
milling services of precious minerals. Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles
to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as gold, silver, and platinum group metals. Custom milling
and refining can include many different processes to extract precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing
services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production
outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production. 

We determined that, due to a lack of connection
to Colorado, it was in the best interest of the Company to move its domicile to Nevada. The Company re-domiciled in Nevada from
Colorado in March 2013. 

Overview of the Company  

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. ( we, 
 us,   our,   Standard Metals  or the  Company ) has offices in Gadsden, Alabama
and through its subsidiary, a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our business plan is to purchase equipment and build a facility on our
Tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallugircal
plant, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant. 

We are required to obtain several permits
before we can begin construction of a small-scale mineral processing facility and the required additional buildings to conduct
permitted processing toll milling activities and commence operations. 

20   

WATER POLLUTION CONTROL PERMIT WITH
THE NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION   

Through the subsidiary of the Company s
wholly owned subsidiary, Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc. ( TCP ), a Water Pollution Control Permit ( WPCP )
Application was filed with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection ( NDEP ) Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation
( BMMR ) for the approval of the permits necessary for a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah
Property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing, and custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates
from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard mineral processing techniques including gravity
concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping. 

The WPCP must be approved prior to commencing
the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. We are still in the technical review stage of our WPCP. While
the Company awaits approval, we are preparing for construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors
that will be building the new 21,875 square foot processing plant, cleaning and preparing the property, and refurbishing a trailer
that will act as our construction office. 

In connection with our WPCP application,
NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager ( CEM ), (ii)
perform Meteoric Profile II water testing on ground water directly below the mill as well as surrounding wells located off site,
and (iii) determine baseline values of water using the Meteoric Profile II results. NDEP regulations require that the Company delay
any new construction planned for  metal extraction  until after the permits are in place. We hired Allstate-Nevada
Environmental Management, Inc., as our CEM to assist us with obtaining an NDEP WPCP and to help us fulfill all the requirements
of NDEP including the Meteoric Profile II analysis, as well as advise on the overall site cleanup and assisting with any other
NDEP requirements. 

Survey  

In March 2013, Advanced Surveying  
Professional Services, as our Professional Land Surveyor ( PLS ), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property
required for the application of our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,183 acres.
The scope of work our PLS completed includes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting
eight permanent monuments locating US Hwy 95, (iii) recording a professional map indicating longitude and latitude for all corners,
and (iv) providing a digital map accessible in AutoCad software. 

Site Preparation  

The Company received leased heavy equipment
on August 1, 2013, which was used to begin cleanup of the site to prepare it for the new construction. We ordered a pre-fabricated
building on November 4, 2013 and took delivery of the building on March 21, 2014. 

We have completed the initial grading of
specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal, and
the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new 21,875 square foot processing plant and have completed the removal
of all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that has accumulated on the land. 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES   

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. ( Standard
Metals  or the  Company ), seeks to establish itself as a custom processing permitted toll milling service provider.
Our business plan is to build a facility on our Tonopah property which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical
recovery plant. 

The Company s intention is to become
a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic minerals
from mined material. The Company is in the process of obtaining the permits needed for construction and operation of our permitted
custom processing toll milling facility with state of the art equipment capable of processing gold, silver and platinum metal groups.
Many junior miners do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility, yet they have a large supply of mined
material that requires milling be performed. It is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their
materials to processing mills owned by the large mining companies, or to other customers with badly needed milling and processing
services. 

While Nevada has a historic role as a mining
center with good proximate geology and ample mined product, very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains in the
state. During the last several decades, other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the
vertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services.
As a result, Standard Metals is in a unique position among processing facilities because it is capable of true permitted custom
processing. We have the only ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within 300 miles allowing us to serve miners
in the western United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. 

Many junior miners are undercapitalized,
have limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. Many large
mining companies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory, which does not make providing third party services worthwhile.
This provides the Company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services. 

Currently, the Company is waiting for the
approval of pending applications for the permits required for us to commence construction of a facility to conduct permitted custom
processing toll milling operations. 

21   

TOLL MILLING   

Toll milling is a process whereby mined
material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals
in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load can
include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore, carbon or concentrates. 

Procedure  

Ore is sent to our facility at the responsibility
and cost of the customer. The Company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure. The Company s
metallurgist will test the sample on site. To obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in a particular
sample, the Company can perform wet methods and dry methods. In the wet method, the sample is dissolved in a reagent, like acid,
until the purified metal is separated out. In the dry method, the sample is mixed with a flux (a substance such as borax or silica
that helps lower the melting temperature) and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux, leaving the purified
metal as residue. 

If it is determined that the sample is
approved for processing, the customer and the Company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton. If there is any
disagreement on the value, a third party referee determines the value by testing the sample. The Company charges either a flat
fee per ton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing, or a combination of both based
on the amount of work that is performed. 

There are various methods of extraction.
The Company will determine which method to use based upon the sample received. In most situations, a series of tests will be performed
on a bulk sample ranging in size from 250 to 1,000 pounds. A metallurgist will determine the best process or processes to use for
the extraction based on several factors. These include the composition of the host rock, mineralization of the host rock, whether
or not it is an oxide or sulphide ore body, and the particle size of the precious metal. After the metallurgist reviews these characteristics,
the Company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates, middlings, and tails. An assay is an investigative procedure
for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount of precious metals in ore. If there is too much
gold in the middling or tails, the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings
or tails the Company grinds the material to a coarser mesh. 

Some of our miner customers will be able
to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited
with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the
Company to dispose of those tailings. 

Concentrate/Leach Circuit  

Concentration is the separation of precious
minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density, magnetic or
electric and physiochemical. The Company will attempt to create a  concentrate  of minerals to reduce the size of each
ton processed. The Company may also receive concentrates from customers, especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is
not feasible. 

The leaching process uses chemicals to
extract the metals from the solid materials (concentrates) and bring them into a solution. Once the metals are in the solution,
it is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbon/resin. 

The metals will then be stripped from the
carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping.
The metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit. After this stage, the metals are either sold
or further refined off-site. The solution is recycled and used again to process additional material.

We receive monthly payments of from $608
per month from American Tower Corporation for a cellular tower located on our Tonopah land.  

On February 23, 2016 an auction was held
in which $222,597 of equipment was sold for $56,500. The net proceeds from this sale were paid to a former employee for past compensation. 

Interest Expense    

Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $210,471 compared to $196,253 for the respective period in 2015. The 2016 and 2015 amounts relate primarily
to the interest due on our notes payable: (i) the $2,500,000 secured, convertible promissory note issued to Pure Path on October
10, 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement of same date. All prior debt was subsumed under this note, the outstanding
of which was $2,229,187 plus accrued interest at 8% per annum on September 30, 2016; (ii) the short-term note payable; (iii) the
convertible notes issued in 2011 and 2012 and the notes with Tina Gregerson Family Properties, LLC, an entity controlled by
the CEO of the Company; (iv) convertible debt of $220,000; and (v) accounts payable. 

Interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $62,267, compared to $78,096 for the respective period in 2015. The 2016 and 2015 amounts relate primarily
to the interest due on our notes payable: (i) the $2,500,000 secured, convertible promissory note issued to Pure Path on October
10, 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement of same date. All prior debt was subsumed under this note, the outstanding
of which was $2,229,187 plus accrued interest at 8% per annum on September 30, 2016; (ii) the short-term note payable; (iii) the
convertible notes issued in 2011 and 2012 and the notes with Tina Gregerson Family Properties, LLC, an entity controlled by
the CEO of the Company; (iv) convertible debt of $220,000; and (v) accounts payable. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Liquidity is a measure of an entity s
ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual and operating needs as they arise. We have funded our operations and satisfied
our capital requirements through the issuance of short-term debt, convertible debt and through equity capital we have received
via certain shareholders exercising their warrants and loans from related parties during the three months periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. We do not anticipate generating sufficient net positive cash flows from our operations to fund the next twelve
months. We had a working capital deficit of $9,123,197 at September 30, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1,035 at September
30, 2016, representing an decrease of $5,621 from the cash and cash equivalents of $6,656 at September 30, 2015.  

Our cash reserves will not be sufficient
to meet our operational needs and thus, we need to raise additional capital to pay for our operational expenses and provide for
capital expenditures. Our basic operational expenses are currently estimated at approximately $70,000 per month. Above the basic
operational expenses, we estimate that we need approximately $17,500,000 to begin limited toll milling operations. If we are not
able to raise additional working capital, we may have to cease operations altogether. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we had net cash used in operating activities of $297,212, as compared to $613,101 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015.  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 we had net cash provided by investing activities of $56,500 and net cash used in investing activities of $43,528
respectively. The amount in 2016 was from the sale of equipment and 2015 was due to the funds required to conduct site preparation
on our Tonopah, Nevada property and purchase of machinery and equipment.  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $240,000 and $627,190, respectively.  

Summary  

Our existing sources of liquidity will
not provide enough cash to fund our development and operations and make the required payments on our debt service for the next
twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent entirely on raising funds through the sale of equity or
debt. We will continue our attempt to raise additional capital. Some of the possibilities available to us are through private equity
transactions, to develop a credit facility with a lender or the exercise of options and warrants. However, such additional capital
may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional capital, we would
be forced to cease operations altogether. 

23   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we did not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4) of the SEC s Regulation S-K.  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative  

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Under the supervision of, and the participation
of, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and is accumulated
and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation and taking into
account that certain material weaknesses existed as of December 31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. As a result of this conclusion, the financial
statements for the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared with particular attention to the material
weaknesses previously disclosed. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in internal controls that continue to exist as of September
30, 2016, we have concluded that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as required for interim financial statements. 

Due to the small number of employees dealing
with general administrative and financial matters and the expenses associated with increases to remediate the disclosure controls
and procedures that have been identified, the Company continued to operate without changes to its internal controls over financial
reporting for the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q while continuing to seek the expertise it needs to remediate
the material weaknesses at an appropriate cost benefit basis. 

PART II. OTHER  

  INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings     

Stephen E. Flechner v. Standard Metals
Processing, Inc.  

On April 29, 2014, Stephen E. Flechner
filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Standard Metals Processing, Inc. alleging that
Standard Metals had refused to allow him to exercise stock options granted to him pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement, dated April
1, 2010, and a second Stock Option Agreement, dated January 21, 2011. On June 12, 2014, Standard Metals filed an Answer and a Motion
to Dismiss or, Alternatively, to Stay or Transfer the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama,
Middle Division . On January 16, 2015, Standard Metals filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On January 23, 2015, the Court issued
an Order granting in part and denying in part Standard Metals  Motion to Dismiss or, Alternatively, to Stay or Transfer the
action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division . The Court in its Order stayed
further proceedings in Colorado pending the issuance of orders by the Alabama court. Thereafter, on January 26, 2015, the Court
issued an Order vacating the February 20, 2015 Trial Preparation Conference and the March 9, 2015 Bench Trial. On March 23, 2015,
the Court issued an Order denying Standard Metals  Motion for Summary Judgment. On March 30, 2015, Flechner filed a Motion
to Lift the Stay. On March 31, 2015, the Court issued an Order granting Flechner s Motion to Lift the Stay. On April 6, 2015,
the Court issued an Order scheduling a Bench Trial for July 29, 2015. On April 9, 2015, Flechner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
of the Court s March 23, 2015 Order Denying Flechner s Motion to Enforce the Confidential Settlement Agreement to Settle
Certain Issues. On May 1, 2015, the Court issued an Order Granting Flechner s Motion to Enforce the Confidential Settlement
Agreement to Settle Certain Issues. On August 12, 2015 the United Stated District Court for the District of Colorado issued a judgment
in favor of Stephen E. Flechner for $2,157,000. An amended final judgment was ordered in adjudication of the Complaint by the U.S.
District Court for the District of Colorado (the  Court ) on August 28, 2015 in favor of Flechner in the amount of
$2,157,000, plus interest through the date of judgment of $235,246, plus interest of $472.76/day from August 28, 2015 until paid
in full. The Company, in good faith anticipation of a settlement did not appeal the judgment and therefore, the Company s
notice of appeal was dismissed on November 17, 2015. This judgment is now non-appealable. The Company and Flechner entered into
a Settlement Agreement on November 24, 2015, wherein Flechner will receive $450,000 in cash payment and $250,000 in installment
payments. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not yet made a payment and has recorded an Accrual in the amount of judgment.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

The most significant risk factors applicable
to the Company are described in Part I Item 1A entitled  Risk Factors  of the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ). There have been no material changes to the
risk factors previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K. The risks described in the 2015 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing
the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management may materially adversely affect the Company s
business, financial condition, and/or operating results. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales
of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

The Company accepted an investment from
an unrelated third party of $20,000 for the purchase of 275,028 shares of restricted common stock. The investment was funded on
August 17, 2016 and the shares were issued on December 13, 2016. 

Preferred Stock   

On April 11, 2016 the Company and Pure
Path Capital Management LLC, a related party, Path executed an addendum removing Pure Path s ability to convert its note
into shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Subsequently, the Company retired and cancelled the entire class of Series B Preferred
Stock, which was never issued or outstanding and such class is no longer available for issuance. 

Promissory Notes  

The Company issued 5,000,000 shares of
restricted common stock on April 1, 2016 that are being held in escrow pending a Triggering Event under the agreement with the
holder of the Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 8   Shareholders Equity. 

Sales of the securities identified above
were made pursuant to privately negotiated transactions that did not involve a public offering of securities and, accordingly,
we believe that these transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
thereof and rules promulgated thereunder, Based on representations from the above-referenced investors, we have determined that
such investors were  accredited investors  (as defined by Rule 501 under the Securities Act) and are acquiring the
securities for investment and not distribution, and that they could bear the risks of the investment and could hold the securities
for an indefinite period of time, The investors received written disclosures that the securities had not been registered under
the Securities Act and that any resale must be made pursuant to a registration or an available exemption from such registration,
All of the foregoing securities are deemed restricted securities for purposes of the Securities Act.
