NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION    

Investors Real Estate Trust ( IRET ,  we  or  us ) is a self-advised real estate investment trust engaged in acquiring, owning and leasing real estate. We have elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute 90% of ordinary taxable income to shareholders, and, generally, are not subject to federal income tax on net income, except for taxes on undistributed REIT taxable income and taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ). Our TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular statutory rates. We have considered estimated future taxable income and have determined that there were no material income tax provisions or material net deferred income tax items for our TRS for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. Our properties are located mainly in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota, but also in the states of Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. As of October 31, 2016, we held for investment 86 multifamily properties with 12,751 apartment units and 2.7 million net rentable square feet in 30 healthcare and 14 other properties. We held for sale 14 multifamily property, 27 healthcare properties, 2 retail properties and 1 parcel of land as of October 31, 2016. We conduct a majority of our business activities through our consolidated operating partnership, IRET Properties, a North Dakota Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), as well as through a number of other consolidated subsidiary entities. 

All references to IRET, we or us refer to Investors Real Estate Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all our subsidiaries in which we maintain a controlling interest, including the Operating Partnership. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends April 30th.  

Our interest in the Operating Partnership was   88.2%   of the limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership ( Units ) as of October 31, 2016 and 88.1% as of April 30, 2016. Under the terms of the Operating Partnership s Agreement of Limited Partnership, limited partners have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem their Units for cash any time following the first anniversary of the date they acquired such Units ( Exchange Right ). When a limited partner exercises the Exchange Right, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to acquire such Units by either making a cash payment or exchanging the Units for our common shares of beneficial interest ( Common Shares ), on a one-for-one basis. The Exchange Right is subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the limited partner may not exercise the Exchange Right more than two times during a calendar year and the limited partner may not exercise for less than 1,000 Units, or, if such limited partner holds less than 1,000 Units, for less than all of the Units held by such limited partner. The Operating Partnership and some limited partners have contractually agreed to a holding period of greater than one year, a greater number of redemptions during a calendar year or other limitations to their Exchange Right. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements also reflect the ownership by the Operating Partnership of certain joint venture entities in which the Operating Partnership has a general partner or controlling interest. These entities are consolidated into our other operations, with noncontrolling interests reflecting the noncontrolling partners  share of ownership and income and expenses. 

UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. The year-end balance

Table of Contents  

sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included.  

The current period s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately may be achieved for the year. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard will eliminate the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts accounted for under ASC 840,   Leases.     The ASU   is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of this update to have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the guidance in ASU 2015-02 as of May 1, 2016, as more fully described in the Variable Interest Entity section below. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability to which they relate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to being presented as assets. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the guidance in ASU 2015-03 as of May 1, 2016. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  . Under ASU 2015-05, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Our adoption of the guidance in ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . ASU 2016-01 amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect adoption of this update to have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including by requiring lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet and making certain changes to lessor accounting. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax

consequences, accrual of compensation cost, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The cash flow issues include debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on our consolidated financial statements. 

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. The impairment evaluation is performed on assets by property such that assets for a property form an asset group. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, expected holding period of each asset group and legal and environmental concerns. If indicators exist, we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long-lived asset group against the carrying amount of that asset group. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset group. If our anticipated holding period for properties, the estimated fair value of properties or other factors change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, we recognized impairments of $40.9 million, $5.8 million, $4.7 million, and $2.8 million, respectively, on three multifamily properties and one parcel of unimproved land in Williston, North Dakota, due to deterioration of this energy-impacted market, which resulted in poor leasing activity and declining rental rates during the three months ended July 31, 2016, which should generally be a strong leasing period. These properties were written-down to estimated fair value based on an independent appraisal in the case of one property and management cash flow estimates and market data in the case of the remaining assets. The properties impaired for $40.9 million, $4.7 million, and $2.8 million are owned by joint venture entities in which we currently have an approximately 71.5%, 60% and 70% interest, respectively, but which are consolidated in our financial statements.  

During the six months ended October 31, 2015, we incurred a loss of approximately $3.6 million due to impairment of one office property and one parcel of land and eight multifamily properties. We recognized impairment of approximately $440,000 on an office property in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, which was written-down to estimated fair value during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 based on receipt of a market offer to purchase and our intent to dispose of the property. We recognized impairment of $1.3 million on a parcel of land in Grand Chute, Wisconsin based on its sale listing price and our intent to dispose of the property. We recognized impairment of $1.9 million on eight multifamily properties in St. Cloud, Minnesota which were written-down to estimated fair value during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 based on receipt of a market offer to purchase and our intent to dispose of the property. The impairment loss of the Eden Prairie, Minnesota property for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 is reported in discontinued operations. See Note 7 for additional information.    

HELD FOR SALE 

We classify properties as held for sale when they meet the U.S. GAAP criteria, which include: (a) management commits to and initiates a plan to sell the asset (disposal group), (b) the sale is probable and expected to be completed within one year under terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (disposal groups), and (c) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs. Depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale. Liabilities classified as held for sale consist of   

10 

Table of Contents  

liabilities to be included in the transaction and liabilities directly associated with assets that will be transferred in the transaction. Twenty-seven healthcare properties, fourteen multifamily properties, two commercial properties, and one parcel of land were classified as held for sale at October 31, 2016. Thirty-five healthcare properties, one multifamily property, one industrial property and three parcels of unimproved land were classified as held for sale at April 30, 2016. 

COMPENSATING BALANCES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; HOLDBACKS 

We maintain compensating balances, not restricted as to withdrawal, with several financial institutions in connection with financing received from those institutions and/or to ensure future credit availability. At October 31, 2016, our compensating balances totaled $14.8 million and consisted of the following: 

We have a number of mortgage loans under which the lender retains a portion of the loan proceeds or requires a deposit for the payment of construction costs or tenant improvements. The decrease of $1.9 million in lender holdbacks for improvements reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended October 31, 2016 is due primarily to the release of loan proceeds to us upon completion of construction and tenant improvement projects, while the increase of approximately $614,000 represents additional amounts retained by lenders for new projects. 

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND GOODWILL 

Upon acquisition of real estate, we record the intangible assets and liabilities acquired (for example, if the leases in place for the real estate property acquired carry rents above the market rent, the difference is classified as an intangible asset) at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives based on the period over which the assets and liabilities are expected to affect, directly or indirectly, the future cash flows of the real estate property acquired (generally the life of the lease). In the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we added $0 and $1.3 million in new intangible assets and $0 and approximately $101,000 of new intangible liabilities. The weighted average lives of the intangible assets acquired in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are 0 and .08 years, respectively. Amortization of intangibles related to above or below-market leases is recorded in real estate rentals in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization of other intangibles is recorded in depreciation/amortization related to real estate investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

Table of Contents  

Our identified intangible assets and intangible liabilities   at     October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The amortization of acquired below-market leases and acquired above-market leases reduced rental income by approximately $4,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and approximately $9,000 and $11,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimated annual amortization of acquired below-market leases, net of acquired above-market leases, for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 

Amortization of all other identified intangible assets (a component of depreciation and amortization expense) was approximately $321,000 and $331,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $995,000 and $523,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimated annual amortization of all other identified intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 

The excess of the cost of an acquired property over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The book value of goodwill as of   October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016   was $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The annual review at April 30, 2016 indicated no impairment to goodwill and there was no indication of impairment at October 31, 2016.  During the six months ended October 31, 2016, we classified as held for sale of one commercial property to which goodwill had been assigned, and as a result, approximately $17,000 of goodwill was derecognized. Approximately $35,000 and $17,000 of goodwill is included in assets held for sale at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, respectively. During the six months ended October 31, 2015, we disposed of seven commercial properties to which goodwill had been assigned, and as a result, approximately $193,000 of goodwill was derecognized. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at   

12 

Table of Contents  

the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.  On the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we combined utilities, maintenance, insurance, property management expenses and other property expenses onto a single line called property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes. We also combined depreciation/amortization related to real estate investments and amortization related to non-real estate investments onto a single line called depreciation and amortization. Additionally on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we reclassed acquisition and project costs from other expenses to acquisition and investment related costs. 

We report, in discontinued operations, the results of operations and the related gains or losses of properties that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and for which the disposition represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As the result of discontinued operations, retroactive reclassifications that change prior period numbers have been made. See Note 7 for additional information. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we classified as discontinued operations 34 senior housing properties, of which 8 were sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and 26 remained held for sale at October 31, 2016. 

PROCEEDS FROM FINANCING LIABILITY 

During fiscal year 2014, we sold a non-core assisted living property in exchange for $7.9 million in cash and a $29.0 million contract for deed. The buyer leased the property back to us, and also granted us an option to repurchase the property at a specified price at or prior to July 31, 2018. We accounted for the transaction as a financing liability due to our continuing involvement with the property and recorded the $7.9 million in sales proceeds within other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The balance of the liability as of October 31, 2016 was $7.9 million. 

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY 

As discussed in the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section, effective May 1, 2016, we adopted the guidance in ASU 2015-02.  As a result, the Operating Partnership and each of our less than wholly-owned real estate partnerships have been deemed to have the characteristics of a variable interest entity ( VIE ).  However, we were not required to consolidate any previously unconsolidated entities or deconsolidate any previously consolidated entities as a result of the change in classification. Accordingly, there has been no change to the recognized amounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations or amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We determined that an additional six consolidated partnerships, including the Operating Partnership, are VIEs under the new standard because the limited partners are not able to exercise substantive kick-out or participating rights. We are the VIEs primary beneficiary and the partnerships are required to be consolidated on our balance sheet because we have a controlling financial interest in the VIEs, and have both the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Because the Operating Partnership is a VIE, all of our assets and liabilities are held through a VIE.

NOTE 3   EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. We have no outstanding options, warrants, convertible stock or other contractual obligations requiring issuance of additional shares that would result in dilution of earnings. Upon the exercise of Exchange Rights, and in our sole discretion, we may issue shares in exchange for Units on a one-for-one basis after a minimum holding period of one year. The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015: 

NOTE 4   EQUITY    

Equity Awards  . During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we issued approximately 120,792 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $502,000, under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan, for executive officer share based compensation for future performance. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we issued approximately 378,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $1.4 million, under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan, for executive officer and trustee share based compensation for future performance. We also issued approximately 59,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $352,000, under our 2008 Incentive Award Plan, for trustee share based compensation for fiscal year 2016 performance. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we issued approximately 220,000 Common Shares, net of withholding, with a total grant-date value of approximately $1.6 million, under our 2008 Incentive Award Plan, for executive officer and trustee share based compensation for fiscal year 2015 performance. No shares were issued under an incentive award plan during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 

DRIP  . We have implemented a Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan ( DRIP ), which provides our common shareholders and the unitholders of the Operating Partnership an opportunity to invest their cash distributions in Common Shares and to purchase additional Common Shares through voluntary cash contributions. A DRIP participant cannot purchase additional Common Shares in excess of $10,000 per month, unless waived by us. We did not issue any waivers during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

Table of Contents  

As permitted under the DRIP, starting on October 1, 2015, we changed the source from which Common Shares will be purchased under the DRIP to open market transactions, which are not eligible for purchase price discounts. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, no shares were issued under the DRIP.   During the three months ended October 31, 2015, approximately 55,000 Common Shares with a total value included in equity of $377,000, and an average price per share after applicable discounts of $6.87, were issued under the DRIP.  During the six months ended October 31, 2016, no shares were issued under the DRIP.  During the six months ended October 31, 2015, approximately 821,000 Common Shares with a total value included in equity of $5.6 million, and an average price per share after applicable discounts of $6.85 were issued under the DRIP.  

Exchange Rights  . Pursuant to the exercise of Exchange Rights, during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, approximately 56,700 and 75,500 Common Shares were issued in exchange for Units, with a total value of approximately $134,000 and $279,000 included in equity.  During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 56,700 and 154,000 Common Shares were issued in exchange for Units, with a total value of approximately $134,000 and $855,000 included in equity.  

NOTE 5   SEGMENT REPORTING    

We report our results in two reportable segments, which are aggregations of similar properties: multifamily and healthcare, excluding our senior housing properties, which are classified as held for sale and discontinued operations at October 31, 2016.     

We measure the performance of our segments based on net operating income ( NOI ), which we define as   total real estate revenues and gain on involuntary conversion less real estate expenses (which consist of utilities, maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, property management expenses and other property expenses).   During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we removed offsite costs associated with property management and casualty-related amounts from our assessment of segment performance as a result of our announced strategic shift to focus solely on our multifamily segment. These expenses were removed from the operating results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to allow for the assessment of direct property costs in NOI, excluding allocated costs. We believe that NOI is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation, amortization, financing and general and administrative expense. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with US GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance.

The revenues and NOI for these reportable segments are summarized as follows for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, along with reconciliations to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Segment assets are also reconciled to total assets as reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Segment Assets and Accumulated Depreciation 

Segment assets are summarized as follows as of October 31, 2016, and April 30, 2016, along with reconciliations to the condensed consolidated financial statements: 

NOTE 6   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Litigation.    We are not a party to any legal proceedings which are expected to have a material effect on our liquidity, financial position, cash flows or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of legal actions for personal injury or property damage arising in the ordinary course of our business, most of which are covered by liability insurance. Various claims of resident discrimination are also periodically brought, most of which also are covered by insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of such legal proceedings and claims will not have a material effect on our liquidity, financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  

Insurance.    We carry insurance coverage on our properties in amounts and types that we believe are customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and are sufficient to achieve our risk management objectives. 

Purchase Options.    We have granted options to purchase certain of our properties to tenants under lease agreements. In general, the options grant the tenant the right to purchase the property at the greater of such property s appraised value or an annual compounded increase of a specified percentage of our initial cost for the property. As of October 31, 2016, the total investment cost, plus improvements, for the seven properties subject to purchase options was $77.4 million, and the total gross rental revenue from these properties was $3.7 million for the six months ended October 31, 2016. 

Environmental Matters.    Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal of, or remediation of, certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under the property. While we currently have no knowledge of any material violation of   

18 

Table of Contents  

environmental laws, ordinances or regulations at any of our properties, there can be no assurance that areas of contamination will not be identified at any of our properties, or that changes in environmental laws, regulations or cleanup requirements would not result in material costs to us. 

Restrictions on Taxable Dispositions.    Approximately 49 of our properties, consisting of approximately 762,000 square feet of our combined commercial properties and 4,603 apartment units, are subject to restrictions on our ability to resell in taxable transactions. These restrictions are contained in agreements we entered into with some of the sellers or contributors of the properties, and are effective for varying periods. The real estate investment amount of these properties (net of accumulated depreciation) was $435.9 million at October 31, 2016. We do not believe that these restrictions materially affect the conduct of our business or decisions whether to dispose of these properties during the restriction periods because we generally hold properties for investment purposes, rather than for sale.  Historically, where we have deemed it to be in the Company s and the shareholders  best interests to dispose of restricted properties, we have done so through tax-deferred transactions under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.  

Exchange Value of Units  .  Whenever limited partners of the Operating Partnership exercise their Exchange Rights, we have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire such Units in exchange for either cash or our Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. If Units are exchanged for cash, the amount of cash per Unit is equal to the average of the daily market price of a Common Share for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of valuation of the Unit.  As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate exchange value of the then-outstanding Units of the Operating Partnership owned by limited partners was approximately $99.1 million and $112.6 million, respectively. All Units receive the same cash distributions as those paid on our Common Shares.   

Joint Venture Buy/Sell Options.    Several of our joint venture agreements contain buy/sell options in which each party under certain circumstances has the option to acquire the interest of the other party, but do not generally require that we buy our partners  interests. However, from time to time, we have entered into joint venture agreements which contain options compelling us to acquire the interest of the other parties. We currently have one such joint venture, IRET-Minot Apartments, in which our joint venture partner can, for the four-year period from February 6, 2016 through February 5, 2020, compel us to acquire the partner s interest for a price to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement.  The joint venture partner s interest is reflected as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11 for additional information. 

Tenant Improvements  . In entering into leases with commercial tenants, we may commit to fund improvements or build-outs of the rented space to suit tenant requirements. These tenant improvements are typically funded at the beginning of the lease term, and we are accordingly exposed to some risk of loss if a tenant defaults prior to the expiration of the lease term and the rental income that was expected to cover the cost of the tenant improvements is not received. As of October 31, 2016, we are committed to fund $6.0 million in tenant improvements within approximately the next 12 months.  

Development Project.    As of October 31, 2016, we had a development project underway during the quarter, the costs for which have been capitalized, as follows: 

(1) 

Amount for Monticello Crossings includes costs for to a portion of the development project that was placed into service during the quarter ended October 31, 2016.     

This development project is subject to various contingencies, and no assurances can be given that it will be completed within the time frames or on the terms currently expected. 

Construction interest capitalized for the three month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and 2015, respectively, was approximately $145,000 and $1.1 million for development projects completed and in progress. Construction interest

Table of Contents  

capitalized for the six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was approximately $298,000 and $3.4 million for development projects completed and in progress. 

Pending Disposition.   We currently have signed sales agreements for the disposition of the following properties. These pending dispositions are subject to various closing conditions and contingencies, and no assurances can be given that the transactions will be completed on the terms currently proposed, or at all: 

26 senior housing properties, 1 multifamily property and 1 parcel of unimproved land in various states for a total sale price of $236.0 million; and     

a retail property in Grand Forks, North Dakota, for a sale price of $4.0 million.     

NOTE 7   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

We report in discontinued operations the results of operations and any gain or loss on sale of a property or group of properties that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and for which the disposition represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. During fiscal year 2016, we determined that our strategic plan to exit the office and retail segments met the criteria for discontinued operations. Accordingly, 48 office properties, 17 retail properties and 1 healthcare property were classified as held for sale and subsequently sold during fiscal year 2016. Additionally, we determined that our strategic decision to exit senior housing, which was a subset of our healthcare segment, met the criteria for discontinued operations and we consequently classified 34 senior housing properties as held for sale and discontinued operations at April 30, 2016. Eight of those senior housing properties were sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and the remaining 26 senior housing properties continued to be classified as held for sale and discontinued operations at October 31, 2016. 

The following information shows the effect on net income and the gains or losses from the sales of properties classified as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015: 

(1) 

Interest expense for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015 includes $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively of default interest related to a $122.6 million non-recourse loan by one of our subsidiaries. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, ownership of the nine properties serving as collateral on the loan was transferred to the mortgage lender and the debt obligation and accrued interest was removed from our balance sheet.

NOTE 8   ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE AND DISPOSITIONS 

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS 

We added no new real estate properties to our portfolio through property acquisitions during the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $71.8 million in the six months ended October 31, 2015. However, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we purchased the remaining 41.41% minority interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price totaling $4.9 million. We expensed approximately $153,000 of transaction costs related to the acquisitions in the six months ended October 31, 2015.

NOTE 9   MORTGAGES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT 

Most of the properties we own serve as collateral for separate mortgage loans on single properties or groups of properties. The majority of these mortgages payable are non-recourse to us, other than for standard carve-out obligations such as fraud, waste, failure to insure, environmental conditions and failure to pay real estate taxes.     Interest rates on mortgages payable range from 2.49% to 7.94%, and the mortgages have varying maturity dates from the current fiscal year through July 1, 2036. As of October 31, 2016, our management believes there are no material defaults or material compliance issues in regard to any mortgages payable.  

Of the mortgages payable, including mortgages on properties held for sale, the balances of fixed rate mortgages totalled $617.7 million at October 31, 2016 and $689.3 million at April 30, 2016. The balances of variable rate mortgages totalled $226.9 million and $196.8 million as of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, respectively. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in market interest rates. Most of the fixed rate mortgages have substantial pre-payment penalties. As of October 31, 2016, the weighted average rate of interest on our mortgage debt was 4.55%, compared to 4.54% on April 30, 2016. The aggregate amount of required future principal payments on mortgages payable as of October 31, 2016, is as follows:

Table of Contents  

In addition to the individual mortgage loans comprising our $844.6 million of mortgage indebtedness, we also have a revolving, multi-bank line of credit with First International Bank and Trust, Watford City, North Dakota, as lead bank, which had, as of October 31, 2016, lending commitments of $100.0 million. This line of credit is not included in our mortgage indebtedness total. As of October 31, 2016, the line of credit was secured by mortgages on 17 properties. Under the terms of the line of credit, properties may be added and removed from the collateral pool with the agreement of the lenders. Participants in this credit facility as of October 31, 2016 included, in addition to First International Bank, the following financial institutions: The Bank of North Dakota, First Western Bank and Trust, Dacotah Bank, Highland Bank, American State Bank   Trust Company, Town   Country Credit Union, WoodTrust Bank, United Community Bank and United Bankers  Bank. As of October 31, 2016, the line of credit had an interest rate of 4.75% and a minimum outstanding principal balance requirement of $17.5 million. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, we had borrowed $47.5 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The line of credit includes covenants and restrictions requiring us to achieve on a fiscal and calendar quarter basis a debt service coverage ratio on borrowing base collateral of 1.25x in the aggregate and 1.00x on individual assets in the collateral pool. We are also required to maintain minimum depository account(s) totaling $6.0 million with First International Bank, of which $1.5 million is to be held in a non-interest bearing account. As of October 31, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with the line of credit s covenants.  

NOTE 10   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures   defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value.  The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, as follows:   

Level 1:  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 

Level 2:  Significant other observable inputs 

Level 3:  Significant unobservable inputs 

Fair value estimates may be different than the amounts that may ultimately be realized upon sale or disposition of the assets and liabilities.  

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis 

We had no assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016. 

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis 

There were no non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at October 31, 2016. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at April 30, 2016 consisted of real estate held for sale

Table of Contents  

that was written-down to estimated fair value during fiscal year 2016. See Note 2 for additional information on impairment losses recognized during fiscal years 2017 and 2016. The aggregate fair value of these assets by their levels in the fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

As of April 30, 2016, we estimated fair value on two properties held for sale based upon receipt of individual market offers and our intent to dispose of the properties.   

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial assets and liabilities.   The fair values of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements except for debt. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents.   The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity. 

Other Investments.   The carrying amount, or cost plus accrued interest, of the certificates of deposit approximates fair value. 

Other Debt.   For variable rate loans that re-price frequently, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated based on the discounted cash flows of the loans using relevant treasury interest rates plus credit spreads (Level 2).  

Line of Credit.    The carrying amount approximates fair value because the variable rate debt re-prices frequently. 

Mortgages Payable.   For variable rate loans that re-price frequently, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated based on the discounted cash flows of the loans using relevant treasury interest rates plus credit spreads (Level 2). 

The estimated fair values of our financial instruments as of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, are as follows: 

NOTE 11   REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 

Redeemable noncontrolling interests on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the noncontrolling interest in joint ventures in which our unaffiliated partner, at its election, could require us to buy its interest at a purchase price to be determined by an appraisal conducted in accordance with the terms of the agreement, or at a negotiated price. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented at the greater of their carrying amount or redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the value from period to period are charged to Common Shares on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We currently have one joint venture, IRET-Minot Apartments, LLC, in which our joint venture partner can, for the four-year period from February 6, 2016 through February 5, 2020, compel us to acquire the

Table of Contents  

partner s interest for a price to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement. IRET-Minot Apartments, LLC owns the Commons and Landing at Southgate properties in Minot, ND. 

As of October 31, 2016, the estimated redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was $8.6 million. Below is a table reflecting the activity of the redeemable noncontrolling interests. 

NOTE 12   SHARE BASED COMPENSATION 

Share based awards are provided to officers, non-officer employees and trustees under our 2015 Incentive Plan approved by shareholders on September 15, 2015, which allows for awards in the form of cash and unrestricted and restricted Common Shares, up to an aggregate of 4,250,000 shares, over the ten year period in which the plan will be in effect. Through October 31, 2016, awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan consisted of restricted and unrestricted Common Shares. 

Prior to the approval of our 2015 Incentive Plan, share based awards were provided to officers, non-officer employees and trustees under the our 2008 Incentive Award Plan, which was approved by shareholders on September 16, 2008, which allowed for awards in the form of cash and unrestricted and restricted Common Shares, up to an aggregate of   2,000,000   shares, over the period in which the plan will be in effect. Through October 31, 2016, awards under the 2008 Incentive Award Plan consisted of cash and restricted and unrestricted Common Shares. 

Long-Term Incentive Plan 

Under the 2008 Incentive Award Plan, our officers and non-officer employees could earn share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Program ( LTIP ) adopted pursuant to the plan, which was a backward-looking program that measured performance over a one-year performance period beginning on the first day of each fiscal year. Such awards were payable to the extent deemed earned in shares, 50% of which vested on the last day of the performance period and 50% of which vested on the first anniversary of the end of the performance period. Such awards utilized the sole performance metric of the three-year average of the annual absolute total shareholder return ( TSR ). 

Under the 2015 Incentive Plan, our officers and non-officer employees may earn share awards under a revised long-term incentive program, a forward-looking program that measures long-term performance over the stated performance period. Such awards are payable to the extent deemed earned in shares. The terms of the long-term incentive awards granted under the revised program may vary from year to year. 

Fiscal Year 2017 LTIP Awards 

Awards granted on June 22, 2016 consist of time-based restricted share awards and performance restricted share awards for 45,651 and 273,901 shares, respectively, that are classified as equity awards. The time-based restricted share awards vest as to one-third of the shares on each June 22, 2017, May 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019.  We recognize compensation expense associated with the time-based restricted share awards ratably over the requisite service periods. 

The performance restricted share awards are earned based on our TSR as compared to the MSCI US REIT Index over a forward looking three-year period. The maximum number of shares that are eligible to be earned are the shares that were granted. Earned awards (if any) will fully vest as of the last day of the measurement period. These awards have market conditions in addition to service conditions that must be met for the awards to vest. We recognize compensation expense ratably based on the grant date fair value, as determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model, and regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the performance restricted share awards ultimately vest. Therefore, previously recorded compensation expense is not adjusted in the event that the market conditions are not achieved. We based the expected volatility on the historical volatility of our daily closing share price. We based the risk-free interest rate on the interest rates on U.S. treasury bonds with a maturity equal to the remaining performance period of the award.

We based the expected term on the performance period of the performance restricted share award. The assumptions used to value the performance restricted share awards were an expected volatility of 23.8%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.86% and an expected life of 2.85 years. The share price at the grant date, June 22, 2016, was $6.24.   

Awards granted on August 8, 2016 consist of time-based restricted share awards and performance restricted share awards for 43,549 and 77,243 shares, respectively, that ware classified as equity awards. Of the time-based awards, 12,874 vest as to one-third of the shares on each August 8, 2017, May 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019.  The remaining 30,675 time-based awards vest as to one-third of the shares on each August 8, 2017, August 8, 2018 and August 8, 2019.  

The assumptions used to value the performance restricted awards granted on August 8, 2016 were an expected volatility of 24.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.83% and an expected life of 2.72 years. We based the expected volatility on the historical volatility of our daily closing price. The share price at the grant date, August 8, 2016, was $6.57.  

Trustee Awards 

We award share-based compensation to our non-management trustees on an annual basis. Awards for 59,000 shares granted on June 22, 2016 consisted of time-based restricted share awards that vest on May 1, 2017. We recognize compensation expense associated with the time-based restricted share awards ratably over the requisite service periods. 

Total Compensation Expense 

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for all outstanding share based awards was approximately $603,000 and $539,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $865,000 and $605,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 13   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Investment Banking Services 

We have an investment banking relationship with BMO Capital Markets Corp. ( BMO ). Mark O. Decker, Jr., our President and Chief Investment Officer since August 5, 2016, has been deemed a related party due to family members serving in various roles with BMO.  

On March 28, 2016, we engaged BMO to act as our exclusive financial advisor regarding the sale of our senior housing portfolio. Under the terms of this engagement, BMO will be entitled to compensation based on a percentage of the aggregate value of the transaction(s). As previously announced, on August 26, 2016, IRET Properties and its various subsidiaries entered into six sales agreements regarding 26 senior housing properties and one multifamily property for approximately $236.0 million in cash. It is anticipated that such sales will close in calendar year 2017.  

Also, on July 28, 2015, we engaged BMO to provide general financial and investment banking services, which included a right of first refusal to serve as lead financial advisor for large acquisition or disposition transactions for which we engage a financial advisor. The agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason, and remains currently in effect.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION   

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, as well as our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, which are included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016.  

Forward Looking Statements.   Certain matters included in this discussion are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the following statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations expressed will actually be achieved. Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, including general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, the general level of interest rates and the availability of financing and various other economic risks inherent in the business of owning and operating investment real estate. 

Overview 

We are a self-advised equity REIT engaged in owning and operating income-producing real estate properties. Our investments include multifamily, healthcare and other properties located primarily in the upper Midwest states of Minnesota and North Dakota. As of October 31, 2016, we held for investment 86 multifamily properties containing 12,751 apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $1.0 billion, 30 healthcare properties and 14 other properties, containing approximately 2.7 million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of $330.3 million.     We held for sale 14 multifamily property, 27 healthcare properties, 2 retail properties and 1 parcel of land as of October 31, 2016. 

Our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multifamily and commercial leases. Our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy. This strategy is implemented by growing income-producing assets in desired geographical markets in real estate classes we believe will provide a consistent return on investment for our shareholders. We have paid quarterly distributions continuously since our first distribution in 1971. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016, under the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  There have been no significant changes to those policies during the three months ended October 31, 2016. 

Second Quarter Activities  

Summarized below are transactions that occurred during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2017: 

As part of our strategic plan to sell our senior housing portfolios, we disposed of eight senior housing properties and one parcel of unimproved land for a sale price totaling $43.9 million.     

We purchased the remaining 41.41% minority interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price totaling $4.9 million.      

Same-store and Non-same-store Properties 

Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have provided certain information on a same-store and non-same-store properties basis. Information provided on a same-store properties basis includes the results of properties that we have owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties sold or classified as   

30 

Table of Contents  

held for sale, and which, in the case of development or re-development properties, have achieved a target level of occupancy of 90% for multifamily properties and 85% for healthcare and other properties.  

For the comparison of the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, all or a portion of 50 properties were non-same-store, of which 12 were redevelopment or in-service development properties.    

While there are judgments to be made regarding changes in designation, we typically remove properties from same-store to non-same-store when redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact on property net operating income within the fiscal year. Acquisitions are moved to same-store once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion. Our development projects in progress are not included in our non-same-store properties category until they are placed in-service, which occurs upon the substantial completion for a commercial development property and upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy for a multifamily development project. They are then subsequently moved from non-same-store to same-store when the property has been in-service for the entirety of both periods being compared and has reached the target level of occupancy specified above. 

Market Conditions and Outlook  

The demand for investment and institutional quality real estate in our markets is strong. Investors have abundant equity and access to debt to facilitate acquisitions and developments. Prices and sales volumes are strong. Fundamentals are favorable across property types. The exception for us is in various North Dakota markets where energy and commodity market weakness coupled with increased supply caused us to experience elevated vacancies and offer lower rents to attract residents. 

We experienced generally stable trends across most of our apartment investments during the quarter ended October 31, 2016, except in certain commodity and supply impacted markets. Our ability to maintain occupancy levels and raise rents remains dependent on continued healthy employment and wage growth. We continue to observe considerable multifamily development activity in our markets, and as this new construction is completed, we will experience increased competition for residents. However, developers of new apartment projects are trying to push up market rents to support the increasing costs of new developments. Many existing apartment owners of modestly older properties are making significant upgrades to their units and raising rents. The calendar 2016 economic outlook of the Ninth Federal Reserve District, which overlays most of our geographic footprint, is positive according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.  Increases in employment and personal income growth are projected. The biggest challenge facing employers is hiring qualified workers. The unemployment rate is generally below the national average in most of the district s states.  

Our healthcare segment consists of medical office properties. The same-store healthcare segment remains stable with occupancy at 92.8%. A significant portion of our medical office portfolio is on campus and located in the Minneapolis Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ) which has a 9.5% on campus vacancy rate as of Q2 2016 according to Colliers International.

Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes.   Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by 5.1% to $15.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $15.1 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Non-same-store properties realized an increase of $1.1 million while expenses at same-store properties decreased by $376,000. The decrease at same-store properties was attributable to a decrease in casualty related costs. 

Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by 11.7% to $31.9 million for the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $28.5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year.  Of this $3.3 million increase, $2.2 million was attributable to non-same-store properties, and $1.1 million was attributable to same-store properties, primarily due to an increase in general maintenance expenses and an increase in the bad debt provision expense.    

Real Estate Taxes.    Real estate taxes increased by 17.6% to $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $4.9 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. An increase of $627,000 was attributable to non-same-store properties while same-store properties realized an increase of $233,000. 

Real estate taxes increased 16.7% to $11.3 million for the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $9.7 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. An increase of $1.4 million was attributable to non-same-store properties while same-store properties realized an increase of $213,000.

Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased by 9.1% to $13.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $12.4 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to depreciation on new developments placed in service and acquisitions. 

Depreciation and amortization related to real estate investments increased by 17.7% to $27.8 million in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $23.6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to depreciation on new developments placed in service and acquisitions. 

Impairment of Real Estate Investments.    We recognized $0 and $1.9 million of impairment in continuing operations during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognized $54.2 million and $3.2 million of impairment in continuing operations during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 2   of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information. 

General and Administrative Expenses.    General and administrative expenses decreased by 7.9% to $2.7 million in the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $2.9 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in short term incentive plan expense. The decrease in general and administrative expense in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year was immaterial. 

Acquisition and Investment Related Costs.    Acquisition and investment related costs decreased to approximately $4,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $391,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased acquisition costs and decreased costs related to development projects we are no longer pursuing. 

Acquisition and investment related costs decrease to approximately $47,000 in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $398,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased acquisition costs and decreased costs related to development projects we are no longer pursuing. 

Other Expenses.    The increase in other expenses in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year was immaterial. Other expenses increased approximately $438,000 to $1.7 million in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to third-party consulting costs.  

Interest Expense.    Components of interest expense in the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows. 

Mortgage interest increased by 11.8% to $9.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $8.5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Mortgages on non-same-store properties   added approximately $938,000 and $2.7 million to our mortgage interest expense in the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, respectively, while mortgage interest on same-store properties decreased approximately $24,000 and $97,000, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to loan payoffs and refinancings.  

Interest expense on our line of credit increased to approximately $281,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $241,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a higher average outstanding balance during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Interest expense on our line of credit decreased to approximately $494,000 in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $1.2 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance during fiscal year 2017.

Other interest consists of interest on construction loans, security deposits and special assessments, as well as amortization of loan costs, offset by capitalized construction interest. Other interest increased by approximately $847,000 to approximately $868,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in capitalized construction interest. Other interest increased to approximately $1.7 million in the six months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $(732,000) in the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in capitalized construction interest. 

Interest and Other Income.   We recorded interest income in the second quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 of approximately $600,000 and $565,000, respectively, and during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 of $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The change between periods was immaterial. 

Other income decreased 63.0% to approximately $37,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year and increase 237.7% to approximately $510,000 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The changes between periods was primarily due to changes in real estate tax appeal refunds. 

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate and Other Investments.   We recorded in continuing operations a net loss of approximately $103,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and no gain or loss in the same period of the prior fiscal year.  We recorded in continuing operations a net gain of $8.9 million and a net loss of approximately $175,000 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Properties sold in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are detailed below in the section captioned  Property Acquisitions and Dispositions.     

Income from Discontinued Operations.    We recorded income from discontinued operations of $10.4 million and $16.9 million, respectively, in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and $14.1 million and $17.6 million in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 7 of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information on discontinued operations. 

Occupancy 

Occupancy as of October 31, 2016 compared to October 31, 2015 decreased in our multifamily and healthcare segments on a same-store basis. Occupancy represents the actual number of units or square footage leased divided by the total number of units or square footage at the end of the period.  

Occupancy Levels on a Same-Store Property and All Property Basis: 

Net Operating Income 

Net Operating Income ( NOI ) is a non-US GAAP measure which we define as total real estate revenues and gain on involuntary conversion less real estate expenses (which consist of utilities, maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance, property management expenses and other property expenses). We believe that NOI is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation, amortization, financing and general and administrative expense.  NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with US GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance. 

The following tables show real estate revenues, real estate operating expenses and NOI by reportable operating segment for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  For a reconciliation of NOI of reportable segments to net income as reported, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

35 

Table of Contents  

The tables also show NOI by reportable operating segment on a same-store property and non-same-store property basis. This comparison allows us to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income. Management believes that measuring performance on a same-store property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our properties are performing year over year. Management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing NOI, renewing the leases of existing tenants, controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements.   The discussion below focuses on the main factors affecting real estate revenue and real estate expenses from same-store properties. Since changes from one fiscal year to another in real estate revenue and expenses from non-same-store properties are due to the addition of those properties to our real estate portfolio, such information is less useful for evaluating the ongoing operational performance of our real estate portfolio.  

All Segments 

The following table of selected operating data reconciles NOI to net income and provides the basis for our discussion of NOI by segment in the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

An analysis of NOI by segment follows.  

Multifamily 

Real estate revenue from same-store properties in our multifamily segment decreased by 1.7% or $486,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in scheduled rent of $244,000 and an increase in vacancy of $467,000.  These decreases were offset by an increase in the resident utility billings system  RUBS  revenue of $288,000 while all other fee items combined decreased by $63,000.  The overall   decrease of 1.7% was attributable to the operating results in our Minot and Williston, North Dakota markets.  The balance of our portfolio in our ten other markets realized an increase in revenue of $278,000 or 1.1%.  

Real estate expenses at same-store properties in our multifamily segment decreased by 0.9% or $115,000 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in insurance costs of $290,000 primarily due to a decrease in under deductible insurance claims. All other real estate expenses combined increased by $175,000. 

Real estate revenue from same-store properties in our multifamily segment decreased by 2.3% or $1.3 million in the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

Analysis of Commercial Credit Risk and Leases 

Credit Risk 

The following table lists our top ten commercial tenants on October 31, 2016, for all commercial properties owned by us, including healthcare, other commercial properties and those held for sale, measured by percentage of total commercial minimum rents as of October 1, 2016.  Our results of operations are dependent on, among other factors, the economic health of our tenants. We attempt to mitigate tenant credit risk by working to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting criteria and monitoring our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. We believe that our credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that no individual tenant accounts for more than 10% of our total real estate rentals, although affiliated entities of Edgewood Vista together accounted for approximately 30.1% of our total commercial minimum rents as of October 1, 2016.   

As of October 31, 2016, 15 of our 40 commercial properties held for investment, along with our held for sale properties including all 20 of our Edgewood Vista properties and all 5 of our Wyoming senior housing properties, were leased under triple net leases under which the tenant pays a monthly lump sum base rent as well as all costs associated with the property, including property taxes, insurance, replacement, repair or restoration, in addition to maintenance. The failure by any of our triple net tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties in accordance with the terms of their respective triple net leases could adversely affect their business reputations and ability to attract and retain residents and customers to our properties, which could have an indirect adverse effect on us. 

We regularly monitor the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, including our triple net tenants. The metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant s liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and to the industry in which it operates, and include the tenant s credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which it operates. These factors may change over time. Prior to signing a lease with a tenant, we generally assesses the prospective tenant s credit quality through review of its financial statements and tax returns, and the result of that review is a factor in establishing the rent to be charged (e.g., higher risk   

39 

Table of Contents  

tenants will be charged higher rent). Over the course of a lease, our property management and asset management personnel have regular contact with tenants and tenant employees, and, where the terms of the lease permit, receive tenant financial information for periodic review or review publicly-available financial statements in the case of public company tenants or non-profit entities, such as hospital systems, whose financial statements are required to be filed with state agencies. Through these means we monitor tenant credit quality.

Affiliates of Edgewood Vista are tenants in our senior housing properties which are classified as held for sale and discontinued operations at October 31, 2016.     

Healthcare Leasing Activity 

During fiscal year 2017, we have executed new and renewal healthcare leases for our same-store properties on 21,843 square feet for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 54,067 square feet for the six months ended October 31, 2016. Due to our leasing efforts, occupancy in our same-store healthcare portfolio remained strong at 92.8% as of October 31, 2016. 

The total leasing activity for our same-store healthcare properties, expressed in square feet of leases signed during the period, and the resulting occupancy levels, are as follows: 

Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 and 2015

Healthcare Lease Expirations  

Our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates and base rents primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re-lease expiring space. The following table reflects the in-service portfolio lease expiration schedule of our consolidated healthcare properties, including square footage and annualized base rent for expiring leases, as of October 31, 2016.

Assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal or termination options, and including leases renewed prior to expiration. Also excludes 1,361 square feet of space occupied by us.     

Because of the dispersed locations of a substantial portion of the portfolio s properties in secondary and tertiary markets, information on current market rents is difficult to obtain, is highly subjective and is often not directly comparable between properties. As a result, we believe that the increase or decrease in effective rent on our recent leases is the most objective and meaningful information available regarding rent trends and the relationship between rents on leases expiring in the near term and current market rents across our markets. We believe that rents on our new and renewed leases generally approximate market rents. 

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we had no acquisitions of property, however, we purchased the remaining 41.41% minority interest in the joint venture entity that owns the Red 20 multifamily property for a purchase price totaling $4.9 million. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we sold eight healthcare properties along with the adjacent parcel of unimproved land for a total sales price of $43.9 million.   See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a table detailing our acquisitions and dispositions during the six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

Development Projects 

The following tables provide additional detail, as of October 31, 2016, on our in-service (completed) development project and development project in progress. These projects are excluded from the   same-store   pool. We measure initial yield on our development projects upon completion and achievement of target lease-up levels by measuring net operating income from the development against the cost of the project. Estimated initial yield on the project in progress listed below is approximately 6.0%.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS 

We consider Funds from Operations ( FFO ) a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT. We use the definition of FFO adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT ). NAREIT defines FFO to mean  net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  In addition, in October 2011, NAREIT clarified its computation of FFO to exclude impairment charges for all periods presented. Because of limitations of the FFO definition adopted by NAREIT, we have made certain interpretations in applying the definition. We believe all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the NAREIT definition are consistent with the definition. 

Management considers that FFO, by excluding depreciation costs, impairment write-downs, the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by US GAAP, is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on our operating results. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with US GAAP assumes, through depreciation, that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time. However, real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. NAREIT s definition of FFO, by excluding depreciation costs, reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and that depreciation charges required by US GAAP may not reflect underlying economic realities. Additionally, the exclusion in NAREIT s definition of FFO of impairment write-downs and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, assists our management and investors in identifying the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of our investments, and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. FFO is used by our management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.  

While FFO is widely used by us as a primary performance metric, not all real estate companies use the same definition of FFO or calculate FFO in the same way. Accordingly, FFO presented here is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with US GAAP as a measure of our performance, but rather should be considered as an additional, supplemental measure, and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with US GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs or our ability to service indebtedness or make distributions. 

43 

Table of Contents  

FFO applicable to Common Shares and Units for the three months ended October 31, 2016 increased to $16.5 million compared to $8.1 million for the comparable period ended October 31, 2015, an increase of 103.7%. FFO applicable to Common Shares and Units for the six months ended October 31, 2016 increased to $32.3 million compared to $30.1 million for the comparable period ended October 31, 2015, an increase of 7.3%.

DISTRIBUTIONS 

The following distributions per Common Share and Unit were paid during the six months ended October 31 of fiscal years 2017 and 2016: 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

OVERVIEW 

Our principal liquidity demands are maintaining distributions to the holders of Common Shares, preferred shares and Units; capital improvements and repairs and maintenance to properties; acquisition of additional properties; property development; tenant improvements; and debt service and repayments. 

44 

Table of Contents  

We have historically met our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by our operating activities, and, from time to time, through draws on secured and unsecured lines of credit. As of October 31, 2016, we had one multi-bank line of credit with a total commitment capacity of $100.0 million, secured by mortgages on 17 properties. Management considers our ability to generate cash from property operating activities, cash-out refinancing of existing properties and, from time to time, draws on our line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand, cash flow generated from property operations, cash-out refinancing of existing properties, and/or new borrowings. However, the real estate market continues to be subject to various market factors that can result in reduced tenant demand, occupancies and rental rates. In the event of deterioration in property operating results, or absent our ability to successfully continue cash-out refinancing of existing properties and/or new borrowings, we may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives, including scaling back development activities, capital improvements and renovations and reducing the level of distributions to shareholders.  

To the extent we do not satisfy our long-term liquidity requirements, which consist primarily of maturities under long-term debt, construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities, through net cash flows provided by operating activities and our credit facilities, we intend to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which we believe will be available to us, including the issuance of Units, additional common or preferred equity, proceeds from the sale of properties, and additional long-term secured or short-term unsecured indebtedness. 

SOURCES AND USES OF CASH 

Credit markets continue to be stable, with credit availability relatively unconstrained and benchmark interest rates remaining at or near historic lows.  While to date there has been no material negative impact on our ability to borrow in our multifamily segment, we continue to monitor the roles of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) in financing multifamily properties and their general capacity to lend given allocations set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We consider that one of the consequences of a modification in the agencies  roles in recent years could potentially lead to a narrowing of their lending focus away from the smaller secondary or tertiary markets which we generally target, to multifamily properties in major metropolitan markets. We have historically obtained a significant portion of our multifamily debt from Freddie Mac, and we continue to plan to refinance portions of our maturing multifamily debt with these two entities, so any change in their ability or willingness to lend going forward could result in higher loan costs and/or more constricted availability of financing for us. Underwriting on commercial real estate continues to be more conservative compared to the underwriting standards employed prior to the recessionary period and we continue to find recourse security more frequently required, lower amounts of proceeds available and lenders limiting the amount of financing available in an effort to manage capital allocations and credit risk.  While we continue to expect to be able to refinance our debt maturing in the next twelve months without significant issues, we also expect lenders to continue to employ conservative underwriting regarding asset quality, occupancy levels and tenant creditworthiness. Accordingly, we remain cautious regarding our ability to rely on cash-out refinancing at levels we had achieved in recent years to provide funds for investment opportunities and other corporate purposes. 

As of October 31, 2016, approximately 85.7%, or $54.5 million, of our mortgage debt maturing in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017 is debt placed on multifamily assets, and approximately 14.3%, or $9.1 million, is debt placed on commercial properties. Of this $63.6 million, we expect to pay off $1.7 million and refinance $61.9 million in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. As of October 31, 2016, approximately 64.4%, or $54.5 million, of our mortgage debt maturing in the next twelve months is debt placed on multifamily assets, and approximately 35.6%, or $30.1 million, is debt placed on commercial properties.  

Our revolving, multi-bank line of credit with First International Bank as lead bank had, as of October 31, 2016, lending commitments of $100.0 million at an interest rate of 4.75%. As of October 31, 2016, the line of credit was secured by mortgages on 17 properties and had a minimum outstanding principal balance requirement of $17.5 million. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, we had borrowed $47.5 million and $17.5 million, respectively.

We maintain compensating balances, not restricted as to withdrawal, with several financial institutions in connection with financing received from those institutions and/or to ensure future credit availability. At October 31, 2016, our compensating balances totaled $14.8 million and consisted of the following: 

Current anticipated total project costs for development projects in progress at October 31, 2016 total approximately $31.8 million, of which approximately $31.4 million has been incurred as of October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership had entered into construction loans totaling approximately $22.0 million for development projects in progress. In addition to current planned expenditures for development projects in progress, as of October 31, 2016, we are committed to fund $6.0 million in tenant improvements within approximately the next 12 months.  

The issuance of Units for property acquisitions continues to be an expected source of capital for us. There were no Units issued in the three and six months ended October 31, 2016.  In the three and six months ended October 31, 2015, approximately 44,000 Units, valued at issuance at $400,000 were issued in connection with our acquisition of property.  

Under our DRIP, common shareholders and Unitholders have an opportunity to use their cash distributions to purchase additional Common Shares, and to purchase additional shares through voluntary cash contributions.   As permitted under the DRIP, starting on October 1, 2015, we changed the source from which Common Shares will be purchased under the DRIP to open market transactions, which are not eligible for purchase price discounts. During the six months ended October 31, 2016, no shares were issued under the DRIP.   During the six months ended October 31, 2015, approximately 821,000 Common Shares with a total value included in equity of $5.6 million, and an average price per share after applicable discounts of $6.85, were issued under the DRIP. 

Cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2016 totaled $68.7 million, compared to $55.1 million at October 31, 2015, an increase of $13.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended October 31, 2016 increased by $1.1 million compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to an decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable net of an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation, loss on impairment, and gain on sale of real estate investments. Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $191.8 million compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from sale of discontinued operations and payments for acquisition and development of real estate. Net cash used by financing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2016 decreased by $186.6 million compared to the six months ended October 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of Common Shares and a decrease in principal payments on mortgages payable and revolving lines of credit, net of a decrease in proceeds from mortgage debt and construction debt.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Mortgage Loan Indebtedness.   Mortgage loan indebtedness, including mortgages on properties held for sale, decreased by approximately $42,000 as of October 31, 2016, compared to April 30, 2016, due to loan payoffs. As of October 31, 2016, approximately 73.0% of our $844.6 million of mortgage debt is at fixed rates of interest, with staggered maturities. This limits our exposure to changes in interest rates, which minimizes the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows. As of October 31, 2016, the weighted average rate of interest on our mortgage debt was 4.55%, compared to 4.54% on April 30, 2016. 

Property Owned.   Property owned was $1.7 billion at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, respectively. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, we had no new acquisitions and disposed of eight properties and an unimproved parcel

of land, as described above in the  Property Acquisitions and Dispositions  subsection of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents on hand on October 31, 2016 were $68.7 million, compared to $66.7 million on April 30, 2016.  

Operating Partnership Units.   Outstanding Units in the Operating Partnership were 16.2 million Units at October 31, 2016 and 16.3 Units at April 30, 2016.  

Common and Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest.   Common Shares outstanding on October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016 totaled 121.7 million and 121.1 million, respectively. We issued approximately 492,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $1.9 million, under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan for executive officer and trustee share based compensation for future performance. We also issued approximately 59,000 Common Shares, with a total grant-date value of approximately $352,000, under our 2008 Incentive Award Plan for trustee share based compensation for fiscal year 2016 performance.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations. 

Approximately 73.0% and 77.8% of our mortgage debt, including mortgage debt related to properties held for sale, as of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, respectively, is at fixed interest rates. Therefore, we have little exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk on our existing mortgage debt. Accordingly, interest rate fluctuations during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 did not have a material effect on us. Even though our goal is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate risk, we may become vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed or variable rate debt and on future debt.  

We primarily use long-term (more than nine years) and medium term (five to seven years) debt as a source of capital. We do not currently use derivative securities, interest rate swaps or any other type of hedging activity to manage our interest rate risk.  As of October 31, 2016, we had the following amounts of future principal and interest payments due on mortgages, including mortgages held for sale, secured by our real estate: 

(1) 

Interest rate given is for the entire year.     

The weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate and variable rate debt, excluding mortgages related to assets held for sale, as of October 31, 2016, was 4.55%. Any fluctuations in variable interest rates could increase or decrease our interest expenses. For example, an increase of one percent per annum on our $185.8 million of variable rate mortgage indebtedness would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $1.9 million. 

Exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk on our $100.0 million secured line of credit is limited by a cap on the interest rate of 8.65% with a floor of 4.75%. The line of credit has an interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 1.25%, matures in September 2017 and had an outstanding balance of $47.5 million at October 31, 2016.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  :   

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2016, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  :   

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2.2   Other Purchase Agreements  .

Buyer and Seller further acknowledge that they intend for the Closing of this transaction to require the Closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements and for the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements to require the Closing of this transaction.  Buyer and Seller agree that in the event Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement for any reason as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof (other than termination as a result of (i) the willful or intentional breach or default under this Agreement by Seller or (ii) Seller's failure to remove a Financial Encumbrance as defined in Section 5.3), then such termination shall be deemed a termination of all Purchase Agreements; provided, however, Seller in its sole discretion may waive the termination of any or all Purchase Agreements and elect to proceed with the transaction pursuant to the remaining terms and conditions of such Purchase Agreement(s). 

Section 3  .    Earnest Money  .   

3.1  Deposit and Disposition.    Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is depositing with Closing Agent the cash sum of Two Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Six Hundred Fourteen and 07/100 Dollars ($224,614.07) (the    Earnest Money   ).  If this Agreement is not terminated by Buyer before the Inspection Date (as defined in Section 6.3), Buyer shall increase the Earnest Money by depositing an additional Three Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty-One and 11/100 Dollars ($336,921.11) with Closing Agent within two (2) business days after the Inspection Date.  The Earnest Money shall be held by Closing Agent until disbursed as set forth in this Agreement.  Buyer shall execute and deliver any appropriate W-9 forms requested by Closing Agent.  If and only if (a) Buyer acquires the Property, and (b) the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall be paid to Seller and applied as a credit against the Consideration.  If the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is not the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall not be applied as a credit against the Consideration in this transaction, but shall rather be applied as a credit against the consideration of such final closing.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement are not met or resolved, or if Buyer terminates this Agreement as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof, then Closing Agent shall return the Earnest Money to Buyer, subject to Section 3.3 below.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Buyer, and if thereafter Buyer fails to acquire the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Earnest Money shall be delivered to Seller and shall be retained by Seller as liquidated damages.  If there is a dispute between Buyer and Seller as to the distribution of the Earnest Money, or if for any other reason Closing Agent in good faith elects not to make any such disbursement, then Closing Agent shall continue to hold the Earnest Money until otherwise directed by written instructions executed both by Seller and Buyer, or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Upon request, Buyer and Seller shall execute Closing Agent s standard earnest money escrow agreement; provided, however, that if there is any conflict or inconsistency between such escrow agreement and this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control.  

3.2                Investments  .  Following the collection of the Earnest Money, Closing Agent shall, at the written request of Buyer, invest the Earnest Money in:  (a) obligations of the United States government, its   

4 

agencies or independent departments; (b) certificates of deposit issued by a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship; or (c) either a non-interest bearing account providing F.D.I.C. insurance in the full amount of the Earnest Money, or an interest-bearing account at a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion, and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship.        No investment of the Earnest Money shall have a maturity date beyond the Closing Date. 

3.3   Non-Refundable Earnest Money  .  Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be non-refundable to Buyer in accordance with the following schedule:   

Section 4  .    Consideration and Prorations  . 

4.1      Consideration  .  The    Consideration    shall be the sum of Fifty-three Million and 00/100 Dollars ($53,000,000.00), which purchase price shall be allocated to each individual Property as set forth in   Exhibit 4.1   attached hereto.    The parties shall make the prorations and allocations set forth in this section as a credit or debit to the Consideration.  The balance of the Consideration shall be paid by Buyer to Escrow Agent, to be released to Seller at Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by not later than 12:00 p.m. Central Time. 

4.2      Prorations  . 

(a) 

General  .  For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled to the income therefrom and responsible for the expenses thereof, for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs.  All prorations shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days of the year and month that shall have elapsed prior to the Closing Date.     

(b) 

Rent  .  The parties shall Prorate all Rent actually received by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs.  At Closing, to the extent actually received by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer any and all prepaid Rent relating or pertaining to the Property.  If Seller receives payment for Rent after Closing, Seller shall immediately pay to Buyer the portion of such payment which relates to the period on and after the Closing Date, and any portion of such payment which relates to the period prior to Closing which was credited to Seller at Closing.  If this transaction Closes, percentage rent under the Lease for the year 2016 (if any) shall accrue through October 31, 2016 and shall be paid to Seller at Closing; provided that Buyer shall provide to Seller all information and documents necessary to calculate any such percentage rent no later than December 15, 2016, with such calculation to be an amount mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer prior to Closing.     

5 

(c) 

Taxes  .  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Lease, Tenant is obligated to reimburse Seller as landlord for all Taxes and installments of special assessments of the Property.  Seller shall not provide a credit to Buyer at Closing for any proration of Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year, unless Seller has collected money under the Lease for Taxes and has not paid a corresponding amount to the relevant taxing authority.  Buyer shall provide a credit to Seller for any Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year that Seller as landlord has paid which are the responsibilities of Tenant pursuant to the Lease and Tenant has not yet reimbursed to Seller as landlord in accordance with the Lease.  Buyer shall pay all Taxes and installments of special assessments due and payable in the Closing Year and for years prior to the Closing Year, if any remain outstanding, and shall upon request furnish evidence of such payment to Title Company.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for all remaining future Taxes and installments of any special assessments.  Real property tax refunds and credits received after the Closing shall belong to Buyer.       

(d) 

Operating Expenses  .  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Lease, Tenant is obligated to pay all Operating Expenses of the Property.  The parties shall not provide any credit for the proration of such Operating Expenses.  Buyer shall ensure that Tenant pays all utility charges for the Property through the Closing Date.  Commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay all utility charges for the Property (excluding any utilities held in the name of Tenant).     

(e) 

Tenant Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, if Tenant is obligated under the Lease to directly pay any Operating Expenses (including without limitation Taxes), then said items will not be prorated between the parties.     

(f) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.     

(g) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Tenant for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.     

4.3   Contingent Payment.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the Properties are sold by Buyer within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Consideration allocated to such Property.  The Deeds shall contain a deed restriction granting Seller the right to receive such additional sum from Buyer. 

6 

Section 5  .      Title and Survey. 

5.1  Title Commitments  .  As soon as reasonably possible after the Contract Date, Seller shall coordinate the Title Company s delivery to Buyer of the Title Commitments, in the amount of the Consideration.  The Title Commitments shall show the condition of title to the Land and Improvements, shall name Buyer as the proposed insured, and shall include legible copies of all recorded exceptions and covenants, conditions, easements, and restrictions affecting the Property.  The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.   

5.2  New Survey  .  Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as part of the Due Diligence Documents, a copy of the most recent surveys of the Property in Seller s possession (the    Existing Survey   ).  In the event Buyer commissions new surveys of the Property (the    New Survey   ), then Seller shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer regarding the preparation of the New Surveys.  Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the New Surveys.  The New Surveys shall be certified to Seller, Buyer, and the Title Company.  Seller shall receive a signed original of the final New Surveys as soon as it is available and in any event, at or prior to Closing. 

5.3  Title Notice  .  If the Title Commitments or Existing Surveys disclose matters that are not acceptable to Buyer (   Unpermitted Exceptions   ), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the    Title Notice   ) of Buyer s objections within the later of (i) ten (10) days after Buyer has received both the Title Commitments and the Existing Surveys, or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the Inspection Date (the    Objection Period   ).  Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller has declined to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for any elections allowed or required by this Section. 

5.4  Pre-Closing  Gap  Title Obligations.    Buyer may, at or prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing (the    Gap Notice   ) of any objections to title raised by the Title Company after Buyer s receipt of the initial Title Commitments, or of any material defect shown on the New Surveys that was not disclosed on the Existing Surveys; provided that Buyer must notify the Seller of such objection to title within ten (10) days of being made aware of the existence of any such new objection.  If Buyer sends a Gap Notice to the   

7 

Seller, Buyer and the Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section 5.3 hereof. 

Section 6  .    Buyer s Inspection  . 

6.1      Document Inspection  .  Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Buyer (by itself or through such agents, consultants and others as Buyer shall designate) may inspect, test and analyze the Property (provided that any inspections or testing of the Land or Improvements shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.2 below).  Seller will, within twenty  (20) days after the Contract Date, deliver to Buyer complete copies of the Due Diligence Documents set forth on   Exhibit 2  .  In addition to the Due Diligence Documents, Seller will make available for Buyer's inspection any appraisals with respect to the Property; provided, however, that said appraisals are subject to confidentiality and are limited to use for mortgage lending sources only.  Buyer hereby agrees that said appraisals shall not be distributed to financing sources other than regulated financial service companies relying on the contents of such appraisals in order to provide mortgage debt. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and understands that some of the materials delivered by Seller have been prepared by parties other than Seller or Seller's current property manager.  Seller makes no representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, as to the completeness, content, or accuracy of any delivered materials. 

6.2      Physical Inspection  .

All of the foregoing shall be without limitation upon the rights and remedies of Seller hereunder, at law or in equity, in the event of a default by Buyer pursuant to Sections 6.2, 6.5, 8, 12.3, or 17.3, or pursuant to any covenant, agreement, indemnity, representation or warranty of Buyer that survives the Closing or the termination of this Agreement.        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, IF BUYER BRINGS AN ACTION AGAINST SELLER FOR AN ALLEGED BREACH OR DEFAULT BY SELLER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, RECORDS A LIS PENDENS OR OTHERWISE ENJOINS OR RESTRICTS SELLER S ABILITY TO SELL AND TRANSFER THE PROPERTY OR REFUSES TO CONSENT TO OR INSTRUCT RELEASE OF THE EARNEST MONEY TO SELLER IF REQUIRED BY CLOSING AGENT (EACH A    BUYER S ACTION   ), SELLER SHALL NOT BE RESTRICTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION FROM BRINGING AN ACTION AGAINST BUYER SEEKING EXPUNGEMENT OR RELIEF FROM ANY IMPROPERLY FILED LIS PENDENS, INJUNCTION OR OTHER RESTRAINT, AND/OR RECOVERING FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS  FEES) WHICH SELLER MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF ANY BUYER S ACTION BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT SELLER IS THE PREVAILING PARTY; AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES AWARDED TO SELLER SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL, HOWEVER, BE DEEMED TO LIMIT BUYER S LIABILITY TO SELLER FOR DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR BREACH OF BUYER S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR FOR ATTORNEYS  FEES AND COSTS AS PROVIDED BELOW.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE   

19 

FOREGOING, BUYER MAY FILE A LIS PENDENS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PRESERVE A CLAIM FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. 

12.3  Attorneys  Fees to Prevailing Party.    In the event of any litigation between the parties hereto under any of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party to such litigation agrees to pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the prevailing party in such litigation.  The parties agree that the court presiding over the litigation shall determine whether a party is a  prevailing party,  and shall determine the reasonable amount of attorney s fees and costs recoverable.  The parties agree that the amount of attorneys  fees and costs which may be awarded must bear a reasonable relationship to, and must be limited by the court to a reasonable amount in view of, the amount recovered by the prevailing party in such matter. 

12.4    Cross-Default  .  A default by either party under any other Purchase Agreement or the Purchase Agreements shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under this Agreement and a default by either party under this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under the other Purchase Agreements.     

Section 13.  Condemnation  .  If, between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings are initiated or threatened that might result in the taking of any part of the Improvements or the Land or access to the Land from adjacent roadways, then Buyer at its sole discretion may elect to terminate this Agreement without cost, obligation, or liability on the part of Buyer, in which event this Agreement shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease and the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3.  If this Agreement is not terminated, then Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any award pertaining to the Property made in connection with such condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of written notice from Seller of such condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, whether it elects to exercise its right to terminate.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election. 

Section 14.    Damage or Destruction  .  Seller shall bear all risk of loss to the Property until the Closing Date.  If, between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty and the cost to repair and restore the Property is more than $2,500,000.00, then Buyer at its sole discretion may elect to terminate this Agreement without cost, obligation, or liability on Buyer s part, in which event all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease and the Earnest Money will be returned to Buyer irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3.  If either this Agreement is not terminable in accordance with the foregoing, or is terminable but is not terminated, then Seller shall, upon Closing, assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any insurance proceeds, including without limitation any rent loss insurance proceeds (except for proceeds for rent losses prior to Closing), payable as a result of such damage or destruction, plus Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any deductible losses under such insurance policies and at Closing shall have no further repair or restoration obligations.  Seller shall advise Buyer regarding the insurance policies covering such damage or destruction and the probable amount of any insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from Seller of such damage or destruction of its election.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election.

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

16.2.   
			 Change of Conditions  .  Buyer shall accept the Property at Closing in the same condition as the Property is as of the Contract Date, as such condition shall have changed by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration and, subject to Sections 14 and 15 hereof, condemnation or damage by fire or other casualty.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present condition, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to complete closing under this Agreement and pay the full Consideration.

17.3.   
			 Brokers  .  Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that such representing and warranting party has not employed or made any commitment to a broker or agent (including without limitation any real estate or securities broker, agent, dealer, or salesperson) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, except for Buyer s Broker and Seller s Broker.  Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from any loss or cost suffered or incurred by it as a result of the indemnifying parties  representation herein being untrue.

Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Property, and no representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein or incorporated herein by reference shall be of any force or effect.

17.10.   
			 Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.     

17.11.   
			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .  This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and is intended, and shall for all purposes be deemed to be, a single, integrated document setting forth all of the agreements and understandings of the parties hereto, and superseding all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements of such parties.  If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any provision contained herein shall be cancelled or merged with any deed or other instrument on, as of, at or by reason of the Closing, and the covenants and obligations of the parties shall survive the Closing.

Closing Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money shall be to hold, in trust, the Earnest Money and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Earnest Money and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Earnest Money and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Earnest Money or for any diminution in value of the Earnest Money from any cause, other than Closing Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Closing Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Buyer, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Closing Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Closing Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Closing Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Closing Agent.  

18.2    Disputes  .  Closing Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Earnest Money.  If, after the Inspection Date, there is any dispute as to whether Closing Agent is obligated to deliver the Earnest Money or as to whom the Earnest Money is to be delivered, Closing Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Earnest Money until receipt by Closing Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Earnest Money, or, in the absence of authorization, Closing Agent shall hold the Earnest Money until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.  Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic.  If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within 30 days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Closing Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Earnest Money with a court of the State of Colorado pending a determination.  Closing Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Closing Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Earnest Money.  Upon making delivery of the Earnest Money in the manner provided in this Agreement, Closing Agent shall have no further liability hereunder.  In no event shall Closing Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Buyer in connection with the Earnest Money.  

18.3    Reports  .  Closing Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  This provision shall survive the Closing.

If there is a dispute between Buyer and Seller as to the distribution of the Earnest Money, or if for any other reason Closing Agent in good faith elects not to make any such disbursement, then Closing Agent shall continue to hold the Earnest Money until otherwise directed by written instructions executed both by Seller and Buyer, or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Seller shall not provide a credit to Buyer at Closing for any proration of Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year, unless Seller has collected money under the Leases for Taxes and has not paid a corresponding amount to the relevant taxing authority.  Buyer shall provide a credit to Seller for any Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year that Seller as landlord has paid which are the responsibilities of Tenant pursuant to the Leases and Tenant has not yet reimbursed to Seller as landlord in accordance with the Leases.

(e) 

Tenant Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, if Tenant is obligated under the Leases to directly pay any Operating Expenses (including without limitation Taxes), then said items will not be prorated between the parties.     

(f) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.     

(g) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no      

6 

event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Tenant for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.

The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.   

5.2  New Survey  .  Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as part of the Due Diligence Documents, a copy of the most recent surveys of the Property in Seller s possession (the    Existing Survey   ).  In the event Buyer commissions new surveys of the Property (the    New Survey   ), then Seller shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer regarding the preparation of the New Surveys.  Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the New Surveys.  The New Surveys shall be certified to Seller, Buyer, and the Title Company.  Seller shall receive a signed original of the final New Surveys as soon as it is available and in any event, at or prior to Closing. 

5.3  Title Notice  .  If the Title Commitments or Existing Surveys disclose matters that are not acceptable to Buyer (   Unpermitted Exceptions   ), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the    Title Notice   ) of Buyer s objections within the later of (i) ten (10) days after Buyer has received both the Title Commitments and the Existing Surveys, or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the Inspection Date (the    Objection Period   ).  Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or   

7 

otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller has declined to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for any elections allowed or required by this Section. 

5.4  Pre-Closing  Gap  Title Obligations.    Buyer may, at or prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing (the    Gap Notice   ) of any objections to title raised by the Title Company after Buyer s receipt of the initial Title Commitments, or of any material defect shown on the New Surveys that was not disclosed on the Existing Surveys; provided that Buyer must notify the Seller of such objection to title within ten (10) days of being made aware of the existence of any such new objection.  If Buyer sends a Gap Notice to the Seller, Buyer and the Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section 5.3 hereof. 

Section 6  .    Buyer s Inspection  .

Prior to performing any environmental investigation of the Property (other than a Phase I environmental site assessment), Buyer shall notify Seller of the name of the environmental consultant that will conduct the investigation.  Buyer shall not have the right to disturb the soil at the Property, or to perform any destructive or invasive testing, without Seller s prior written consent.

All of the foregoing shall be without limitation upon the rights and remedies of Seller hereunder, at law or in equity, in the event of a default by Buyer pursuant to Sections 6.2, 6.5, 8, 12.3, or 17.3, or pursuant to any covenant, agreement, indemnity, representation or warranty of Buyer that survives the Closing or the termination of this Agreement.        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, IF BUYER BRINGS AN ACTION AGAINST SELLER FOR AN ALLEGED BREACH OR DEFAULT BY SELLER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, RECORDS A LIS PENDENS OR OTHERWISE ENJOINS OR RESTRICTS SELLER S ABILITY TO SELL AND TRANSFER THE PROPERTY OR REFUSES TO CONSENT TO OR INSTRUCT RELEASE OF THE EARNEST MONEY TO SELLER IF REQUIRED BY CLOSING AGENT (EACH A    BUYER S ACTION   ), SELLER SHALL NOT BE RESTRICTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION

NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL, HOWEVER, BE DEEMED TO LIMIT BUYER S LIABILITY TO SELLER FOR DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR BREACH OF BUYER S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR FOR ATTORNEYS  FEES AND COSTS AS PROVIDED BELOW.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, BUYER MAY FILE A LIS PENDENS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PRESERVE A CLAIM FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.

The parties agree that the court presiding over the litigation shall determine whether a party is a  prevailing party,  and shall determine the reasonable amount of attorney s fees and costs recoverable.  The parties agree that the amount of attorneys  fees and costs which may be awarded must bear a reasonable relationship to, and must be limited by the court to a reasonable amount in view of, the amount recovered by the prevailing party in such matter. 

12.4    Cross-Default  .  A default by either party under any other Purchase Agreement or the Purchase Agreements shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under this Agreement and a default by either party under this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under the other Purchase Agreements.     

Section 13.  Condemnation  .  If, between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings are initiated or threatened that might result in the taking of any part of the Improvements or the Land or access to the Land from adjacent roadways, then Buyer at its sole discretion may elect to terminate this Agreement without cost, obligation, or liability on the part of Buyer, in which event this Agreement shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease and the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3.  If this Agreement is not terminated, then Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any award pertaining to the Property made in connection with such condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of written notice from Seller of such condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, whether it elects to exercise its right to terminate.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election. 

Section 14.    Damage or Destruction  .  Seller shall bear all risk of loss to the Property until the Closing Date.

If either this Agreement is not terminable in accordance with the foregoing, or is terminable but is not terminated, then Seller shall, upon Closing, assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any insurance proceeds, including without limitation any rent loss insurance proceeds (except for proceeds for rent losses prior to Closing), payable as a result of   

20 

such damage or destruction, plus Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any deductible losses under such insurance policies and at Closing shall have no further repair or restoration obligations.  Seller shall advise Buyer regarding the insurance policies covering such damage or destruction and the probable amount of any insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from Seller of such damage or destruction of its election.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election.

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

16.2.   
			 Change of Conditions  .

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present      

22

17.3.   
			 Brokers  .  Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that such representing and warranting party has not employed or made any commitment to a broker or agent (including without limitation any real estate or securities broker, agent, dealer, or salesperson) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, except for Buyer s Broker and Seller s Broker.

Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .

17.10.   
			 Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.     

17.11.   
			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .

If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .

25 

CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ANY ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY MANNER WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED BY THE OTHER PARTY AT CLOSING, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  Each party hereby authorizes and empowers the other to file this Section and this Agreement with the clerk or judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a written consent to waiver of jury trial.     

Section 18.  Closing Agent Duties and Disputes  .  

18.1    Other Duties of Closing Agent  .  Closing Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Buyer, whether or not Closing Agent has knowledge thereof.  Closing Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money shall be to hold, in trust, the Earnest Money and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Earnest Money and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Earnest Money and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Earnest Money or for any diminution in value of the Earnest Money from any cause, other than Closing Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Closing Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Buyer, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Closing Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Closing Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Closing Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Closing Agent.  

18.2    Disputes  .  Closing Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Earnest Money.  If, after the Inspection Date, there is any dispute as to whether Closing Agent is obligated to deliver the Earnest Money or as to whom the Earnest Money is to be delivered, Closing Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Earnest Money until receipt by Closing Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Earnest Money, or, in the absence of authorization, Closing Agent shall hold the Earnest Money until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.

Rent  .  The parties shall Prorate all Rent actually received by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs.  At Closing, to the extent actually received by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer any and all prepaid Rent relating or pertaining to the Property.  If Seller receives payment for Rent after Closing, Seller shall immediately pay to Buyer the portion of such payment which relates to the period on and after the Closing Date, and any portion of such payment which relates to the period prior to Closing which was credited to Seller at Closing.  Annual Rent increases pursuant to the Leases are to be paid through the day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that if this transaction Closes, Buyer will receive a Rent credit at Closing equal to the annual Rent increases beginning November 1, 2016 through the day preceding the Closing Date, which the parties shall Prorate for the month in which Closing occurs.

Buyer shall provide a credit to Seller for any Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year that Seller as landlord has paid which are the responsibilities of Tenant pursuant to the Leases and Tenant has not yet reimbursed to Seller as landlord in accordance with the Leases.  Buyer shall pay all Taxes and installments of special assessments due and payable in the Closing Year and for years prior to the Closing Year, if any remain outstanding, and shall upon request furnish evidence of such payment to Title Company.

(f) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.     

(g) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Tenant for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.

The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.

Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller has declined to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure.

In no event shall the aggregate liability of Seller to Buyer by reason of a breach or default of one or more of Seller's representations exceed three percent (3%) of the Consideration for the entire portfolio contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchase Agreements; provided, however, if such claim relates to a breach relating to an individual Property, Seller's liability shall not exceed the amount that is the allocated purchase price of such Property as set forth on   Exhibit 4.1  .  Seller's liability shall be limited to actual damages and shall not include consequential, special or punitive damages.

Any proceeding or litigation based upon a claim of fraud, misrepresentation or similar theory shall be commenced by Buyer within fifteen (15) months of the Closing Date and, if appropriate proceedings are not commenced within such time period, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any such claim.

In the event the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon a Closing Date other than January 18, 2017, then the Closing Date shall be April 28, 2017.  If Closing has not occurred by April 28, 2017, for any reason other than Seller s material default under this Agreement, then Seller in its sole discretion may at any time thereafter terminate this Agreement and retain any portion of the Earnest Money to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement.

Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of written notice from Seller of such condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, whether it elects to exercise its right to terminate.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.

If either this Agreement is not terminable in accordance with the foregoing, or is terminable but is not terminated, then Seller shall, upon Closing, assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any insurance proceeds, including without limitation any rent loss insurance proceeds (except for proceeds for rent losses prior to Closing), payable as a result of such damage or destruction, plus Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any deductible losses under such insurance policies and at Closing shall have no further repair or restoration obligations.  Seller shall advise Buyer regarding the insurance policies covering such damage or destruction and the probable amount of any insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from Seller of such damage or destruction of its election.

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present condition, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to complete closing under this Agreement and pay the full Consideration.  Seller has no obligation to make any repairs or replacements required by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or condemnation or fire or other casualty, but may, at its option and its cost (including the use of insurance proceeds as herein provided), make any such repairs and replacements prior to the Closing Date.

16.4.   
			 Release  .

THE RELEASE SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1) OR UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS ANY OF THOSE LAWS MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME AND ANY REGULATIONS, ORDERS, RULES OF PROCEDURES OR GUIDELINES PROMULGATED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH LAWS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE IN EXISTENCE ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Property, and no representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein or incorporated herein by reference shall be of any force or effect.

			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .  This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and is intended, and shall for all purposes be deemed to be, a single, integrated document setting forth all of the agreements and understandings of the parties hereto, and superseding all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements of such parties.  If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any provision contained herein shall be cancelled or merged with any deed or other instrument on, as of, at or by reason of the Closing, and the covenants and obligations of the parties shall survive the Closing.

			           Waiver of Jury Trial  .  BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ANY ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY MANNER WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS      

25 

A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED BY THE OTHER PARTY AT CLOSING, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  Each party hereby authorizes and empowers the other to file this Section and this Agreement with the clerk or judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a written consent to waiver of jury trial.     

Section 18.  Closing Agent Duties and Disputes  .  

18.1    Other Duties of Closing Agent  .  Closing Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Buyer, whether or not Closing Agent has knowledge thereof.  Closing Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money shall be to hold, in trust, the Earnest Money and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Earnest Money and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Earnest Money and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Earnest Money or for any diminution in value of the Earnest Money from any cause, other than Closing Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Closing Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Buyer, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Closing Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Closing Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Closing Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Closing Agent.  

18.2    Disputes  .  Closing Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Earnest Money.  If, after the Inspection Date, there is any dispute as to whether Closing Agent is obligated to deliver the Earnest Money or as to whom the Earnest Money is to be delivered, Closing Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Earnest Money until receipt by Closing Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Earnest Money, or, in the absence of authorization, Closing Agent shall hold the Earnest Money until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.  Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic.  If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within 30 days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Closing Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Earnest Money with a court of the State of Colorado pending a determination.  Closing Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Closing Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Earnest Money.  Upon making delivery of the Earnest Money in the manner provided in this Agreement, Closing Agent shall have no further liability hereunder.  In no event shall Closing Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Buyer in connection with the Earnest Money.  

18.3    Reports  .  Closing Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  This provision shall survive the Closing.

Buyer and Seller further acknowledge that they intend for the Closing of this transaction to require the Closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements and for the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements to require the Closing of this transaction.  Buyer and Seller agree that in the event Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement for any reason as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof (other than termination as a result of (i) the willful or intentional breach or default under this Agreement by Seller or (ii) Seller's failure to remove a Financial Encumbrance as defined in Section 5.3), then such termination shall be deemed a termination of all Purchase Agreements; provided, however, Seller in its sole discretion may waive the termination of any or all Purchase Agreements and elect to proceed with the transaction pursuant to the remaining terms and conditions of such Purchase Agreement(s). 

Section 3  .    Earnest Money  .   

3.1  Deposit and Disposition.    Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is depositing with Closing Agent the cash sum of Three Hundred One Thousand Fifty-four and 91/100 Dollars ($301,054.91) (the    Earnest Money   ).  If this Agreement is not terminated by Buyer before the Inspection Date (as defined in Section 6.3), Buyer shall increase the Earnest Money by depositing an additional Four Hundred Fifty-one Thousand Five Hundred Eighty-two and 36/100 Dollars ($451,582.36) with Closing Agent within two (2) business days after the Inspection Date.  The Earnest Money shall be held by Closing Agent until disbursed as set forth in this Agreement.  Buyer shall execute and deliver any appropriate W-9 forms requested by Closing Agent.  If and only if (a) Buyer acquires the Property, and (b) the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall be paid to Seller and applied as a credit against the Consideration.  If the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is not the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall not be applied as a credit against the Consideration in this transaction, but shall rather be applied as a credit against the consideration of such final closing.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement are not met or resolved, or if Buyer terminates this Agreement as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof, then Closing Agent shall return the Earnest Money to Buyer, subject to Section 3.3 below.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Buyer, and if thereafter Buyer fails to acquire the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Earnest Money shall be delivered to Seller and shall be retained by Seller as liquidated damages.  If there is a dispute between Buyer and Seller as to the distribution of the Earnest Money, or if for any other reason Closing Agent in good faith elects not to make any such disbursement, then Closing Agent shall continue to hold the Earnest Money until otherwise directed by written instructions executed both by Seller and Buyer, or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Upon request, Buyer and Seller shall execute Closing Agent s standard earnest money escrow agreement; provided, however, that if there is any conflict or inconsistency between such escrow agreement and this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control.  

3.2                Investments  .  Following the collection of the Earnest Money, Closing Agent shall, at the written request of Buyer, invest the Earnest Money in:  (a) obligations of the United States government, its agencies or independent departments; (b) certificates of deposit issued by a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship; or (c) either a   

4 

non-interest bearing account providing F.D.I.C. insurance in the full amount of the Earnest Money, or an interest-bearing account at a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion, and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship.        No investment of the Earnest Money shall have a maturity date beyond the Closing Date. 

3.3   Non-Refundable Earnest Money  .  Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be non-refundable to Buyer in accordance with the following schedule:   

Section 4  .    Consideration and Prorations  . 

4.1      Consideration  .  The    Consideration    shall be the sum of Seventy-one Million Thirty-seven Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($71,037,000.00), which purchase price shall be allocated to each individual Property as set forth in   Exhibit 4.1   attached hereto.  The parties shall make the prorations and allocations set forth in this section as a credit or debit to the Consideration.  The balance of the Consideration shall be paid by Buyer to Escrow Agent, to be released to Seller at Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by not later than 12:00 p.m. Central Time. 

4.2      Prorations  . 

(a) 

General  .  For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled to the income therefrom and responsible for the expenses thereof, for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs.  All prorations shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days of the year and month that shall have elapsed prior to the Closing Date.     

(b) 

Rent  .  The parties shall Prorate all Rent actually received by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs.  At Closing, to the extent actually received by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer any and all prepaid Rent relating or pertaining to the Property.  If Seller receives payment for Rent after Closing, Seller shall immediately pay to Buyer the portion of such payment which relates to the period on and after the Closing Date, and any portion of such payment which relates to the period prior to Closing which was credited to Seller at Closing.  Annual Rent increases pursuant to the Leases are to be paid through the day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that if this transaction Closes, Buyer will receive a Rent credit at Closing equal to the annual Rent increases beginning November 1, 2016 through the day preceding the Closing Date, which the parties shall Prorate for the month in which Closing occurs.  Any Capital Expenditures Obligation (as defined in the Leases) of Seller, as landlord, pursuant to the Leases with respect to an annual $350 per unit allowance toward payment or reimbursement of Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Leases) made by Tenant shall be paid by Seller through December 31, 2016, with any unused portion on any Property for the year 2016 to be applied as a credit to the      

5 

Consideration allocated for that Property at Closing.  If this transaction Closes, percentage rent under the Leases for the year 2016 (if any) shall accrue through October 31, 2016 and shall be paid to Seller at Closing; provided that Buyer shall provide to Seller all information and documents necessary to calculate any such percentage rent no later than December 15, 2016, with such calculation to be an amount mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer prior to Closing.     

(c) 

Taxes  .  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Leases, Tenant is obligated to reimburse Seller as landlord for all Taxes and installments of special assessments of the Property.  Seller shall not provide a credit to Buyer at Closing for any proration of Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year, unless Seller has collected money under the Leases for Taxes and has not paid a corresponding amount to the relevant taxing authority.  Buyer shall provide a credit to Seller for any Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year that Seller as landlord has paid which are the responsibilities of Tenant pursuant to the Leases and Tenant has not yet reimbursed to Seller as landlord in accordance with the Leases.  Buyer shall pay all Taxes and installments of special assessments due and payable in the Closing Year and for years prior to the Closing Year, if any remain outstanding, and shall upon request furnish evidence of such payment to Title Company.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for all remaining future Taxes and installments of any special assessments.  Real property tax refunds and credits received after the Closing shall belong to Buyer.       

(d) 

Operating Expenses  .  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Leases, Tenant is obligated to pay all Operating Expenses of the Property.  The parties shall not provide any credit for the proration of such Operating Expenses.  Buyer shall ensure that Tenant pays all utility charges for the Property through the Closing Date.  Commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay all utility charges for the Property (excluding any utilities held in the name of Tenant).     

(e) 

Tenant Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, if Tenant is obligated under the Leases to directly pay any Operating Expenses (including without limitation Taxes), then said items will not be prorated between the parties.     

(f) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.     

(g) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Tenant for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and      

6 

Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.     

4.3   Contingent Payment.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the Properties are sold by Buyer within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Consideration allocated to such Property.  The Deeds shall contain a deed restriction granting Seller the right to receive such additional sum from Buyer. 

Section 5  .      Title and Survey. 

5.1  Title Commitments  .  As soon as reasonably possible after the Contract Date, Seller shall coordinate the Title Company s delivery to Buyer of the Title Commitments, in the amount of the Consideration.  The Title Commitments shall show the condition of title to the Land and Improvements, shall name Buyer as the proposed insured, and shall include legible copies of all recorded exceptions and covenants, conditions, easements, and restrictions affecting the Property.  The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.   

5.2  New Survey  .  Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as part of the Due Diligence Documents, a copy of the most recent surveys of the Property in Seller s possession (the    Existing Survey   ).  In the event Buyer commissions new surveys of the Property (the    New Survey   ), then Seller shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer regarding the preparation of the New Surveys.  Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the New Surveys.  The New Surveys shall be certified to Seller, Buyer, and the Title Company.  Seller shall receive a signed original of the final New Surveys as soon as it is available and in any event, at or prior to Closing. 

5.3  Title Notice  .  If the Title Commitments or Existing Surveys disclose matters that are not acceptable to Buyer (   Unpermitted Exceptions   ), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the    Title Notice   ) of Buyer s objections within the later of (i) ten (10) days after Buyer has received both the Title Commitments and the Existing Surveys, or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the Inspection Date (the    Objection Period   ).  Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller   

7 

has declined to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for any elections allowed or required by this Section. 

5.4  Pre-Closing  Gap  Title Obligations.    Buyer may, at or prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing (the    Gap Notice   ) of any objections to title raised by the Title Company after Buyer s receipt of the initial Title Commitments, or of any material defect shown on the New Surveys that was not disclosed on the Existing Surveys; provided that Buyer must notify the Seller of such objection to title within ten (10) days of being made aware of the existence of any such new objection.  If Buyer sends a Gap Notice to the Seller, Buyer and the Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section 5.3 hereof. 

Section 6  .    Buyer s Inspection  . 

6.1      Document Inspection  .  Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Buyer (by itself or through such agents, consultants and others as Buyer shall designate) may inspect, test and analyze the Property (provided that any inspections or testing of the Land or Improvements shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.2 below).  Seller will, within twenty  (20) days after the Contract Date, deliver to Buyer complete copies of the Due Diligence Documents set forth on   Exhibit 2  .  In addition to the Due Diligence Documents, Seller will make available for Buyer's inspection any appraisals with respect to the Property; provided, however, that said appraisals are subject to confidentiality and are limited to use for mortgage lending sources only.  Buyer hereby agrees that said appraisals shall not be distributed to financing sources other than regulated financial service companies relying on the contents of such appraisals in order to provide mortgage debt. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and understands that some of the materials delivered by Seller have been prepared by parties other than Seller or Seller's current property manager.  Seller makes no representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, as to the completeness, content, or accuracy of any delivered materials. 

6.2      Physical Inspection  .  Buyer and its consultants and agents shall have the right, from time to time prior to the earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement, to enter upon the Property to examine the same and the condition thereof, and to conduct such investigations, inspections, tests and studies as Buyer shall determine to be reasonably necessary.  Buyer agrees to conduct such activities during normal business hours to the extent practicable.  Buyer agrees to pay all costs of such investigations, inspections, tests and studies and to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any claims for injury or death to persons or damage to property arising out of any action of any person or firm entering the Property on Buyer s behalf as aforesaid (  provided   that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing indemnity shall not be applicable if such claims arise from or are in connection with any such damages to the extent resulting from a pre-existing condition, unless exacerbated or adversely affected by Buyer or any of its employees, consultants, agents, prospective lenders (and their consultants) or representatives, and, in such case, only to the extent so exacerbated), which indemnity shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement without the Closing having occurred.  Prior to performing any environmental investigation of the Property (other than a Phase I environmental site assessment), Buyer shall notify Seller of the name of the environmental consultant that will conduct the investigation.  Buyer shall not have the right to disturb the soil at the Property, or to perform any destructive or invasive testing, without Seller s prior written consent.  In requesting any such consent, Buyer shall provide Seller with a proposed written work plan describing the investigation, the name of the contractor that will perform the investigation, evidence of insurance coverage for the contractor, and in the case of soil testing a site plan showing where the soil will be disturbed.

Seller shall have no other remedy for any pre-Closing default by Buyer, including any right to damages.  BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:  (1) THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF AND BEARS A REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DAMAGES THAT WOULD BE SUFFERED AND COSTS INCURRED BY SELLER AS A RESULT OF HAVING WITHDRAWN THE PROPERTY FROM SALE AND THE FAILURE OF CLOSING TO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO A DEFAULT OF BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; (2) THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUFFERED AND COSTS INCURRED BY SELLER AS A RESULT OF SUCH WITHDRAWAL AND FAILURE TO CLOSE DUE TO A DEFAULT OF BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL TO DETERMINE; (3) BUYER SEEKS TO LIMIT ITS LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY IN THE EVENT THIS AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED AND THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CLOSE DUE TO A DEFAULT OF BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; AND (4) THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY SHALL BE AND DOES CONSTITUTE VALID LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.  All of the foregoing shall be without limitation upon the rights and remedies of Seller hereunder, at law or in equity, in the event of a default by Buyer pursuant to Sections 6.2, 6.5, 8, 12.3, or 17.3, or pursuant to any covenant, agreement, indemnity, representation or warranty of Buyer that survives the Closing or the termination of this Agreement.        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, IF BUYER BRINGS AN ACTION AGAINST SELLER FOR AN ALLEGED BREACH OR DEFAULT BY SELLER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, RECORDS A LIS PENDENS OR OTHERWISE ENJOINS OR RESTRICTS SELLER S ABILITY TO SELL AND TRANSFER THE PROPERTY OR REFUSES TO CONSENT TO OR INSTRUCT RELEASE OF THE EARNEST MONEY TO SELLER IF REQUIRED BY CLOSING AGENT (EACH A    BUYER S ACTION   ), SELLER SHALL NOT BE RESTRICTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION FROM BRINGING AN ACTION AGAINST BUYER SEEKING EXPUNGEMENT OR RELIEF FROM ANY IMPROPERLY FILED LIS PENDENS, INJUNCTION OR OTHER RESTRAINT, AND/OR RECOVERING FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS  FEES) WHICH SELLER MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF ANY BUYER S ACTION BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT SELLER IS THE PREVAILING PARTY; AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES AWARDED TO SELLER SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL, HOWEVER, BE DEEMED TO LIMIT BUYER S LIABILITY TO SELLER FOR DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR BREACH OF BUYER S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR FOR ATTORNEYS  FEES AND COSTS AS PROVIDED BELOW.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE   

19 

FOREGOING, BUYER MAY FILE A LIS PENDENS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PRESERVE A CLAIM FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.

The parties agree that the court presiding over the litigation shall determine whether a party is a  prevailing party,  and shall determine the reasonable amount of attorney s fees and costs recoverable.  The parties agree that the amount of attorneys  fees and costs which may be awarded must bear a reasonable relationship to, and must be limited by the court to a reasonable amount in view of, the amount recovered by the prevailing party in such matter. 

12.4    Cross-Default  .  A default by either party under any other Purchase Agreement or the Purchase Agreements shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under this Agreement and a default by either party under this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be a default by such party under the other Purchase Agreements.     

Section 13.  Condemnation  .  If, between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings are initiated or threatened that might result in the taking of any part of the Improvements or the Land or access to the Land from adjacent roadways, then Buyer at its sole discretion may elect to terminate this Agreement without cost, obligation, or liability on the part of Buyer, in which event this Agreement shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease and the Earnest Money shall be returned to Buyer irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3.  If this Agreement is not terminated, then Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any award pertaining to the Property made in connection with such condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of written notice from Seller of such condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, whether it elects to exercise its right to terminate.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election. 

Section 14.    Damage or Destruction  .  Seller shall bear all risk of loss to the Property until the Closing Date.  If, between the Contract Date and the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty and the cost to repair and restore the Property is more than $2,500,000.00, then Buyer at its sole discretion may elect to terminate this Agreement without cost, obligation, or liability on Buyer s part, in which event all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease and the Earnest Money will be returned to Buyer irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3.  If either this Agreement is not terminable in accordance with the foregoing, or is terminable but is not terminated, then Seller shall, upon Closing, assign to Buyer all of Seller s right, title, and interest in and to any insurance proceeds, including without limitation any rent loss insurance proceeds (except for proceeds for rent losses prior to Closing), payable as a result of such damage or destruction, plus Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of any deductible losses under such insurance policies and at Closing shall have no further repair or restoration obligations.  Seller shall advise Buyer regarding the insurance policies covering such damage or destruction and the probable amount of any insurance proceeds payable as a result of such damage or destruction.  Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from Seller of such damage or destruction of its election.  If Buyer fails to notify Seller of its election within said 15-day period, such failure shall constitute an election not to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for such election.

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER SELLER, NOR ANY AGENT, MEMBER, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY ACTING ON BEHALF OF SELLER HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY SUCH AGREEMENT, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

16.2.   
			 Change of Conditions  .  Buyer shall accept the Property at Closing in the same condition as the Property is as of the Contract Date, as such condition shall have changed by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration and, subject to Sections 14 and 15 hereof, condemnation or damage by fire or other casualty.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present condition, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to complete closing under this Agreement and pay the full Consideration.  Seller has no obligation to make any repairs or replacements required by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or condemnation or fire or other casualty, but may, at its option and its cost (including the use of insurance proceeds as herein provided), make any such repairs and replacements prior to the Closing Date.

16.5.   
			 Effect of Disclaimers  .

17.3.   
			 Brokers  .  Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that such representing and warranting party has not employed or made any commitment to a broker or agent (including without limitation any real estate or securities broker, agent, dealer, or salesperson) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, except for Buyer s Broker and Seller s Broker.  Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from any loss or cost suffered or incurred by it as a result of the indemnifying parties  representation herein being untrue.

Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Property, and no representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein or incorporated herein by reference shall be of any force or effect.

17.10.   
			 Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .

If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .

Buyer and Seller further acknowledge that they intend for the Closing of this transaction to require the Closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements and for the closing of the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreements to require the Closing of this transaction.  Buyer and Seller agree that in the event Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement for any reason as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof (other than termination as a result of (i) the willful or intentional breach or default under this Agreement by Seller or (ii) Seller's failure to remove a Financial Encumbrance as defined in Section 5.3), then such termination shall be deemed a termination of all Purchase Agreements; provided, however, Seller in its sole discretion may waive the termination of any or all Purchase Agreements and elect to proceed with the transaction pursuant to the remaining terms and conditions of such Purchase Agreement(s). 

Section 3  .    Earnest Money  .

The Earnest Money shall be held by Closing Agent until disbursed as set forth in this Agreement.  Buyer shall execute and deliver any appropriate W-9 forms requested by Closing Agent.  If and only if (a) Buyer acquires the Property, and (b) the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall be paid to Seller and applied as a credit against the Consideration.  If the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is not the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall not be applied as a credit against the Consideration in this transaction, but shall rather be applied as a credit against the consideration of such final closing.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement are not met or resolved, or if Buyer terminates this Agreement as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof, then Closing Agent shall return the Earnest Money to Buyer, subject to Section 3.3 below.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Buyer, and if thereafter Buyer fails to acquire the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Earnest Money shall be delivered to Seller and shall be retained by Seller as liquidated damages.  If there is a dispute between Buyer and Seller as to the distribution of the Earnest Money, or if for any other reason Closing Agent in good faith elects not to make any such disbursement, then Closing Agent shall continue to hold the Earnest Money until otherwise directed by written instructions executed both by Seller and Buyer, or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Upon request, Buyer and Seller shall execute Closing Agent s standard earnest money escrow agreement; provided, however, that if there is any conflict or inconsistency between such escrow agreement and this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control.

No investment of the Earnest Money shall have a maturity date beyond the Closing Date.

(b) 

Rent  .  The parties shall Prorate all Rent actually received by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs.  At Closing, to the extent actually received by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer any and all prepaid Rent relating or pertaining to the Property.  If Seller receives payment for Rent after Closing, Seller shall immediately pay to Buyer the portion of such payment which relates to the period on and after the Closing Date, and any portion of such payment which relates to the period prior to Closing which was credited to Seller at Closing.  Annual Rent increases pursuant to the Leases are to be paid through the day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that if this transaction Closes, Buyer will receive a Rent credit at Closing equal to the annual Rent increases beginning November 1, 2016 through the day preceding the Closing Date, which the parties shall Prorate for the month in which Closing occurs.  Any Capital Expenditures Obligation (as defined in the Leases) of Seller, as landlord, pursuant to the Leases with respect to an annual $350 per unit allowance toward payment or reimbursement of Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Leases) made by Tenant shall be paid by Seller through December 31, 2016, with any unused portion on any Property for the year 2016 to be applied as a credit to the

(c) 

Taxes  .  The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the Leases, Tenant is obligated to reimburse Seller as landlord for all Taxes and installments of special assessments of the Property.  Seller shall not provide a credit to Buyer at Closing for any proration of Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year, unless Seller has collected money under the Leases for Taxes and has not paid a corresponding amount to the relevant taxing authority.  Buyer shall provide a credit to Seller for any Taxes or installments of special assessments that are due and payable in the Closing Year that Seller as landlord has paid which are the responsibilities of Tenant pursuant to the Leases and Tenant has not yet reimbursed to Seller as landlord in accordance with the Leases.  Buyer shall pay all Taxes and installments of special assessments due and payable in the Closing Year and for years prior to the Closing Year, if any remain outstanding, and shall upon request furnish evidence of such payment to Title Company.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for all remaining future Taxes and installments of any special assessments.  Real property tax refunds and credits received after the Closing shall belong to Buyer.

Commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay all utility charges for the Property (excluding any utilities held in the name of Tenant).     

(e) 

Tenant Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, if Tenant is obligated under the Leases to directly pay any Operating Expenses (including without limitation Taxes), then said items will not be prorated between the parties.     

(f) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.     

(g) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Tenant for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and      

6 

Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.     

4.3   Contingent Payment.

The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.   

5.2  New Survey  .  Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as part of the Due Diligence Documents, a copy of the most recent surveys of the Property in Seller s possession (the    Existing Survey   ).

Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the New Surveys.  The New Surveys shall be certified to Seller, Buyer, and the Title Company.  Seller shall receive a signed original of the final New Surveys as soon as it is available and in any event, at or prior to Closing. 

5.3  Title Notice  .  If the Title Commitments or Existing Surveys disclose matters that are not acceptable to Buyer (   Unpermitted Exceptions   ), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the    Title Notice   ) of Buyer s objections within the later of (i) ten (10) days after Buyer has received both the Title Commitments and the Existing Surveys, or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the Inspection Date (the    Objection Period   ).  Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller   

7

Buyer may, at or prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing (the    Gap Notice   ) of any objections to title raised by the Title Company after Buyer s receipt of the initial Title Commitments, or of any material defect shown on the New Surveys that was not disclosed on the Existing Surveys; provided that Buyer must notify the Seller of such objection to title within ten (10) days of being made aware of the existence of any such new objection.  If Buyer sends a Gap Notice to the Seller, Buyer and the Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section 5.3 hereof.

Prior to performing any environmental investigation of the Property (other than a Phase I environmental site assessment), Buyer shall notify Seller of the name of the environmental consultant that will conduct the investigation.  Buyer shall not have the right to disturb the soil at the Property, or to perform any destructive or invasive testing, without Seller s prior written consent.

The parties agree that the court presiding over the litigation shall determine whether a party is a  prevailing party,  and shall determine the reasonable amount of attorney s fees and costs recoverable.  The parties agree that the amount of attorneys  fees and costs which may be awarded must bear a reasonable relationship to, and must be limited by the court to a reasonable amount in view of, the amount recovered by the prevailing party in such matter.

Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of written notice from Seller of such condemnation or eminent domain proceeding, whether it elects to exercise its right to terminate.

Section 16  .    Condition of Property  . 

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER SELLER, NOR ANY AGENT, MEMBER, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY ACTING ON BEHALF OF SELLER HAS MADE OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY SUCH AGREEMENT, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL SURVIVE CLOSING AND DELIVERY OF THE DEED, AND SHALL BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AND MADE A PART OF ALL DOCUMENTS DELIVERED BY SELLER TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY.     

16.2.   
			 Change of Conditions  .  Buyer shall accept the Property at Closing in the same condition as the Property is as of the Contract Date, as such condition shall have changed by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration and, subject to Sections 14 and 15 hereof, condemnation or damage by fire or other casualty.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present condition, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to complete closing under this Agreement and pay the full Consideration.  Seller has no obligation to make any repairs or replacements required by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or condemnation or fire or other casualty, but may, at its option and its cost (including the use of insurance proceeds as herein provided), make any such repairs and replacements prior to the Closing Date.     

16.3.   
			 Condition of Delivery  .  Seller has no obligation to deliver the Property in a "broom clean" condition, and at Closing Seller may leave in the Property all items of personal property and equipment,      

22 

partitions and debris as are now presently therein and as would accumulate in the normal course of operating and maintaining the Property.     

16.4.   
			 Release  .

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that an assignment to such an entity under this Section 17.2 will not release Buyer from any liability or obligation under this Agreement, and that Buyer shall remain liable to Seller after such assignment as a principal and not as a surety or guarantor.     

17.3.   
			 Brokers  .  Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that such representing and warranting party has not employed or made any commitment to a broker or agent (including without limitation any real estate or securities broker, agent, dealer, or salesperson) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, except for Buyer s Broker and Seller s Broker.  Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from any loss or cost suffered or incurred by it as a result of the indemnifying parties  representation herein being untrue.

Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Property, and no representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein or incorporated herein by reference shall be of any force or effect.

17.10.   
			 Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.     

17.11.   
			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .  This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and is intended, and shall for all purposes be deemed to be, a single, integrated document setting forth all of the agreements and understandings of the parties hereto, and superseding all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements of such parties.  If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any provision contained herein shall be cancelled or merged with any deed or other instrument on, as of, at or by reason of the Closing, and the covenants and obligations of the parties shall survive the Closing.

			 Further Assurances  .

			 Exhibits  .  Attached hereto and forming an integral part of this Agreement are multiple exhibits, all of which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement as fully as if the contents thereof were set out in full herein at each point of reference thereto.

			           Waiver of Jury Trial  .  BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ANY ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY MANNER WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS      

25 

A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED BY THE OTHER PARTY AT CLOSING, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  Each party hereby authorizes and empowers the other to file this Section and this Agreement with the clerk or judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a written consent to waiver of jury trial.     

Section 18.  Closing Agent Duties and Disputes  .  

18.1    Other Duties of Closing Agent  .  Closing Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Buyer, whether or not Closing Agent has knowledge thereof.  Closing Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money shall be to hold, in trust, the Earnest Money and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Earnest Money and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Earnest Money and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Earnest Money or for any diminution in value of the Earnest Money from any cause, other than Closing Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Closing Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Buyer, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Closing Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Closing Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Closing Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Closing Agent.  

18.2    Disputes  .  Closing Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Earnest Money.  If, after the Inspection Date, there is any dispute as to whether Closing Agent is obligated to deliver the Earnest Money or as to whom the Earnest Money is to be delivered, Closing Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Earnest Money until receipt by Closing Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Earnest Money, or, in the absence of authorization, Closing Agent shall hold the Earnest Money until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.  Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic.  If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within 30 days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Closing Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Earnest Money with a court of the State of Colorado pending a determination.  Closing Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Closing Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Earnest Money.  Upon making delivery of the Earnest Money in the manner provided in this Agreement, Closing Agent shall have no further liability hereunder.  In no event shall Closing Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Buyer in connection with the Earnest Money.  

18.3    Reports  .  Closing Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  This provision shall survive the Closing.

If the Closing of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement is not the final closing among the Purchase Agreements, then the Earnest Money shall not be applied as a credit against the Consideration in this transaction, but shall rather be applied as a credit against the consideration of such final closing.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement are not met or resolved, or if Buyer terminates this Agreement as expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions hereof, then Closing Agent shall return the Earnest Money to Buyer, subject to Section 3.3 below.  If all of the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by Buyer, and if thereafter Buyer fails to acquire the Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the Earnest Money shall be delivered to Seller and shall be retained by Seller as liquidated damages.  If there is a dispute between Buyer and Seller as to the distribution of the Earnest Money, or if for any other reason Closing Agent in good faith elects not to make any such disbursement, then Closing Agent shall continue to hold the Earnest Money until otherwise directed by written instructions executed both by Seller and Buyer, or by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Upon request, Buyer and Seller shall execute Closing Agent s standard earnest money escrow agreement; provided, however, that if there is any conflict or inconsistency between such escrow agreement and this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control.  

3.2                Investments  .  Following the collection of the Earnest Money, Closing Agent shall, at the written request of Buyer, invest the Earnest Money in:  (a) obligations of the United States government, its agencies or independent departments; (b) certificates of deposit issued by a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship; or (c) either a non-interest bearing account providing F.D.I.C. insurance in the full amount of the Earnest Money, or an interest-bearing account at a banking institution with assets in excess of $1 billion, and with which Closing Agent has a substantial banking relationship.        No investment of the Earnest Money shall have a maturity date beyond the Closing Date. 

3.3   Non-Refundable Earnest Money  .  Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be non-refundable to Buyer in accordance with the following schedule:     

5 

Section 4  .    Consideration and Prorations  . 

4.1      Consideration  .  The    Consideration    shall be the sum of Fourteen Million and 00/100 Dollars ($14,000,000.00).  The parties shall make the prorations and allocations set forth in this section as a credit or debit to the Consideration.  The balance of the Consideration shall be paid by Buyer to Escrow Agent, to be released to Seller at Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by not later than 12:00 p.m. Central Time. 

4.2      Prorations  . 

(a) 

General  .  For purposes of calculating prorations, Buyer shall be deemed to be in title to the Property, and therefore entitled to the income therefrom and responsible for the expenses thereof, for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs.  All prorations shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days of the year and month that shall have elapsed prior to the Closing Date.  There will be no proration for insurance, it being understood and agreed that Seller will cancel their insurance and that Buyer will be required to secure its own insurance.       

(b) 

Rent  .  The parties shall Prorate all Rent actually received by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs other than Delinquent Rent (which is defined and covered in Section 4.2(e) below).  At Closing, to the extent actually received by Seller prior to Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer any and all prepaid Rent relating or pertaining to the Property.  If Seller receives payment for Rent (other than Delinquent Rent) after Closing, Seller shall immediately pay to Buyer the portion of such payment which relates to the period on and after the Closing Date, and any portion of such payment which relates to the period prior to Closing which was credited to Seller at Closing.         

(c) 

Taxes  .  The parties shall Prorate all Taxes payable for the Closing Year, on a calendar year basis, utilizing actual final tax bills if available prior to Closing.  If final tax bills are not available, the parties shall Prorate Taxes on the basis of the projected Taxes if a projection is available from the applicable taxing authority or, if a projection is not available, on the basis of the most recent final tax bills.  Seller shall pay all Taxes for years prior to the Closing Year, and shall upon request furnish evidence of such payment to Title Company.  Regarding special assessments, it is the intent of the parties to Prorate any installments of special assessments that are payable in the Closing Year, and that Buyer shall be solely responsible for all remaining future installments of any such special assessments.  Real property tax refunds and credits received after the Closing which are attributable to Taxes payable for years prior to the Closing Year shall belong to Seller.  Any such refunds and credits attributable to Taxes payable for the Closing Year shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of Closing after deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of collection thereof.  If any tax appeal or certiorari proceedings has not been finally resolved or settled prior to the Closing, and relates to any Taxes payable for the years prior to the Closing Year, then Seller shall be entitled to control the disposition of any such tax appeal or certiorari proceeding; any resulting refunds for years prior to the Closing Year shall belong to Seller, and any refund for the Closing Year shall be apportioned in accordance with the preceding sentence.  The apportionment and adjustment obligations set forth in this subsection shall survive the Closing.  To the extent that local custom for prorating Taxes in the state in which a Property is located varies from the proration method described above, such local custom shall be applied as to the Property located in that state.     

6 

(d) 

Operating Expenses  .  Except for Taxes, which are covered by Section 4.2(c) above, the parties shall Prorate all Operating Expenses.  The prorations under this subsection shall be based on actual invoices if reasonably possible.  If actual invoices are not available in advance of Closing, then the prorations shall be calculated based on Seller's good faith estimates thereof.  Buyer shall order final meter readings to be made as of the Closing Date for all utility services serving the Property.  Buyer shall coordinate the transfer of all utilities to Buyer effective on the Closing Date.  Seller shall pay all utility charges for the Property (excluding any utilities held in the name of any Residents) through the day preceding the Closing Date.  Commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay all utility charges for the Property (excluding any utilities held in the name of any Residents).         

(e) 

Delinquent Rent.    For purposes of this Section 4.2,    Delinquent Rent    shall mean any Rent that, under the terms of the applicable Resident Contract, was more than 30 days past due as of the Closing Date or which has not been received in good funds by Seller on or prior to the Closing Date.  Delinquent Rent shall not be accrued or prorated at Closing.  Any Delinquent Rent that is applicable to Seller s period of ownership that is received by Buyer after the Closing Date shall be paid to Seller in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however, that all Rent collected by Buyer after the Closing Date shall be applied first to payment of all Rent due Buyer from the applicable Resident, then to Rent attributable to the month in which the Closing occurs (and prorated with respect to each parties period of ownership) and then after any deduction allowed by this subsection for collection costs, to all Delinquent Rent due to Seller.  Seller shall have the right to use whatever means Seller determines prior to Closing to collect Delinquent Rent including, without limitation, commencing collection actions against Residents owing Delinquent Rent.  Following Closing, Buyer shall use good faith commercially reasonable efforts to collect any Delinquent Rent.  If Buyer commences any action or proceeding against any Resident and as a result thereof collects any Delinquent Rent which Buyer is required to remit to Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and retain a portion of the amount collected which is equal to the prorata share of the reasonable third party expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the collection of any such Delinquent Rent.  For a period of 120 days following the Closing, Buyer shall not waive any Delinquent Rent or modify or amend any Resident Contract so as to reduce the Delinquent Rent owed by the Resident for any period in which Seller is entitled to receive such Delinquent Rent, without first obtaining Seller s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned).       

(f) 

Resident Obligations  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2 to the contrary, if any Resident is obligated under its Resident Contract to directly pay any Operating Expenses (including without limitation Taxes), then said items will not be prorated between the parties.     

(g) 

Proration Statement  .  As soon as reasonably possible prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to prepare a joint statement of the prorations required by this Section (   Proration Statement   ), and shall deliver the Proration Statement to the Closing Agent for use in preparing the final settlement statements.       

(h) 

Post-Closing Reconciliation  .  As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after Closing, the parties shall work in good faith to complete a reconciliation of all prorations (   Reconciliation   ).  If there is an error on the Proration Statement used at Closing or, if after the actual figures are available as to any items that were estimated on the Proration Statement, then the proration or apportionment shall be adjusted based on the actual amounts.  As soon as reasonably possible, but in no      

7 

event more than 60 days after Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer an accounting detailing all of the Operating Expenses attributable to the Closing Year that were actually paid by Seller.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on the Reconciliation shall pay said sum to the other party within five (5) business days of the completion of the Reconciliation.  Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for the accounting and validity of billings to Residents for those Operating Expenses incurred during each of Seller s and Buyer s respective periods of ownership of the Property.  This subsection shall survive Closing.     

8.3 
			 Resident Deposits  .  At Closing Seller shall provide Buyer with an accounting of all security deposits or other refundable deposits received from (i) current or prospective residents of the Facilities and (ii) residents that have departed the Facilities within thirty (30) days prior to Closing (to the extent Seller requests Buyer to be responsible for refunding such residents and transfers the applicable deposits to Buyer), that have not yet been refunded to such residents as of the Closing Date (the    Resident Deposits   ).  Such accounting shall set forth the names of the residents or prospective residents for whom such funds are held, the amounts held on behalf of each resident or prospective resident and the Seller s warranty that the accounting is true, correct and complete.  On the Closing Date Seller shall transfer the Resident Deposits to the bank accounts designated by Buyer and Buyer shall assume the financial and custodial obligations with respect thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from all liabilities, claims and demands in the event the amount of the Resident Deposits transferred to the Buyer s bank account did not represent the full amount of such Resident Deposits then or thereafter shown to have been delivered to Seller by the current residents or prospective residents of the Facilities.      

8.4 
			 Contingent Payment.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of the Properties are sold by Buyer within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Consideration allocated to such Property.  The Deed shall contain a deed restriction granting Seller the right to receive such additional sum from Buyer.     

8.5 
			 Assumed Obligations.    In connection with Buyer s purchase of the Facilities, Buyer will only assume obligations of Seller that arise on or after the Closing Date with respect to those Seller Contracts which are assumed by Buyer.  All other liabilities and obligations of Seller will remain the sole obligation of Seller.     

Section 5  .      Title and Survey. 

5.1  Title Commitments  .  As soon as reasonably possible after the Contract Date, Seller shall coordinate the Title Company s delivery to Buyer of the Title Commitments, in the amount of the Consideration.  The Title Commitments shall show the condition of title to the Land and Improvements, shall name Buyer as the proposed insured, and shall include legible copies of all recorded exceptions and covenants, conditions, easements, and restrictions affecting the Property.  The Title Commitments shall also contain the conditions upon which the Title Company will issue the owners title insurance policies at Closing pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ).  However, this condition shall be deemed satisfied if the Title Policies (or any such endorsements or reinsurance and/or coinsurance) is not issued by reason of Buyer s failing to satisfy (a) the Title Company s routine underwriting requirements (including the  written or pre-printed requirements  set forth in the applicable commitment) for issuance thereof, or (b) any other requirements of Buyer specified by the Title Company in writing prior to the Inspection Date for issuance thereof.   

5.2  New Survey  .  Seller shall deliver to Buyer, as part of the Due Diligence Documents, a copy of the most recent surveys of the Property in Seller s possession (the    Existing Survey   ).  In the event   

8 

Buyer commissions new surveys of the Property (the    New Survey   ), then Seller shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer regarding the preparation of the New Surveys.  Buyer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the New Surveys.  The New Surveys shall be certified to Seller, Buyer, and the Title Company.  Seller shall receive a signed original of the final New Surveys as soon as it is available and in any event, at or prior to Closing. 

5.3  Title Notice  .  If the Title Commitments or Existing Surveys disclose matters that are not acceptable to Buyer (   Unpermitted Exceptions   ), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the    Title Notice   ) of Buyer s objections within the later of (i) ten (10) days after Buyer has received both the Title Commitments and the Existing Surveys, or (ii) ten (10) days prior to the Inspection Date (the    Objection Period   ).  Mortgages, deeds of trust, assignment of leases and rents and Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (collectively, referred to as    Financial Encumbrances   ) shall be deemed to be objected to and shall be removed prior to or at the Closing.  In the event that Buyer notifies Seller of any objections within the Objection Period, then Seller shall notify Buyer in writing, within ten (10) days following the date of receipt of Buyer s notice of such objections, that either: (a) the Unpermitted Exceptions will be, prior to Closing, removed from the Commitments, insured over by the Title Company pursuant to an endorsement to the Title Policies, or otherwise cured to Buyer s reasonable satisfaction; or (b) Seller declines to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer within such 10-day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have declined to arrange to have the Unpermitted Exceptions removed, insured over, or otherwise cured.  If Seller declines to arrange to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure any of the Unpermitted Exceptions, then Buyer shall elect, through written notice to Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer s receipt of Seller s written declination, to:  (a) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of the Earnest Money irrespective of whether any or all of the Earnest Money has  gone hard  as described in Section 3.3; or (b) waive such objections and take title subject to the Unpermitted Exceptions that Seller has declined to remove, insure over, or otherwise cure.  The Closing Date shall be adjusted, if necessary, to allow for any elections allowed or required by this Section. 

5.4  Pre-Closing  Gap  Title Obligations.    Buyer may, at or prior to Closing, notify Seller in writing (the    Gap Notice   ) of any objections to title raised by the Title Company after Buyer s receipt of the initial Title Commitments, or of any material defect shown on the New Surveys that was not disclosed on the Existing Surveys; provided that Buyer must notify the Seller of such objection to title within ten (10) days of being made aware of the existence of any such new objection.  If Buyer sends a Gap Notice to the Seller, Buyer and the Seller shall have the same rights and obligations with respect to such notice as apply to a Title Notice under Section 5.3 hereof. 

Section 6  .    Buyer s Inspection  . 

6.1      Document Inspection  .  Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Buyer (by itself or through such agents, consultants and others as Buyer shall designate) may inspect, test and analyze the Property (provided that any inspections or testing of the Land or Improvements shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.2 below).

Buyer hereby agrees that said appraisals shall not be distributed to financing sources other than regulated financial service companies relying on the contents of such appraisals in order to provide mortgage debt. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and understands that some of the materials delivered by Seller have been prepared by parties other than Seller or Seller's current property manager.

Buyer agrees to conduct such activities during normal business hours to the extent practicable.  Buyer agrees to pay all costs of such investigations, inspections, tests and studies and to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any claims for injury or death to persons or damage to property arising out of any action of any person or firm entering the Property on Buyer s behalf as aforesaid (  provided   that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing indemnity shall not be applicable if such claims arise from or are in connection with any such damages to the extent resulting from a pre-existing condition, unless exacerbated or adversely affected by Buyer or any of its employees, consultants, agents, prospective lenders (and their consultants) or representatives, and, in such case, only to the extent so exacerbated), which indemnity shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement without the Closing having occurred.  Prior to performing any environmental investigation of the Property (other than a Phase I environmental site assessment), Buyer shall notify Seller of the name of the environmental consultant that will conduct the investigation.

16.1.   
			 No Warranties  .  THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SELLER AND BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY AND THE SALE THEREOF IS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  THE PARTIES ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, PROVISIONS, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL AND WHETHER MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY) OTHER THAN AS ARE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH AND STIPULATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  WITHOUT IN ANY MANNER LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE FULLY INSPECTED THE PROPERTY OR WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, ARE OR WILL BE FULLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION THEREOF, AND THAT THE PROPERTY HAS BEEN PURCHASED BY BUYER IN AN "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS" CONDITION AND WITH ALL EXISTING DEFECTS (PATENT AND LATENT) AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT IN RELIANCE ON ANY AGREEMENT, UNDERSTANDING, CONDITION, WARRANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR REPRESENTATION MADE BY SELLER OR ANY AGENT, EMPLOYEE, MEMBER, OFFICER OR PRINCIPAL OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY ELSEWHERE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AS TO THE FINANCIAL OR PHYSICAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL) CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PROPERTY, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO ANY PERMITTED USE THEREOF, THE ZONING CLASSIFICATION THEREOF OR COMPLIANCE THEREOF WITH FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAWS, AS TO THE INCOME OR EXPENSE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

24 

16.2.   
			 Change of Conditions  .  Buyer shall accept the Property at Closing in the same condition as the Property is as of the Contract Date, as such condition shall have changed by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration and, subject to Sections 14 and 15 hereof, condemnation or damage by fire or other casualty.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer specifically acknowledges that the fact that any portion of the Property may not be in working order or condition at the Closing Date by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or damage by fire or other casualty, or by reason of its present condition, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to complete closing under this Agreement and pay the full Consideration.  Seller has no obligation to make any repairs or replacements required by reason of wear and tear and natural deterioration or condemnation or fire or other casualty, but may, at its option and its cost (including the use of insurance proceeds as herein provided), make any such repairs and replacements prior to the Closing Date.     

16.3.   
			 Condition of Delivery  .  Seller has no obligation to deliver the Property in a "broom clean" condition, and at Closing Seller may leave in the Property all items of personal property and equipment, partitions and debris as are now presently therein and as would accumulate in the normal course of operating and maintaining the Property.     

16.4.   
			 Release  .  WITHOUT LIMITING THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 16.1 ABOVE AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER, FOR ITSELF AND ITS AGENTS, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER AND (AS THE CASE MAY BE) SELLER'S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, TRUSTEES, PARTNERS, EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS, AGENTS AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL RIGHTS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS  FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS WHETHER SUIT IS INSTITUTED OR NOT) WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, LIQUIDATED OR CONTINGENT (HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE "  CLAIMS  "), WHICH BUYER HAS OR MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO (i) ANY DEFECTS (PATENT OR LATENT), ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPERTY WHETHER THE SAME ARE THE RESULT OF NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, OR (ii) ANY OTHER CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, AFFECTING THE PROPERTY WHETHER THE SAME ARE A RESULT OF NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY, BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION OR CONTRIBUTION ARISING UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), WHETHER ARISING BASED ON EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER SELLER S PERIOD OF OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY AND WHETHER BASED ON THEORIES OF INDEMNIFICATION, CONTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE.

16.5.   
			 Effect of Disclaimers  .

Section 17  .    Miscellaneous  . 

17.1.   
			 Governing Law; Headings; Rules of Construction  .

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that an assignment to such an entity under this Section 17.2 will not release Buyer from any liability or obligation under this Agreement, and that Buyer shall remain liable to Seller after such assignment as a principal and not as a surety or guarantor.     

17.3.   
			 Brokers  .  Buyer and Seller each warrant and represent to the other that such representing and warranting party has not employed or made any commitment to a broker or agent (including without limitation any real estate or securities broker, agent, dealer, or salesperson) in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, except for Buyer s Broker and Seller s Broker.  Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless from any loss or cost suffered or incurred by it as a result of the indemnifying parties  representation herein being untrue.  Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Seller s Broker.  Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any resulting fee or expenses relating to the Buyer s Broker.     

17.4.   
			 No Waiver  .  Neither the failure of either party to exercise any power given such party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by the other party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver of either party s right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, except the Closing of this Agreement shall constitute waiver of all conditions to Closing except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing at Closing.     

17.5.   
			 Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the Property, and no representations, inducements, promises or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein or incorporated herein by reference shall be of any force or effect.     

26

17.10.   
			 Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.     

17.11.   
			 Time of the Essence  .  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and each and every term and condition hereof.     

17.12.   
			 Severability  .  This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and is intended, and shall for all purposes be deemed to be, a single, integrated document setting forth all of the agreements and understandings of the parties hereto, and superseding all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements of such parties.  If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall for any reason and to any extent be held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term or provision shall be ignored, and to the maximum extent possible, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, but without giving effect to such term or provision.     

17.13.   
			 Survival  .  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any provision contained herein shall be cancelled or merged with any deed or other instrument on, as of, at or by reason of the Closing, and the covenants and obligations of the parties shall survive the Closing.

			 Further Assurances  .

			 Seller 1031 Exchange  .  Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other for the purpose of a possible tax deferred exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code.

17.16.   
			 Exhibits  .  Attached hereto and forming an integral part of this Agreement are multiple exhibits, all of which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement as fully as if the contents thereof were set out in full herein at each point of reference thereto.     

27

			           Waiver of Jury Trial  .  BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ANY ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY MANNER WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED BY THE OTHER PARTY AT CLOSING, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  Each party hereby authorizes and empowers the other to file this Section and this Agreement with the clerk or judge of any court of competent jurisdiction as a written consent to waiver of jury trial.     

Section 18.  Closing Agent Duties and Disputes  .  

18.1    Other Duties of Closing Agent  .  Closing Agent shall not be bound in any way by any other agreement or contract between Seller and Buyer, whether or not Closing Agent has knowledge thereof.  Closing Agent s only duties and responsibilities with respect to the Earnest Money shall be to hold, in trust, the Earnest Money and other documents delivered to it as agent and to dispose of the Earnest Money and such documents in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to protect the Earnest Money and shall not be responsible for any failure to demand, collect or enforce any obligation with respect to the Earnest Money or for any diminution in value of the Earnest Money from any cause, other than Closing Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Closing Agent may, at the expense of Seller and Buyer, consult with counsel and accountants in connection with its duties under this Agreement.  Closing Agent shall not be liable to the parties hereto for any act taken, suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel and accountants.  Closing Agent shall not be obligated to take any action hereunder that may, in its reasonable judgment, result in any liability to it unless Closing Agent shall have been furnished with reasonable indemnity satisfactory in amount, form and substance to Closing Agent.  

18.2    Disputes  .  Closing Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Earnest Money.  If, after the Inspection Date, there is any dispute as to whether Closing Agent is obligated to deliver the Earnest Money or as to whom the Earnest Money is to be delivered, Closing Agent shall not make any delivery, but shall hold the Earnest Money until receipt by Closing Agent of an authorization in writing, signed by all the parties having an interest in the dispute, directing the disposition of the Earnest Money, or, in the absence of authorization, Closing Agent shall hold the Earnest Money until the final determination of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding.  Closing Agent shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity or validity of any notice, instruction, instrument, document or other item delivered to it, and it shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with any written notice, direction or instruction given to it under this Agreement and believed by it to be authentic.  If written authorization is not given, or proceedings for a determination are not begun, within 30 days after the date scheduled for the closing of title and diligently continued, Closing Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit the Earnest Money with a court of the State of Colorado pending a determination.  Closing Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and disbursements incurred in its capacity as Closing Agent, by the party determined not to be entitled to the Earnest Money.  Upon making delivery of the Earnest Money in the manner provided in this Agreement, Closing Agent shall have no further liability hereunder.     

28 

In no event shall Closing Agent be under any duty to institute, defend or participate in any proceeding that may arise between Seller and Buyer in connection with the Earnest Money.  

18.3    Reports  .  Closing Agent shall be responsible for the timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  This provision shall survive the Closing.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed and sealed by its duly authorized signatory, effective as of the day and year first above written.
