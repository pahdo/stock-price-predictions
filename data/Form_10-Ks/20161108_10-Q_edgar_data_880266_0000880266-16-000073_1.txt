  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of AGCO Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Company  or  AGCO ) included herein have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  ( ASU 2016-16 ), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Consequently, the standard eliminates the exception to the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer other than for inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-15 may be applied using a retrospective approach or a prospective approach, if impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2017 and that the adoption will not have a material impact on its cash flows.  
       
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. This standard will likely impact the results of operations and financial condition of the Company s finance joint ventures and as a result, will likely impact the Company s  Investment in affiliates  and  Equity in net earnings of affiliates  upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the standard s impact.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, the standard clarifies the statement of cash flow presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The application methods are specific to each component of the ASU and may be applied using a prospective, retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
    
  In February 2016, the     FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which supersedes the existing lease guidance under current U.S. GAAP.  ASU 2016-02 is based on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases. The standard does not significantly change the lessees  recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard. Leases are classified as finance or operating. ASU 2016-02 s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize a lease liability for payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term of an operating lease arrangement. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting

  (unaudited) 

policy election to not recognize the asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessors  accounting under the standard is largely unchanged from the previous accounting standard. In addition, ASU 2016-02 expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
           
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive, single revenue recognition model that provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures also will be required to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year or to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not any earlier than the original effective date. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  ASU 2016-11,  Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 and each have the same effective date as the original standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these standards on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.

3.    RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES 
    
  Since 2014, the Company has initiated several actions to rationalize employee headcount at various manufacturing facilities and administrative offices in order to reduce costs in response to softening global demand and reduced production volumes. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded severance and related costs associated with various rationalizations in the United States, South America and Europe, connected with the termination of approximately   350   employees.

4.    STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS 
    
  The Company recorded stock compensation expense as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions):

Long-Term Incentive Plan and Related Performance Awards 
    
  The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance awards granted under the 2006 Plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $47.93   and   $45.54  , respectively.  
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   1,351,350   performance awards related to varying performance periods. The awards granted assume the maximum target level of performance is achieved, as applicable. The compensation expense associated with all awards granted under the 2006 Plan is amortized ratably over the vesting or performance period based on the Company s projected assessment of the level of performance that will be achieved and earned. Performance award transactions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows and are presented as if the Company were to achieve its maximum levels of performance under the plan awards: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the total compensation cost related to unearned performance awards not yet recognized, assuming the Company s current projected assessment of the level of performance that will be achieved and earned, was approximately   $51.0 million  , and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately   two   years. 
       
  Restricted Stock Unit Awards       
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   141,202   restricted stock unit ( RSU ) awards. These awards entitle the participant to receive   one   share of the Company s common stock for each RSU granted and vest one-third per year over a   three  -year requisite service period. The compensation expense associated with these awards is amortized ratably over the requisite service period for the awards that are expected to vest. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the RSUs granted under the 2006 Plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $45.10   and   $44.03  , respectively. RSU transactions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the total compensation cost related to the unvested RSUs not yet recognized was approximately   $7.4 million  , and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately   two   years.

Director Restricted Stock Grants 
    
  The 2006 Plan provides for annual restricted stock grants of the Company s common stock to all non-employee directors. The   2016   grant was made on April 28, 2016 and equated to   20,232   shares of common stock, of which   15,395   shares of common stock were issued after shares were withheld for taxes. The Company recorded stock compensation expense of approximately   $1.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   associated with these grants.

The Company currently amortizes certain acquired intangible assets, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives, which range from   five   to   50   years. 
       
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows (in millions): 

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist. The Company conducts its annual impairment analyses as of   October 1   each fiscal year. 

6.    INDEBTEDNESS 
    
  Indebtedness consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

1.056% Senior Term Loan  
    
  In December 2014, the Company entered into a term loan with the European Investment Bank, which provided the Company with the ability to borrow up to    200.0 million  . The    200.0 million   (or approximately   $224.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) of funding was received on January 15, 2015 with a maturity date of January 15, 2020. The Company has the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date. Interest is payable on the term loan at   1.056%   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.  
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  The Company s revolving credit and term loan facility consists of an   $800.0 million   multi-currency revolving credit facility and a    312.0 million   (or approximately   $350.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) term loan facility. The maturity date of the credit facility is June 26, 2020. Under the credit facility agreement, interest accrues on amounts outstanding, at the Company s option, depending on the currency borrowed, at either (1) LIBOR or EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from   1.0%   to   1.75%   based on the Company s leverage ratio, or (2) the base rate, which is equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent s base lending rate for the applicable currency, (ii) the federal funds rate plus   0.5%  , and (iii) one-month LIBOR for loans denominated in U.S. dollars plus   1.0%   plus a margin ranging from   0.0%   to   0.25%   based on the Company s leverage ratio.  As is more fully described in Note 11, the Company entered into an interest rate swap in 2015 to convert the term loan facility s floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of   0.33%   plus the applicable margin over the remaining life of the term loan facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $953.8 million   of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and availability to borrow approximately   $196.9 million   under the facility. Approximately   $603.1 million   was outstanding under the multi- 
  
   14 

     Table of Contents

  (unaudited) 

currency revolving credit facility and    312.0 million   (or approximately   $350.7 million  ) was outstanding under the term loan facility as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  ,   no   amounts were outstanding under the Company s multi-currency revolving credit facility, and the Company had the ability to borrow approximately   $800.0 million   under the facility.  Approximately    312.0 million   (or approximately   $338.9 million  ) was outstanding under the term loan facility as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  During 2015, the Company designated its    312.0 million   (  $350.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) term loan facility as a hedge of its net investment in foreign operations to offset foreign currency translation gains or losses on the net investment. See Note 11 for additional information about the net investment hedge.  
    
  Senior Term Loan 
    
  On April 26, 2016, the Company entered into   two   term loan agreements with Co peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. ( Rabobank ), in the amount of    100.0 million   and    200.0 million  , respectively. The    300.0 million   (or approximately   $337.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) of funding was received on April 26, 2016 and was partially used to repay the Company s 4 % senior term loan with Rabobank which was due May 2, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of approximately    99.6 million   (or approximately   $112.2 million  ) after debt issuance costs. The provisions of the two term loans are identical in nature. The Company has the ability to prepay the term loans before their maturity date on April 26, 2021. Interest is payable on the term loans per annum, equal to the EURIBOR plus a margin ranging from   1.0%   to   1.75%   based on the Company s net leverage ratio. Interest is paid quarterly in arrears.  
    
  5    7   /  8  %  Senior Notes  
    
  The Company s   $306.9 million   of 5   7   /  8  % senior notes due December 1, 2021 constitute senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Interest is payable on the notes semi-annually in arrears. At any time prior to September 1, 2021, the Company may redeem the notes, in whole or in part from time to time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)   100%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date at the treasury rate plus   0.5%  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any. Beginning September 1, 2021, the Company may redeem the notes, in whole or in part from time to time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any.  As is more fully described in Note 11, the Company entered into an interest rate swap in 2015 to convert the senior notes  fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate over the remaining life of the senior notes. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company terminated the interest rate swap. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred gain of approximately   $7.3 million   associated with the termination, which will be amortized as a reduction to  Interest expense, net  over the remaining term of the 5   7   /  8  % senior notes through December 1, 2021.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized portion of the deferred gain was approximately   $6.9 million   and the amortization for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $0.4 million  .   
    
  Former 4    1   /  2  % Senior Term Loan  
    
  On April 26, 2016, the Company repaid its    200.0 million   (or approximately   $225.4 million  ) 4   1   /  2  % senior term loan with Rabobank that was due May 2, 2016. The Company had the ability to prepay the term loan before its maturity date. Interest was payable on the term loan at 4   1   /  2  % per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.

Term Loans 
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Company borrowed an aggregate amount of    375.0 million   through a group of   seven   related term loan agreements. The    375.0 million   (or approximately   $411.5 million   as of October 19, 2016) was used to repay borrowings made under the Company s revolving credit facility, which funded the acquisition of Cimbria (Note 2).  The Company received net proceeds of approximately    373.2 million   (or approximately   $409.5 million   as of October 19, 2016) after debt issuance costs. The provisions of the term loan agreements are identical in nature, with the exception of interest rate terms and maturities. The Company has the ability to prepay the term loans before their maturity dates. Interest is payable on the term loans in arrears either semi-annually or annually as provided below (in millions):    

Standby Letters of Credit and Similar Instruments 
    
  The Company has arrangements with various banks to issue standby letters of credit or similar instruments, which guarantee the Company s obligations for the purchase or sale of certain inventories and for potential claims exposure for insurance coverage. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , outstanding letters of credit totaled   $17.3 million   and   $17.5 million  , respectively. 

7.    INVENTORIES 
    
    Inventories at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in millions):

8.    PRODUCT WARRANTY 
    
  The warranty reserve activity for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   consisted of the following (in millions): 

The Company s agricultural equipment products generally are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for a period of   one   to   four   years. The Company accrues for future warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience. Approximately   $215.1 million   and   $195.2 million   of warranty reserves are included in  Accrued expenses  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Approximately   $33.8 million   and   $35.1 million   of warranty reserves are included in  Other noncurrent liabilities  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

9.    NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 
    
    Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding SSARs and the vesting of performance share awards and RSUs using the treasury stock method when the effects of such assumptions are dilutive. A reconciliation of net income attributable to AGCO Corporation and its subsidiaries and weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows (in millions, except per share data): 

SSARs to purchase approximately   1.5 million   and   1.2 million   shares of the Company s common stock for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   0.9 million   shares of the Company s common stock for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were outstanding but not included in the calculation of weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding because they had an antidilutive impact.

10.    INCOME TAXES 
    
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $147.7 million   and   $133.0 million  , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the Company s effective tax rate if recognized. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $54.8 million   and   $61.2 million  , respectively, of accrued or deferred taxes related to uncertain income tax positions connected with ongoing income tax audits in various jurisdictions that it expects to settle or pay in the next 12 months. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $19.2 million   and   $18.3 million  , respectively. Generally, tax years   2010   through   2015   remain open to examination by taxing authorities in the United States and certain other foreign tax jurisdictions. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash deferred income tax charge of approximately   $31.6 million   to increase the valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets in the United States for previous periods. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assessed the likelihood that its deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determined that the adjustment to the valuation allowance at   September 30, 2016   was appropriate. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including the current economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its remaining deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years.

11.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  All derivatives are recognized on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as either (1) a fair value hedge of a recognized liability, (2) a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (4) a non-designated derivative instrument. 
    
  The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items or the net investment hedges in foreign operations. When it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued on a prospective basis.  
    
  The Company categorizes its derivative assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the assumptions used in valuing the asset or liability. See Note 15 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy as per the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 820,  Fair Value Measurements.  The Company s valuation techniques are designed to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  
    
  Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company has significant manufacturing operations in the United States, France, Germany, Finland and Brazil, and it purchases a portion of its tractors, combines and components from third-party foreign suppliers, primarily in various European countries and in Japan. The Company also sells products in over   140   countries throughout the world. The Company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar and the Euro in relation to the British pound. 
    
  The Company attempts to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the anticipated settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales. Where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur, the Company hedges certain, but not all, of its exposures through the use of foreign currency contracts. The Company s translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into United States dollars may be partially hedged from time to time. The Company s most significant translation exposures are the Euro, the British pound and the Brazilian real in relation to the United States dollar and the Swiss franc in relation to the Euro. When practical, the translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings. 
    
  The Company uses floating rate and fixed rate debt to finance its operations. The floating rate debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes in the EURIBOR and LIBOR benchmark interest rates. The Company believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments, and to meet that objective, the Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with the Company s borrowings.  The Company designates interest rate contracts used to convert the interest rate exposure on a portion of the Company s debt portfolio from a floating rate to a fixed rate as cash flow hedges, while those contracts converting the Company s interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating rate are designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  The Company s senior management establishes the Company s foreign currency and interest rate risk management policies. These policies are reviewed periodically by the Finance Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. The policies allow for the use of derivative instruments to hedge exposures to movements in foreign currency and interest rates. The Company s policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes. 
    
  Counterparty Risk 
    
  The Company regularly monitors the counterparty risk and credit ratings of all the counterparties to the derivative instruments. The Company believes that its exposures are appropriately diversified across counterparties and that these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions. If the Company perceives any risk with a counterparty, then the Company would cease to do business with that counterparty. There have been no negative impacts to the Company from any non-performance of any counterparties.

Derivative Transactions Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  Foreign Currency Contracts 
    
  During   2016   and   2015  , the Company designated certain foreign currency contracts as cash flow hedges of expected future sales and purchases. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges were recorded in other comprehensive loss and were subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold during the period the sales and purchases were recognized. These amounts offset the effect of the changes in foreign currency rates on the related sale and purchase transactions. The amount of the net (gain) loss recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) that was reclassified into cost of goods sold during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $(0.3) million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, on an after-tax basis. The Company had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a notional amount of approximately   $56.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   that were entered into to hedge forecasted sale and purchase transactions. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   outstanding foreign currency contracts. The outstanding contracts as of   September 30, 2016   range in maturity through December 2016.  
    
  Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
    
  Cash Flow Hedge       
    
  During the third quarter of   2015  , the Company entered into an interest rate swap instrument with a notional amount of    312.0 million   (or approximately   $350.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) and an expiration date of June 26, 2020. The swap was designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Under the swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of   0.33%   plus the applicable margin, and the counterparty to the agreement pays a floating interest rate based on the three-month EURIBOR.  
    
  Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). These amounts are subsequently reclassified into  Interest expense, net  as a rate adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the Company s floating rate term loan facility affects earnings. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective portion of the unrealized change in fair value, net of tax, was a loss of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively, which was recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. For both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effective portion of the unrealized change in fair value, net of tax, was a loss of approximately   $1.5 million  , which was recorded in other comprehensive loss. The amount of the net loss recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income that was reclassified into  Interest expense, net  during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $0.5 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, on an after-tax basis. The amount of the net loss recorded in other comprehensive loss that was reclassified into  Interest expense, net  during both the   three and nine   months ended    September 30, 2015   was approximately   $0.1 million   on an after-tax basis. There was   no   ineffectiveness during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Fair Value Hedge 
       
  During the third quarter of   2015  , the Company entered into an interest rate swap instrument with a notional amount of   $300.0 million   and an expiration date of December 1, 2021 designated as a fair value hedge of the Company s 5   7   /  8  % senior notes (Note 6). Under the interest rate swap, the Company paid a floating interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus a spread of   4.14%   and the counterparty to the agreement paid a fixed interest rate of 5   7   /  8  %. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were recorded to  Interest expense, net  and offset changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged 5   7   /  8  % senior notes.  
    
  During the second quarter of   2016  , the Company terminated the existing interest rate swap transaction and received cash proceeds of approximately   $7.3 million  . The resulting gain was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction to  Interest expense, net  over the remaining term of the Company s 5   7   /  8  % senior notes through December 1, 2021. Refer to Note 6 for further information.

The following table summarizes the activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the derivatives held by the Company during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in millions): 

Net Investment Hedges 
    
  The Company uses non-derivative and, from time to time, derivative instruments, to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures ineffectiveness on these derivatives based on changes in forward rates.  
    
  For instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, to offset changes in the value of the net investments being hedged. When the net investment in foreign operations is sold or substantially liquidates, the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is dedesignated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated debt are recorded in earnings through the maturity date.  
    
  During   2015  , the Company designated its    312.0 million   (or approximately   $350.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ) term loan facility with a maturity date of June 26, 2020 as a hedge of its net investment in foreign operations to offset foreign currency translation gains or losses on the net investment. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $4.3 million   of foreign currency losses were included in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.       
    
  There was   no   ineffectiveness with respect to the net investment hedge discussed above during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
           
  Derivative Transactions Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  During   2016   and   2015  , the Company entered into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge receivables and payables on the Company and its subsidiaries  balance sheets that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. These contracts were classified as non-designated derivative instruments. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a notional amount of approximately   $1,724.9 million   and   $1,533.9 million  , respectively, that were entered into to economically hedge receivables and payables that were denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in  Other expense, net.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a net gain of less than   $0.1 million   and approximately   $14.3 million  , respectively, within  Other expense, net  within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to these contracts. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a net loss of approximately   $6.5 million   and   $46.8 million  , respectively, within  Other expense, net  within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to these contracts. Gains and losses on such contracts are substantially offset by losses and gains on the remeasurement of the underlying asset or liability being hedged.

Share Repurchase Program 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase ( ASR )agreements with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of   $170.0 million   of shares of the Company s common stock.  The Company received approximately   3,201,161   shares during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the ASR agreements. All shares received under the ASR agreements were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to  Additional paid-in capital  within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  The remaining amount of shares authorized to be repurchased under approved share repurchase programs is approximately   $73.9 million  .

13.    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES AGREEMENTS  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had accounts receivable sales agreements that permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of its wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to its U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements was approximately   $1.1 billion  .  
    
  Under the terms of the accounts receivable agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil, the Company pays an annual servicing fee related to the servicing of the receivables sold. The Company also pays the respective AGCO Finance entities a subsidized interest payment with respect to the sales agreements, calculated based upon LIBOR plus a margin on any non-interest bearing accounts receivable outstanding and sold under the sales agreements. These fees were reflected within losses on the sales of receivables included within  Other expense, net  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not service the receivables after the sale occurs and does not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. The Company reviewed its accounting for the accounts receivable sales agreements and determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. 
  Losses on sales of receivables associated with the accounts receivable financing facilities discussed above, reflected within  Other expense, net  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately   $4.3 million   and   $13.8 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Losses on sales of receivables associated with the accounts receivable financing facilities discussed above, reflected within  Other expense, net  in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately   $4.0 million   and   $13.4 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Company s finance joint ventures in Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to the Company s dealers. The receivables associated with these arrangements are without recourse to the Company. The Company does not service the receivables after the sale occurs and does not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. As of      September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these finance joint ventures had approximately   $27.8 million   and   $17.7 million  , respectively, of outstanding accounts receivable associated with these arrangements. The Company reviewed its accounting for these arrangements and determined that these arrangements should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. 
    
  In addition, the Company sells certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. The Company reviewed the sale of such receivables and determined that these arrangements should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.

The following table summarizes the activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Company s defined pension and postretirement benefit plans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in millions): 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $24.1 million   of contributions had been made to the Company s defined pension benefit plans. The Company currently estimates its minimum contributions for   2016   to its defined pension benefit plans will aggregate approximately   $31.6 million  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made approximately   $1.3 million   of contributions to its postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans. The Company currently estimates that it will make approximately   $1.5 million   of contributions to its postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans during   2016  .

15.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
    The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the assumptions used in valuing the asset or liability. Estimates of fair value for financial assets and liabilities are based on a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:  
    
  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
    
  Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
    
  Level 3 - Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.  
    
  The Company categorizes its pension plan assets into one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company enters into foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts. The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using discounted cash flow valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these discounted cash flow valuation models for derivative instruments include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates or interest rates. Such models used for option contracts also use implied volatility. See Note 11 for a discussion of the Company s derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
    
  The Company s trading securities as of   December 31, 2015   consisted of foreign-based government bonds. The fair value of the Company s investments in trading securities classified as Level 2 were priced using nonbinding market prices that were corroborated by observable market data.  
       
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized below (in millions):  

The carrying amounts of long-term debt under the Company s 1.056% senior term loan, credit facility, senior term loan  due 2021 and 5   7   /  8  % senior notes (Note 6) approximate fair value based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms and average maturities.

16.    SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  The Company s   four   reportable segments distribute a full range of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts. The Company evaluates segment performance primarily based on income (loss) from operations. Sales for each segment are based on the location of the third-party customer. The Company s selling, general and administrative expenses and engineering expenses are charged to each segment based on the region and division where the expenses are incurred. As a result, the components of income (loss) from operations for one segment may not be comparable to another segment. Segment results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   based on the Company s reportable segments are as follows (in millions):

17.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Guarantees 
    
  The Company maintains a remarketing agreement with its U.S. finance joint venture, whereby the Company is obligated to repurchase repossessed inventory at market values. The Company has an agreement with its U.S. finance joint venture, AGCO Finance LLC, which limits the Company s purchase obligations under this arrangement to   $6.0 million   in the aggregate per calendar year. The Company believes that any losses that might be incurred on the resale of this equipment will not materially impact the Company s financial position or results of operations due to the fair value of the underlying equipment. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has outstanding guarantees of indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately   $13.7 million  , primarily related to dealer and end-user financing of equipment. Such guarantees generally obligate the Company to repay outstanding finance obligations owed to financial institutions if dealers or end users default on such loans through   2020  . The Company believes the credit risk associated with these guarantees is not material to its financial position or results of operations. Losses under such guarantees have historically been insignificant. In addition, the Company generally would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of the amounts paid under such guarantees from the sale of the underlying financed farm equipment, as the fair value of such equipment is expected to be sufficient to offset a substantial portion of the amounts paid. 
    
  Other 
    
  The Company sells a majority of its wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to its U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The Company also sells certain accounts receivable under factoring arrangements to financial institutions around the world. The Company reviewed the sale of such receivables and determined that these facilities should be accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions.

Legal Claims and Other Matters 
    
  In August 2008, as part of routine audits, the Brazilian taxing authorities disallowed deductions relating to the amortization of certain goodwill recognized in connection with a reorganization of the Company s Brazilian operations and the related transfer of certain assets to the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries. The amount of the tax disallowance through   September 30, 2016  , not including interest and penalties, was approximately   131.5 million   Brazilian reais (or approximately   $40.4 million  ). The amount ultimately in dispute will be greater because of interest and penalties. The Company has been advised by its legal and tax advisors that its position with respect to the deductions is allowable under the tax laws of Brazil. The Company is contesting the disallowance and believes that it is not likely that the assessment, interest or penalties will be required to be paid. However, the ultimate outcome will not be determined until the Brazilian tax appeal process is complete, which could take several years. 
    
  The Company is a party to various other legal claims and actions incidental to its business. The Company believes that none of these claims or actions, either individually or in the aggregate, is material to its business or financial statements as a whole, including its results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL 
  Our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. Sales of our equipment are affected by changes in net cash farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity prices and general economic conditions. We record sales when we sell equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers, distributors and other customers. To the extent possible, we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventories. However, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are a function of the timing of the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, our net sales have historically been the lowest in the first quarter and have increased in subsequent quarters. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated net income of   $40.0 million  , or   $0.50   per share, compared to net income of   $67.1 million  , or   $0.77   per share, for the same period in   2015  .  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , we generated net income of   $98.1 million  , or   $1.20   per share, compared to net income of   $204.3 million  , or   $2.33   per share, for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Net sales during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,761.6 million   which were approximately   1.5%   higher than the same period in   2015   primarily due to the benefit of net sales from new acquisitions, largely offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Net sales during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $5,316.5 million   which were approximately   3.5%   lower than the same period in the prior year primarily due to weaker global market conditions and the negative impact of foreign currency translation. 
    
  Income from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $59.0 million   compared to   $79.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . Income from operations was   $197.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    compared to   $275.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in income from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower production levels and a weaker sales mix compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in income from operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower net sales and production levels, a weaker product mix and the negative impact of currency translation compared to the same prior year period.  
    
  Regionally, income from operations in our Europe/Africa/Middle East ( EAME ) region increased in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . Higher net sales helped to bolster operating income in the region, which was partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. In the North American region, a decline in net sales and production volumes coupled with a weaker sales mix negatively impacted income from operations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . Income from operations in our South American region also decreased in both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to lower sales and production volumes, material cost inflation and the negative impact of currency translation. The operating results in our Asia/Pacific region improved in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to higher net sales and production levels in China. 
    
  Industry Market Conditions 
  Growing global grain stocks have resulted in lower prices for all major agricultural commodities, which negatively impacts farm income. As a result of more challenging farm economics, industry demand continued to soften in all major agricultural equipment markets during the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to the first   nine   months of 2015. 
       
  In North America, industry unit retail sales of utility and high horsepower tractors for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased by approximately 11% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . Industry unit retail sales of combines for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased by approximately 20% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . Retail sales were significantly lower for high horsepower tractors, sprayers and combines, partially offset by stable retail sales for smaller and mid-sized tractors.   
    
  In Western Europe, industry unit retail sales of tractors for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased slightly by approximately 1% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . Industry unit retail sales of combines for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased by approximately 11% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . Difficult economic conditions for dairy

  (continued) 

producers and lower commodity prices in the arable farming sector negatively impacted market demand across Western Europe, with declines most pronounced in Germany and the United Kingdom.  
    
  South American industry unit retail sales of tractors in the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased approximately 16% compared to the same period in   2015  . Industry unit retail sales of combines for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased by approximately 5% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decline in the first nine months of 2016 was most pronounced in Brazil, where political uncertainty and the depressed general economy negatively impacted industry retail sales. However, the improving political landscape during the third quarter of 2016 in Brazil resulted in industry growth from third quarter 2015 depressed levels. 

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,761.6 million   compared to   $1,736.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $5,316.5 million   compared to   $5,508.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by approximately   $20.2 million  , or   1.2%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and by approximately   $160.1 million  , or   2.9%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following tables sets forth, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the impact to net sales of currency translation by geographical segment (in millions, except percentages): 

Regionally, net sales in North America decreased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . Decreases in net sales of high horsepower tractors, grain storage and handling equipment, as well as hay tools, were partially offset by net sales growth in low and mid-size horsepower tractors. In the EAME region, net sales increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  .  Higher net sales during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   in France and Scandinavia were partially offset by net sales declines in Germany and Africa. Net sales in South America increased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to increased sales in Brazil as a result of improved market demand. Net sales in South America decreased during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to significant sales declines in the first half of of 2016 in Brazil, which were partially offset by growth in Argentina. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase in net sales during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by net sales growth in China. We estimate worldwide average price increases were approximately 1.3% and 1.2% during the

  (continued) 

three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Consolidated net sales of tractors and combines, which comprised approximately 58% and 60% of our net sales in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, increased approximately 3% and decreased approximately 3% in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Unit sales of tractors and combines increased approximately 5% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . Unit sales of tractors and combines decreased approximately 3% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The difference between the unit sales change and the change in net sales was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, pricing and sales mix changes.  
       
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions, except percentages): 

____________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Rounding may impact summation of amounts. 
       
  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . The impact of lower net sales and production levels as well as a weaker product mix were partially offset by benefits from material cost containment and productivity initiatives. Production hours decreased approximately 10% and 9% for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   respectively compared to the same periods in   2015  . We recorded approximately   $0.7 million   and   $1.6 million   of stock compensation expense within cost of goods sold during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  , respectively, as is more fully explained below and in Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses and engineering expenses combined remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . Engineering spending increased for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to support investments in future new product introductions.  We recorded approximately   $7.2 million   and   $18.0 million   of stock compensation expense within SG A expenses during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $3.2 million   and   $10.1 million   during the same periods in   2015  , as is more fully explained in Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

  (continued) 

The restructuring expenses of    $1.5 million   and   $5.5 million   recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were primarily related to severance and other related costs associated with the rationalization of certain manufacturing operations and administrative offices located in Europe, South America and the United States. Refer to Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  Interest expense, net was approximately   $12.1 million   and   $34.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to approximately   $10.6 million   and   $32.1 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to lower interest income during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  Other income, net was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $2.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Other expense, net was approximately   $27.1 million   and   $17.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in other income, net during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily a result of slightly lower foreign exchange gains compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in other expense, net during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily a result of higher foreign exchange losses compared to the same period in   2015  . Losses on sales of receivables, primarily related to our accounts receivable sales agreements with our finance joint ventures in North America, Europe and Brazil, were approximately   $4.3 million   and   $13.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to approximately   $4.0 million   and   $13.4 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  . 
    
  We recorded an income tax provision of approximately   $19.5 million   and   $73.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to an income tax provision of approximately   $17.6 million   and   $66.1 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  . Our effective tax rate varies from period to period due to the mix of taxable income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a non-cash deferred tax adjustment of approximately   $31.6 million   to establish a valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred income tax assets for previous periods. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determined that the adjustment to the valuation allowance at   September 30, 2016   was appropriate. In making this assessment, all available evidence was considered including the current economic climate, as well as reasonable tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our remaining deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, in future years.  
    
  Equity in net earnings of affiliates, which is primarily comprised of income from our finance joint ventures, was approximately   $11.8 million   and   $37.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to approximately   $14.2 million   and   $42.3 million   for the comparable periods in   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to lower net earnings from certain finance joint ventures and other affiliates. Refer to  Finance Joint Ventures  for further information regarding our finance joint ventures and their results of operations. 
    
  RECENT ACQUISITION 
    
    On September 12, 2016, we acquired Cimbria Holdings Limited (Cimbria) for   DKK 2,234.9 million   (or approximately   $337.5 million  ), net of cash acquired of approximately   DKK 83.4 million   (or approximately   $12.6 million  ). Cimbria, headquartered in Thisted, Denmark, is a leading manufacturer of products and solutions for the processing, handling and storage of seed and grain. The acquisition was financed by our credit facility, which was subsequently refinanced in October 2016 through a group of related term loan agreements (Note 6). We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of their fair values as of the acquisition date. The acquired net assets primarily consisted of accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses, property, plant and equipment, deferred tax liabilities, and customer relationship, technology and trademark identifiable intangible assets. We recorded approximately   $128.9 million   of customer relationship, technology and trademark identifiable intangible assets and approximately   $237.8 million   of goodwill associated with the acquisition.

FINANCE JOINT VENTURES 
  Our AGCO Finance joint ventures provide both retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Europe, Argentina and Australia. The joint ventures are owned 49% by AGCO and 51% by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Co peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. ( Rabobank ), a financial institution based in the Netherlands. The majority of the assets of the finance joint ventures represent finance receivables. The majority of the liabilities represent notes payable and accrued interest. Under the various joint venture agreements, Rabobank or its affiliates provide financing to the joint ventures, primarily through lines of credit. We do not guarantee the debt obligations of the joint ventures.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital investment in the finance joint ventures, which is included in  Investment in affiliates  on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was approximately $402.1 million compared to $359.4 million as of   December 31, 2015  . The total finance portfolio in our finance joint ventures was approximately $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The total finance portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   included approximately $6.9 billion of retail receivables and $1.3 billion of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. The total finance portfolio as of   December 31, 2015   included approximately $6.7 billion of retail receivables and $1.3 billion of wholesale receivables from AGCO dealers. The wholesale receivables either were sold directly to AGCO Finance without recourse from our operating companies or AGCO Finance provided the financing directly to the dealers. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our share in the earnings of the finance joint ventures, included in  Equity in net earnings of affiliates  within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $36.8 million compared to $39.4 million for the same period in   2015  .     

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels. Internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources, primarily our credit facility and accounts receivable sales agreement facilities. We believe that the following facilities and our new term loan agreements discussed below, together with available cash and internally generated funds, will be sufficient to support our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future (in millions): 

In addition, while we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in these facilities and currently expect to continue to maintain such compliance, should we ever encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our lenders has been strong and we anticipate their continued long-term support of our business. Refer to Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our current facilities.  
    
  On October 19, 2016, we borrowed an aggregate amount of    375.0 million   through a group of seven related term loan agreements. The    375.0 million   (or approximately   $411.5 million   as of October 19, 2016) was used to repay borrowings made under our revolving credit facility, which funded the acquisition of Cimbria (refer to Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We received net proceeds of approximately    373.2 million   (or approximately   $409.5 million   as of October 19, 2016) after debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the term loan agreements.  
    
  Our accounts receivable sales agreements in North America, Europe and Brazil permit the sale, on an ongoing basis, of a majority of our receivables to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. The sales of all receivables are without recourse to us. We do not service the receivables after the sale occurs, and we do not maintain any direct retained interest in the receivables. These agreements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions and have the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short-term liabilities by the same amount. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cash received from receivables sold under the U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian accounts receivable sales agreements was approximately   $1.1 billion  .  
    
  Our finance joint ventures in Brazil and Australia also provide wholesale financing directly to our dealers. The receivables associated with these arrangements are also without recourse to us. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these finance joint ventures had approximately   $27.8 million   and   $17.7 million  , respectively, of outstanding accounts  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (continued) 

receivable associated with these arrangements. These arrangements are accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. In addition, we sell certain trade receivables under factoring arrangements to other financial institutions around the world. These arrangements are also accounted for as off-balance sheet transactions. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash flows used in operating activities were approximately   $127.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately   $72.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Our working capital requirements are seasonal, with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year. We had   $1,271.1 million   in working capital at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $712.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   and $1,288.3 million at   September 30, 2015  . Accounts receivable and inventories, combined, at   September 30, 2016   were   $576.6 million   and   $190.8 million   higher than at   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increase in accounts receivable and inventories as of   September 30, 2016   compared to the previous periods was primarily the result of acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.  
    
  Capital expenditures for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $132.8 million   compared to   $147.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . We anticipate that capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 will be approximately $250.0 million and will primarily be used to support the development and enhancement of new and existing products, upgrade our system capabilities and improve our factory productivity.  
    
  Our debt to capitalization ratio, which is total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness and stockholders  equity, was 40.2% and 30.0% at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The increase is primarily due to the additional indebtedness related to the financing of the Cimbria acquisition as well as the impact of our share repurchases discussed below.  
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) agreements with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of   $170.0 million   of shares of our common stock.  We received approximately   3,201,161   shares during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the ASR agreements.  All shares received under the ASR agreements were retired upon receipt, and the excess of the purchase price over par value per share was recorded to  Additional paid-in capital  within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  The remaining amount of shares authorized to be repurchased under approved share repurchase programs is approximately   $73.9 million  . 

COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We are party to a number of commitments and other financial arrangements, which may include  off-balance sheet  arrangements. At   September 30, 2016  , we have outstanding guarantees of indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately   $13.7 million  , primarily related to dealer and end-user financing of equipment. We also sell a majority of our wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures. At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding designated and non-designated foreign currency contracts with a gross notional amount of approximately   $1,781.1 million  . Refer to  Liquidity and Capital Resources  and  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk Management,  as well as to Notes 11, 13 and 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of these matters. 
    
  Contingencies 
    
  As part of routine audits, the Brazilian taxing authorities disallowed deductions relating to the amortization of certain goodwill recognized in connection with a reorganization of our Brazilian operations and the related transfer of certain assets to our Brazilian subsidiaries.  
    
  Refer to Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these matters.

OUTLOOK 
  Industry demand for farm equipment is expected to weaken in all major markets for the full year of   2016   compared to 2015 resulting from lower commodity prices and reduced farm income levels. Our net sales in   2016   are expected to decrease compared to   2015  , primarily due to the projected industry decline and unfavorable currency translation impacts partially offset by the impact of acquisition-related sales. Income from operations and net income are expected to be below   2015   levels due to the negative impact of lower sales and production volumes along with a weaker product mix. Benefits from our cost reduction initiatives are expected to partially offset the volume-related impacts.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including those related to reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, derivative financial instruments and contingencies. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description of critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain statements in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking, including certain statements set forth under the headings  Liquidity and Capital Resources  and  Outlook.   Forward-looking statements reflect assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events. These statements, which may relate to such matters as earnings, net sales, margins, industry demand, market conditions, commodity prices, farm incomes, foreign currency translation, general economic outlook, availability of financing, product development and enhancement, system capabilities and factory productivity, production and sales volumes,  benefits from cost reduction initiatives, tax rates, compliance with loan covenants, capital expenditures and working capital and debt service requirements are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and you can identify certain of these statements, but not necessarily all, by the use of the words  anticipate,   assumed,   indicate,   estimate,   believe,   predict,   forecast,   rely,   expect,   continue,   grow  and other words of similar meaning. Although we believe that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these statements are reasonable in view of the information currently available to us, there can be no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct. 
    
  These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Adverse changes in any of the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements: 

general economic and capital market conditions; 
                  
    availability of credit to our retail customers; 
                  
    the worldwide demand for agricultural products; 
                  
    grain stock levels and the levels of new and used field inventories; 
            cost of steel and other raw materials; 
         energy costs; 
         performance and collectability of the accounts receivable originated or owned by AGCO or AGCO Finance; 
               
    government policies and subsidies; 
                  
    weather conditions; 
                  
    interest and foreign currency exchange rates;

farm income, land values, debt levels and access to credit; 
                  
    pervasive livestock diseases; 
                  
    production disruptions; 
                  
    production levels and capacity constraints at our facilities, including those resulting from plant expansions and systems upgrades; 
                  
    integration of recent and future acquisitions; 
                  
    our expansion plans in emerging markets; 
                  
    supply constraints; 
                  
    our cost reduction and control initiatives; 
                  
    our research and development efforts; 
                  
    dealer and distributor actions; 
                  
    regulations affecting privacy and data protection; 
                  
    technological difficulties; and 
                  
    political and economic uncertainty in various areas of the world. 
     Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of such important factors. For additional factors and additional information regarding these factors, please see  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the year ended               December 31, 2015  . 
    
  O  n June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as  Brexit.   As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U.  Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries, increased regulatory complexities, and increased currency volatility, any of which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. 
    
  New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described above emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors or the extent to which any such factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we disclaim any obligation to update the information contained in such statement to reflect subsequent developments or information except as required by law.

    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
       
  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  in Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . As of the   third   quarter of   2016  , there has been no material change in our exposure to market risks.       

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of   September 30, 2016  , have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls or the Company s internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We will conduct periodic evaluations of our internal controls to enhance, where necessary, our procedures and controls. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     We are a party to various other legal claims and actions incidental to our business. These items are more fully discussed in Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
     Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The table below sets forth information with respect to purchases of our common stock made by or on behalf of us during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)    Our Board of Directors  authorization to repurchase these shares expires in December 2016. 
    
   (2)    In August 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $50.0 million of shares of our common stock. The ASR agreement resulted in the initial delivery of 851,426 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 80% of the shares expected to be repurchased in connection with the transaction. The ASR agreement is expected to be completed no later than the fourth quarter of 2016. The average price paid per share for the ASR agreement reflected in the table above was derived using the fair market value of the shares on the date the initial 851,426 shares were delivered. The amount that may yet be purchased under our share repurchase programs, as presented in the above table, was reduced by the entire $50.0 million payment. Refer to Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this matter.

Above that the Paying Agent acts solely as agent of the Borrower and the Guarantor and does not have any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust to any Lender. 
        
      (7)        Subject to the aforementioned provisions of this   4, fulfilment in relation to the Lender shall only occur once it receives the relevant payments or these are credited to an account it has designated.

If the Borrower or the Guarantor is required by law to make such withholding or deduction, then the Borrower or the Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts (the "  Additional Amounts  ") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Lender after such deduction or withholding shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest which would have been receivable under the Loan Agreement in the absence of such deduction or withholding. The 

~ 7 ~ 

foregoing does not apply to the extent any such withholding or deduction is attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a party to this Loan Agreement. 
        
      (2)        A payment shall not be increased pursuant to this   5 if and to the extent that on the date on which the payment falls due: (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender (which is not a Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank Lender) without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Bank, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Bank other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Loan Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (ii) the Borrower is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under   10. 
        
      (3)        If (i) as a consequence of any amendments of the legal regulations valid in the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat that take effect on the date of this Loan Agreement or thereafter, Withholding Taxes regarding payments of principal or interest under the Loan need to be made (and cannot be avoided despite the Borrower and the Lender having made every reasonable effort to prevent such a situation) and (ii) the Borrower or the Guarantor is obliged to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to   5 para. 1 of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to repay the Loan on giving not less than (30) days  prior notice, either at the aggregate principal amount thereof or at the partial amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender, in each case with interest accrued to the date fixed for prepayment.   Any such notice of prepayment shall not be effected earlier then ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the Borrower or the Guarantor first becomes obliged to make Additional Payments pursuant to   5 para 1.  Any such notice of prepayment in accordance with this   5 para. 2 shall be given in writing and shall be addressed to the Lender (via the Paying Agent). Such notice will be irrevocable and must specify the date fixed for prepayment. The Paying Agent shall immediately inform the Lenders about such notice of prepayment. The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for any loss incurred by the latter as a result of the premature repayment (early repayment penalty). 
        
      For the avoidance of doubt: any prepayments on the income or corporate income tax made by the Lender such as the German flat rate interest tax (Abgeltungssteuer and Zinsertragssteuer) do not constitute withholding taxes within the meaning of the provision above. 
        
        6 Increased Costs 
        
      If - after the date hereof - by reason of introduction or change of the interpretation or application by the respective competent authority with respect to any law or regulation or compliance with any law or regulation (except for such laws and regulations which have been in force as of the date of this Loan Agreement and with which the respective Lender was not in compliance as of the date hereof), there is (a) any substantial increase in the costs for a Lender to fund or maintain the Loan or (b) a reduction in the rate of return on the Loan or a decrease in the net return on the Loan in relation to the equity of the respective Lender, then the affected Lender, the Guarantor and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations with the aim of finding an acceptable solution for the Parties.

      (k)   the Guarantee is not or ceases to be in full force and effect. 
        
      (2)   The Borrower or the Guarantor shall promptly notify the Paying Agent in writing who in turn will promptly inform the Lender on all matters which could lead to any event of default as set out in   8 para. 1. Notices of termination have to be provided in writing to the Borrower with a copy to the Paying Agent and the Guarantor.

        9 Guarantee 
        
      (1)   The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees in favour of the Lender subject to German law to pay to the Lender all present and future claims (whether contingent or subject to a time limit) of the Lender under this Loan Agreement against the Borrower. The payment shall be due pay within five (5) Business Days of a written demand by the Lender and assertion that the Borrower has failed to pay an amount payable under the Loan when due.   4 shall apply on the payments under the Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Guarantee does not constitute a guarantee upon first demand (  Garantie auf erstes Anfordern  ) and, in particular, receipt of such written demand shall not preclude any rights and/or defenses the Guarantor may have with respect to any payment requested by the Lender under this guarantee and indemnity. 
        
      (2)   This Guarantee is an independent payment obligation of the Guarantor which shall remain binding irrespective of the legal validity and enforceability of the Loan Agreement and notwithstanding any defenses or remedies (  Einwendungen und Einreden  ) that the Borrower or any third party may raise. 
        
      (3)   The Guarantee shall terminate once all amounts due under the Loan Agreement have been unconditionally and finally paid. 
  Notwithstanding the termination, the Guarantee shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect if the Lender has to repay any amounts received as a payment under  the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee due to insolvency proceedings before court or any similar proceedings regarding the Borrower. 
        
      (4)   Until all amounts which are or may become payable by the Guarantor under this Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, (i) any claims of the Guarantor against the Borrower resulting from any payment made by the Guarantor to the Lender hereunder shall be subordinated to any outstanding claims of the Lender against the Borrower under this Loan Agreement, and (ii) the 

~ 11 ~ 

Guarantor undertakes not to claim any payments from the Borrower arising out of or based upon any right of subrogation. 
        
      (5)   The Guarantor hereby waives its rights to terminate the Guarantee by depositing the guarantee amount with the competent local court (  Amtsgericht  ) by way of security. 
        
        10 Transfer 
        
      (1)   The Lender may transfer its contractual position hereunder (including those under the Guarantee) in full or in partial amounts of at least EUR 500,000 and in whole multiples of EUR 500,000 above that - to a Third Party by way of assumption of contract.  
        
      (a)    In case of the first transfer of the contractual position by the First Lender the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   A transfer to a Lender which is not a Qualifying Bank is subject to the consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. It is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. 
        
      Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Loan Agreement as if it is not a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (ii)   The transfer will be effected by a confirmation of transaction (  Gesch ftsbest tigung  ) to be issued by the First Lender and countersigned by the joining Lender. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay.  
        
      (b)    For all following transfers of the contractual position the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender which does not meet the definition of a Qualifying Bank is only permitted with the prior written consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; in particular it is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall not be treated as a Qualifying Bank for the purposes of this Loan Agreement. 
        
      (ii)   Such transfer shall become effective as of the transfer date set forth in the Transfer Certificate (Annex 3), provided that the Paying Agent has received a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Certificate substantially in the form set out in the example in Annex 3. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay by submitting a copy of the relevant Transfer Certificate. 
        
      (iii)    In the event that the Paying Agent receives a Transfer Certificate less than five (5) Banking Days before an Interest Payment Date, any payment made by the Borrower or the 

~ 12 ~ 

Guarantor to the resigning Lender shall release the Borrower from its payment obligations to the joining Lender in the amount of such payment. 
        
      (2)    Each Lender which confirmed that it was a Qualifying Bank undertakes to notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent promptly upon becoming aware of it ceasing to be a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (3)    The result of a transfer is that all of the resigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement and the Guarantee are passed over to the joining Lender to the extent that they are transferred. The effect of a transfer is that the existing Loan Agreement and the Guarantee remain unchanged in force between the new contract parties to the extent that rights and obligations are transferred. 
        
      (4)   By signing this Loan Agreement, the Borrower grants its prior consent to any such transfer made in compliance with   10 (1). 
        
      (5)   The Lender shall be authorized to transfer all its claims under this Loan (incl. those under the Guarantee) to the Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque Centrale du Luxembourg or any other central bank of the ECB system or to the Swiss National Bank or any eurozone development bank ("  F rderbank  ") as security for refinancing purposes. For the validity of such transfer expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. Likewise, in case of such transfers being made by any central bank of the ECB system or eurozone development bank expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. In case of the liquidation of any rights arising out of this Loan Agreement by any central bank of the ECB system, the restrictions under   10(1)shall not apply. 
        
      (6)   For the purposes of this   10, the Borrower and the Guarantor hereby give their consent to the forwarding of all information contained in this Loan Agreement to joining Lenders or potentially joining Lenders (including any relevant data such joining Lender or potentially joining Lender may require for purposes of section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or in order to meet any other "know your customer" requirements (the "  KYC Data  ")), the respective central bank or development bank for such transfer and, if applicable, to third parties acquiring the participation from beneficiaries to whom a transfer in accordance with   10 (5) has been made in case of an enforcement of such a security. Such consent shall also extend to measures of publication (e.g. recording the security in a register that authorised third parties have access to) which are required by law for the constitution or consistency of such a security and they exempt the Lender from the banking confidentiality in this respect. 
        
      (7)   No Lender shall enter into a sub-participation arrangement with another person or assign any rights or claims under this Loan Agreement without transferring the relevant contractual position at the same time and to the same transferee. The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender (i) which does not meet the definition of a Third Party or (ii) is a private individual is not permitted. 
        
        11 Nature of a Lender's Rights and Obligations 
        
      (1)   The obligations of a Lender under this Loan Agreement are not joint and several (keine gesamtschuldnerische Haftung). No Lender is liable for the obligations of any other Lender under the Loan Agreement. 
        
      (2)   The rights of a Lender under this Loan Agreement (and under the Guarantee) are not joint and several (keine Gesamtgl ubiger). The amounts owed at any time under the Loan Agreement from the Borrower to any Lender shall constitute a separate and independent debt and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Loan Agreement and out of the Guarantee independently from another Lender.

~ 6 ~ 

(2)        If any sum of principal is not paid to and available on the account of the Paying Agent by 12:00 (Munich time) when due, the Paying Agent shall not be obliged to forward the due amount to the Lender on the same day. The respective sum shall bear interest from (and including) the due date to (but excluding) the date of actual payment of the sum overdue at a rate of 1 per cent per annum above the rate of interest applicable to the Loan on the respective due date without prejudice to the right of the Lender to claim any further damages and without prejudice to the right of the Borrower to present evidence that the loss due to the late payment was less. 
        
      (3)        If an interest payment is not made to the account of the Paying Agent by 12:00 (Munich time) when due, the Paying Agent shall not be obliged to forward the due amount to the Lender on the same day. The Lender has the right to demand indemnification for the loss caused by the delay in payment. 
        
      (4)        Payments by the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be applied in the sequence provided for in section 367 para. 1 of the German Civil Code (BGB) to the amounts falling due. If, in the event of a full or partial transfer of the contractual position pursuant to   10, the payments by the Borrower or the Guarantor are not sufficient to fully redeem any given amount due, the payments of the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be distributed among the Lenders on a pro rata basis in conformity with their relevant participations in the Loan. 
        
      (5)        By a separate agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantor have mandated Bayerische Landesbank to exercise the role of paying agent (Bayerische Landesbank shall hereinafter be referred to as "  Paying Agent  " with respect to the duties in connection with this role). The Paying Agent shall exercise this role in accordance with the paying agency agreement dated as of 12 October 2016. The Borrower together with the Guarantor may at any time mandate another Credit Institution in the Federal Republic of Germany to exercise the role of Paying Agent provided the Borrower informs the Paying Agent (with copy to the Lender) in writing two weeks in advance of the planned change. Any reference in this Loan Agreement to the "Paying Agent" shall include any further Credit Institutions that exercise the role of Paying Agent.  
        
      (6)        By order of the Borrower the Paying Agent acts as custodian for the Lenders (according to their respective partial amount of the Loan) with regard to the original certificate of Indebtedness (  Schuldschein  ). The custodianship of the Paying Agent shall end once the Lender s respective partial amount of the Loan has been repaid (including interest). Above that the Paying Agent acts solely as agent of the Borrower and the Guarantor and does not have any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust to any Lender. 
        
      (7)        Subject to the aforementioned provisions of this   4, fulfilment in relation to the Lender shall only occur once it receives the relevant payments or these are credited to an account it has designated. 
        
        5 Taxes 
        
      (1)        All payments of principal and interest under the Loan Agreement by the Borrower as well as those payable under the Guarantee by the Guarantor shall be made without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes or duties of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat or any governmental authority there ("  Withholding     Taxes  ") unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If the Borrower or the Guarantor is required by law to make such withholding or deduction, then the Borrower or the Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts (the "  Additional Amounts  ") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Lender after such deduction or withholding shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest which would have been receivable under the Loan Agreement in the absence of such deduction or withholding. The foregoing does not apply to the extent any such withholding or deduction is attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a party to this Loan Agreement. 

~ 7 ~ 

(2)        A payment shall not be increased pursuant to this   5 if and to the extent that on the date on which the payment falls due: (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender (which is not a Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank Lender) without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Bank, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Bank other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Loan Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (ii) the Borrower is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under   10. 
        
      (3)        If (i) as a consequence of any amendments of the legal regulations valid in the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat that take effect on the date of this Loan Agreement or thereafter, Withholding Taxes regarding payments of principal or interest under the Loan need to be made (and cannot be avoided despite the Borrower and the Lender having made every reasonable effort to prevent such a situation) and (ii) the Borrower or the Guarantor is obliged to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to   5 para. 1 of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to repay the Loan on giving not less than (30) days  prior notice, either at the aggregate principal amount thereof or at the partial amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender, in each case with interest accrued to the date fixed for prepayment.   Any such notice of prepayment shall not be effected earlier then ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the Borrower or the Guarantor first becomes obliged to make Additional Payments pursuant to   5 para 1.  Any such notice of prepayment in accordance with this   5 para. 2 shall be given in writing and shall be addressed to the Lender (via the Paying Agent). Such notice will be irrevocable and must specify the date fixed for prepayment. The Paying Agent shall immediately inform the Lenders about such notice of prepayment. The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for any loss incurred by the latter as a result of the premature repayment (early repayment penalty). 
        
      For the avoidance of doubt: any prepayments on the income or corporate income tax made by the Lender such as the German flat rate interest tax (Abgeltungssteuer and Zinsertragssteuer) do not constitute withholding taxes within the meaning of the provision above. 
        
        6 Increased Costs 
        
      If - after the date hereof - by reason of introduction or change of the interpretation or application by the respective competent authority with respect to any law or regulation or compliance with any law or regulation (except for such laws and regulations which have been in force as of the date of this Loan Agreement and with which the respective Lender was not in compliance as of the date hereof), there is (a) any substantial increase in the costs for a Lender to fund or maintain the Loan or (b) a reduction in the rate of return on the Loan or a decrease in the net return on the Loan in relation to the equity of the respective Lender, then the affected Lender, the Guarantor and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations with the aim of finding an acceptable solution for the Parties. 
        
        7 Negative Pledge, Status (pari passu), Non-Bank Rules

        9 Guarantee 
        
      (1)   The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees in favour of the Lender subject to German law to pay to the Lender all present and future claims (whether contingent or subject to a time limit) of the Lender under this Loan Agreement against the Borrower. The payment shall be due pay within five (5) Business Days of a written demand by the Lender and assertion that the Borrower has failed to pay an amount payable under the Loan when due.   4 shall apply on the payments under the Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Guarantee does not constitute a guarantee upon first demand (  Garantie auf erstes Anfordern  ) and, in particular, receipt of such written demand shall not preclude any rights and/or defenses the Guarantor may have with respect to any payment requested by the Lender under this guarantee and indemnity. 
        
      (2)   This Guarantee is an independent payment obligation of the Guarantor which shall remain binding irrespective of the legal validity and enforceability of the Loan Agreement and notwithstanding any defenses or remedies (  Einwendungen und Einreden  ) that the Borrower or any third party may raise. 
        
      (3)   The Guarantee shall terminate once all amounts due under the Loan Agreement have been unconditionally and finally paid. 
  Notwithstanding the termination, the Guarantee shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect if the Lender has to repay any amounts received as a payment under  the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee due to insolvency proceedings before court or any similar proceedings regarding the Borrower. 
        
      (4)   Until all amounts which are or may become payable by the Guarantor under this Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, (i) any claims of the Guarantor against the Borrower resulting from any payment made by the Guarantor to the Lender hereunder shall be subordinated to any outstanding claims of the Lender against the Borrower under this Loan Agreement, and (ii) the Guarantor undertakes not to claim any payments from the Borrower arising out of or based upon any right of subrogation. 

~ 11 ~ 

(5)   The Guarantor hereby waives its rights to terminate the Guarantee by depositing the guarantee amount with the competent local court (  Amtsgericht  ) by way of security. 
        
        10 Transfer 
        
      (1)   The Lender may transfer its contractual position hereunder (including those under the Guarantee) in full or in partial amounts of at least EUR 500,000 and in whole multiples of EUR 500,000 above that - to a Third Party by way of assumption of contract.  
        
      (a)    In case of the first transfer of the contractual position by the First Lender the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   A transfer to a Lender which is not a Qualifying Bank is subject to the consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. It is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. 
        
      Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Loan Agreement as if it is not a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (ii)   The transfer will be effected by a confirmation of transaction (  Gesch ftsbest tigung  ) to be issued by the First Lender and countersigned by the joining Lender. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay.  
        
      (b)    For all following transfers of the contractual position the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender which does not meet the definition of a Qualifying Bank is only permitted with the prior written consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; in particular it is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall not be treated as a Qualifying Bank for the purposes of this Loan Agreement. 
        
      (ii)   Such transfer shall become effective as of the transfer date set forth in the Transfer Certificate (Annex 3), provided that the Paying Agent has received a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Certificate substantially in the form set out in the example in Annex 3. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay by submitting a copy of the relevant Transfer Certificate. 
        
      (iii)    In the event that the Paying Agent receives a Transfer Certificate less than five (5) Banking Days before an Interest Payment Date, any payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the resigning Lender shall release the Borrower from its payment obligations to the joining Lender in the amount of such payment. 

~ 12 ~ 

(2)    Each Lender which confirmed that it was a Qualifying Bank undertakes to notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent promptly upon becoming aware of it ceasing to be a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (3)    The result of a transfer is that all of the resigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement and the Guarantee are passed over to the joining Lender to the extent that they are transferred. The effect of a transfer is that the existing Loan Agreement and the Guarantee remain unchanged in force between the new contract parties to the extent that rights and obligations are transferred. 
        
      (4)   By signing this Loan Agreement, the Borrower grants its prior consent to any such transfer made in compliance with   10 (1). 
        
      (5)   The Lender shall be authorized to transfer all its claims under this Loan (incl. those under the Guarantee) to the Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque Centrale du Luxembourg or any other central bank of the ECB system or to the Swiss National Bank or any eurozone development bank ("  F rderbank  ") as security for refinancing purposes. For the validity of such transfer expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. Likewise, in case of such transfers being made by any central bank of the ECB system or eurozone development bank expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. In case of the liquidation of any rights arising out of this Loan Agreement by any central bank of the ECB system, the restrictions under   10(1)shall not apply. 
        
      (6)   For the purposes of this   10, the Borrower and the Guarantor hereby give their consent to the forwarding of all information contained in this Loan Agreement to joining Lenders or potentially joining Lenders (including any relevant data such joining Lender or potentially joining Lender may require for purposes of section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or in order to meet any other "know your customer" requirements (the "  KYC Data  ")), the respective central bank or development bank for such transfer and, if applicable, to third parties acquiring the participation from beneficiaries to whom a transfer in accordance with   10 (5) has been made in case of an enforcement of such a security. Such consent shall also extend to measures of publication (e.g. recording the security in a register that authorised third parties have access to) which are required by law for the constitution or consistency of such a security and they exempt the Lender from the banking confidentiality in this respect. 
        
      (7)   No Lender shall enter into a sub-participation arrangement with another person or assign any rights or claims under this Loan Agreement without transferring the relevant contractual position at the same time and to the same transferee. The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender (i) which does not meet the definition of a Third Party or (ii) is a private individual is not permitted. 
        
        11 Nature of a Lender's Rights and Obligations 
        
      (1)   The obligations of a Lender under this Loan Agreement are not joint and several (keine gesamtschuldnerische Haftung). No Lender is liable for the obligations of any other Lender under the Loan Agreement. 
        
      (2)   The rights of a Lender under this Loan Agreement (and under the Guarantee) are not joint and several (keine Gesamtgl ubiger). The amounts owed at any time under the Loan Agreement from the Borrower to any Lender shall constitute a separate and independent debt and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Loan Agreement and out of the Guarantee independently from another Lender. 
        
        12 Information 
      (1)   For the purposes of complying with the requirements under section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG), the Borrower and the Guarantor shall submit in a timely manner to the Lender any 

~ 13 ~ 

documents and information required to comply with the Lender's statutory obligations. During the term of the Loan, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall in particular supply the following documents to the Paying Agent for submission to the Lenders: 
        
      (a)   the audited separate and consolidated (for the Guarantor) financial statements of the Borrower and the Guarantor as soon as they are publicly available but in any event no later than two hundred and seventy (270) days after the end of the respective financial year for the Borrower and no later than ninety (90) days after the end of the respective financial year for the Guarantor, for the latter subject to any extension period obtained by the Guarantor from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the filing of an equivalent periodic report under Rule 12b-25 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and 
        
      (b)   any other information a Lender may reasonably request in order to comply with legal requirements. 
        
      (2)   The obligation to disclose documents pursuant to   12 para. 1 shall cease to apply if the documents necessary to comply with section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or any other legal requirements are freely accessible on the Borrower's or Guarantor s website (in a form that can be saved or printed). 
        
      (3)   The Borrower and the Guarantor hereby authorize the Lender to pass on or to disclose for review any such documents, data and information as the Lender may consider necessary, useful or appropriate to any potential Third Party (or to a member of the European system of central banks or to the Swiss National Bank for the purposes set out in   10(4)or to such persons, who are involved in the settlement of the transfer for technical or legal reasons (such as legal advisors, rating agencies, auditors) or to governmental courts and authorities (especially supervisory authorities) that require disclosure by mandatory law, and therefore release the Lender from banking confidentiality. 
        
      (4)   Apart from that, the Parties, the Guarantor and the Paying Agent agree to treat information and documents received in connection with this Loan as confidential.  Legal or regulatory disclosure requirements that the Lender or Paying Agent are subject to remain unaffected.

      (4)        Payments by the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be applied in the sequence provided for in section 367 para. 1 of the German Civil Code (BGB) to the amounts falling due. If, in the event of a full or partial transfer of the contractual position pursuant to   10, the payments by the Borrower or the Guarantor are not sufficient to fully redeem any given amount due, the payments of the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be distributed among the Lenders on a pro rata basis in conformity with their relevant participations in the Loan. 
        
      (5)        By a separate agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantor have mandated Bayerische Landesbank to exercise the role of paying agent (Bayerische Landesbank shall hereinafter be referred to as "  Paying Agent  " with respect to the duties in connection with this role). The Paying Agent shall exercise this role in accordance with the paying agency agreement dated as of 12 October 2016. The Borrower together with the Guarantor may at any time mandate another Credit Institution in the Federal Republic of Germany to exercise the role of Paying Agent provided the Borrower informs the Paying Agent (with copy to the Lender) in writing two weeks in advance of the planned change. Any reference in this Loan Agreement to the "Paying Agent" shall include any further Credit Institutions that exercise the role of Paying Agent.  
        
      (6)        By order of the Borrower the Paying Agent acts as custodian for the Lenders (according to their respective partial amount of the Loan) with regard to the original certificate of Indebtedness (  Schuldschein  ). The custodianship of the Paying Agent shall end once the Lender s respective partial amount of the Loan has been repaid (including interest). Above that the Paying Agent acts solely as agent of the Borrower and the Guarantor and does not have any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust to any Lender. 
        
      (7)        Subject to the aforementioned provisions of this   4, fulfilment in relation to the Lender shall only occur once it receives the relevant payments or these are credited to an account it has designated. 
        
        5 Taxes 
        
      (1)        All payments of principal and interest under the Loan Agreement by the Borrower as well as those payable under the Guarantee by the Guarantor shall be made without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes or duties of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat or any governmental authority there ("  Withholding     Taxes  ") unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If the Borrower or the Guarantor is required by law to make such withholding or deduction, then the Borrower or the Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts (the "  Additional Amounts  ") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Lender after such deduction or withholding shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest which would have been receivable under the Loan Agreement in the absence of such deduction or withholding. The foregoing does not apply to the extent any such withholding or deduction is attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a party to this Loan Agreement. 

~ 7 ~ 

(2)        A payment shall not be increased pursuant to this   5 if and to the extent that on the date on which the payment falls due: (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender (which is not a Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank Lender) without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Bank, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Bank other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Loan Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (ii) the Borrower is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under   10. 
        
      (3)        If (i) as a consequence of any amendments of the legal regulations valid in the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat that take effect on the date of this Loan Agreement or thereafter, Withholding Taxes regarding payments of principal or interest under the Loan need to be made (and cannot be avoided despite the Borrower and the Lender having made every reasonable effort to prevent such a situation) and (ii) the Borrower or the Guarantor is obliged to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to   5 para. 1 of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to repay the Loan on giving not less than (30) days  prior notice, either at the aggregate principal amount thereof or at the partial amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender, in each case with interest accrued to the date fixed for prepayment.   Any such notice of prepayment shall not be effected earlier then ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the Borrower or the Guarantor first becomes obliged to make Additional Payments pursuant to   5 para 1.  Any such notice of prepayment in accordance with this   5 para. 2 shall be given in writing and shall be addressed to the Lender (via the Paying Agent). Such notice will be irrevocable and must specify the date fixed for prepayment. The Paying Agent shall immediately inform the Lenders about such notice of prepayment. The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for any loss incurred by the latter as a result of the premature repayment (early repayment penalty). 
        
      For the avoidance of doubt: any prepayments on the income or corporate income tax made by the Lender such as the German flat rate interest tax (Abgeltungssteuer and Zinsertragssteuer) do not constitute withholding taxes within the meaning of the provision above. 
        
        6 Increased Costs 
        
      If - after the date hereof - by reason of introduction or change of the interpretation or application by the respective competent authority with respect to any law or regulation or compliance with any law or regulation (except for such laws and regulations which have been in force as of the date of this Loan Agreement and with which the respective Lender was not in compliance as of the date hereof), there is (a) any substantial increase in the costs for a Lender to fund or maintain the Loan or (b) a reduction in the rate of return on the Loan or a decrease in the net return on the Loan in relation to the equity of the respective Lender, then the affected Lender, the Guarantor and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations with the aim of finding an acceptable solution for the Parties. 
        
        7 Negative Pledge, Status (pari passu), Non-Bank Rules 
        
      (1)   For the term of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantor will not, and will ensure that none of their respective Principal Subsidiaries will, create or permit to subsist any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge or other form of in rem security interest (the "  Security  ") upon any of their respective assets, to secure (i) any Financial Indebtedness or (ii) any guarantee or indemnity in respect of any Financial Indebtedness unless, at the same time or prior thereto, the Borrower's obligations under the Loan Agreement are equally and rateably secured.

      (2)   The Borrower and the Guarantor shall ensure that for the term of this Loan Agreement, their respective payment obligations under this Loan Agreement or the Guarantee will rank pari passu with all their other present and future, unsecured and unsubordinated payment obligations. This shall not apply to payment obligations whose prior servicing results from mandatory, generally applicable laws or regulations or governmental requirements or in the connection with national or local tax laws or regulations. 
        
      (3)   The Borrower shall ensure that it is at all times in compliance with the Swiss Non-Bank Rules, provided that the Borrower shall not be in breach of this undertaking if its number of creditors in respect of either the Swiss Ten Non-Bank-Rule or the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule is exceeded solely by reason of a failure by one or more Lenders to comply with their obligations under   10. For the purpose of its compliance with the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule under this   7(3), the number of Lenders under this Agreement which are not Qualifying Banks shall be deemed to be eight (irrespective of whether or not there are, at any time, any such Lenders). 
        
        8 Events of Default 
        
      (1)   The Lender shall be entitled to terminate the Loan Agreement immediately and to demand immediate redemption of the Loan and all related claims in particular if

      (b)       the Borrower or Guarantor fails to perform any other material obligation under this Loan Agreement and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) calendar days after notice thereof has been given by the Lender to the Borrower or Guarantor (as applicable); or 
        
      (c)   (i) any Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower, the Guarantor or of any of its Principal Subsidiaries, which exceeds an amount of USD 50 Mio., is not paid when due or after the expiry of any relevant grace period as set forth under the terms of the instrument governing that Financial Indebtedness, or

      (d)      the Borrower, the Guarantor or any of its Principal Subsidiaries is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or is over-indebted or admits its inability to pay its debts as they fall due or its over-indebtedness, suspends making payments on its debts or, by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties, commences negotiations with one or more of its creditors with a view to the general readjustment or rescheduling of its indebtedness or makes an assignment for the benefit of or a composition with its creditors; or 
        
      (e)  a competent court opens insolvency proceedings against the Borrower's, Guarantor s or a Principal Subsidiary s assets (or does not commence such proceedings due to the absence of cost-covering assets), such proceedings are instituted but not discharged or stayed within sixty (60) days, or the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Principal Subsidiary applies for or institutes such proceedings; or

      (h)  the Borrower, the Guarantor or any Principal Subsidiary ceases its business operations in whole or in material parts thereof, provided that this does not occur as part of any transaction permitted under   8(1)(i);; or 
        
      (i)  the Borrower or the Guarantor is merged into another entity or all or substantially all of its assets are conveyed or transferred to another entity, unless (i) the entity is a corporation domiciled in the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland or the Federal States of Delaware or Georgia (both in the United States of America) which assumes all obligations of the Borrower under this Loan Agreement either by an agreement or by operation of law, and (ii) the economic and financial situation of such entity is not less sound than that of the Borrower or the Guarantor (as applicable) at the time of the occurrence of such event; or

        9 Guarantee 
        
      (1)   The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees in favour of the Lender subject to German law to pay to the Lender all present and future claims (whether contingent or subject to a time limit) of the Lender under this Loan Agreement against the Borrower. The payment shall be due pay within five (5) Business Days of a written demand by the Lender and assertion that the Borrower has failed to pay an amount payable under the Loan when due.   4 shall apply on the payments under the Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Guarantee does not constitute a guarantee upon first demand (  Garantie auf erstes Anfordern  ) and, in particular, receipt of such written demand shall not preclude any rights and/or defenses the Guarantor may have with respect to any payment requested by the Lender under this guarantee and indemnity. 
        
      (2)   This Guarantee is an independent payment obligation of the Guarantor which shall remain binding irrespective of the legal validity and enforceability of the Loan Agreement and notwithstanding any defenses or remedies (  Einwendungen und Einreden  ) that the Borrower or any third party may raise. 
        
      (3)   The Guarantee shall terminate once all amounts due under the Loan Agreement have been unconditionally and finally paid. 
  Notwithstanding the termination, the Guarantee shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect if the Lender has to repay any amounts received as a payment under  the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee due to insolvency proceedings before court or any similar proceedings regarding the Borrower. 
        
      (4)   Until all amounts which are or may become payable by the Guarantor under this Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, (i) any claims of the Guarantor against the Borrower resulting from any payment made by the Guarantor to the Lender hereunder shall be subordinated to any outstanding claims of the Lender against the Borrower under this Loan Agreement, and (ii) the Guarantor undertakes not to claim any payments from the Borrower arising out of or based upon any right of subrogation. 

~ 11 ~ 

(5)   The Guarantor hereby waives its rights to terminate the Guarantee by depositing the guarantee amount with the competent local court (  Amtsgericht  ) by way of security. 
        
        10 Transfer 
        
      (1)   The Lender may transfer its contractual position hereunder (including those under the Guarantee) in full or in partial amounts of at least EUR 500,000 and in whole multiples of EUR 500,000 above that - to a Third Party by way of assumption of contract.  
        
      (a)    In case of the first transfer of the contractual position by the First Lender the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   A transfer to a Lender which is not a Qualifying Bank is subject to the consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. It is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. 
        
      Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Loan Agreement as if it is not a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (ii)   The transfer will be effected by a confirmation of transaction (  Gesch ftsbest tigung  ) to be issued by the First Lender and countersigned by the joining Lender. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay.  
        
      (b)    For all following transfers of the contractual position the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender which does not meet the definition of a Qualifying Bank is only permitted with the prior written consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; in particular it is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall not be treated as a Qualifying Bank for the purposes of this Loan Agreement. 
        
      (ii)   Such transfer shall become effective as of the transfer date set forth in the Transfer Certificate (Annex 3), provided that the Paying Agent has received a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Certificate substantially in the form set out in the example in Annex 3. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay by submitting a copy of the relevant Transfer Certificate. 
        
      (iii)    In the event that the Paying Agent receives a Transfer Certificate less than five (5) Banking Days before an Interest Payment Date, any payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the resigning Lender shall release the Borrower from its payment obligations to the joining Lender in the amount of such payment. 

~ 12 ~ 

(2)    Each Lender which confirmed that it was a Qualifying Bank undertakes to notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent promptly upon becoming aware of it ceasing to be a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (3)    The result of a transfer is that all of the resigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement and the Guarantee are passed over to the joining Lender to the extent that they are transferred. The effect of a transfer is that the existing Loan Agreement and the Guarantee remain unchanged in force between the new contract parties to the extent that rights and obligations are transferred. 
        
      (4)   By signing this Loan Agreement, the Borrower grants its prior consent to any such transfer made in compliance with   10 (1). 
        
      (5)   The Lender shall be authorized to transfer all its claims under this Loan (incl. those under the Guarantee) to the Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque Centrale du Luxembourg or any other central bank of the ECB system or to the Swiss National Bank or any eurozone development bank ("  F rderbank  ") as security for refinancing purposes. For the validity of such transfer expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. Likewise, in case of such transfers being made by any central bank of the ECB system or eurozone development bank expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. In case of the liquidation of any rights arising out of this Loan Agreement by any central bank of the ECB system, the restrictions under   10(1)shall not apply. 
        
      (6)   For the purposes of this   10, the Borrower and the Guarantor hereby give their consent to the forwarding of all information contained in this Loan Agreement to joining Lenders or potentially joining Lenders (including any relevant data such joining Lender or potentially joining Lender may require for purposes of section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or in order to meet any other "know your customer" requirements (the "  KYC Data  ")), the respective central bank or development bank for such transfer and, if applicable, to third parties acquiring the participation from beneficiaries to whom a transfer in accordance with   10 (5) has been made in case of an enforcement of such a security. Such consent shall also extend to measures of publication (e.g. recording the security in a register that authorised third parties have access to) which are required by law for the constitution or consistency of such a security and they exempt the Lender from the banking confidentiality in this respect. 
        
      (7)   No Lender shall enter into a sub-participation arrangement with another person or assign any rights or claims under this Loan Agreement without transferring the relevant contractual position at the same time and to the same transferee. The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender (i) which does not meet the definition of a Third Party or (ii) is a private individual is not permitted. 
        
        11 Nature of a Lender's Rights and Obligations 
        
      (1)   The obligations of a Lender under this Loan Agreement are not joint and several (keine gesamtschuldnerische Haftung). No Lender is liable for the obligations of any other Lender under the Loan Agreement. 
        
      (2)   The rights of a Lender under this Loan Agreement (and under the Guarantee) are not joint and several (keine Gesamtgl ubiger). The amounts owed at any time under the Loan Agreement from the Borrower to any Lender shall constitute a separate and independent debt and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Loan Agreement and out of the Guarantee independently from another Lender. 
        
        12 Information 
        
      (1)       For the purposes of complying with the requirements under section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG), the Borrower and the Guarantor shall submit in a timely manner to the Lender any  

~ 13 ~ 

documents and information required to comply with the Lender's statutory obligations. During the term of the Loan, the Borrower and the Guarantor shall in particular supply the following documents to the Paying Agent for submission to the Lenders:

      (b)   any other information a Lender may reasonably request in order to comply with legal requirements. 
        
      (2)   The obligation to disclose documents pursuant to   12 para. 1 shall cease to apply if the documents necessary to comply with section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or any other legal requirements are freely accessible on the Borrower's or Guarantor s website (in a form that can be saved or printed). 
        
      (3)   The Borrower and the Guarantor hereby authorize the Lender to pass on or to disclose for review any such documents, data and information as the Lender may consider necessary, useful or appropriate to any potential Third Party (or to a member of the European system of central banks or to the Swiss National Bank for the purposes set out in   10(4)or to such persons, who are involved in the settlement of the transfer for technical or legal reasons (such as legal advisors, rating agencies, auditors) or to governmental courts and authorities (especially supervisory authorities) that require disclosure by mandatory law, and therefore release the Lender from banking confidentiality. 
        
      (4)   Apart from that, the Parties, the Guarantor and the Paying Agent agree to treat information and documents received in connection with this Loan as confidential.  Legal or regulatory disclosure requirements that the Lender or Paying Agent are subject to remain unaffected.

        2 Interest 
        
      (1)   The Loan shall bear interest on its aggregate principal amount at the rate of 1.000 per cent per annum from (and including) the Disbursement Date to (but excluding) the Repayment Date as specified in   3 (1). 
        
      (2)   Interest shall be payable in arrears on 19 October in each year (each an "  Interest Payment Date  "). The first interest payment shall be made on 19 October 2017. 
        
      (3)   If any such Interest Payment Date is not a Banking Day, payment shall be due on the immediately following Banking Day. The Lender shall not be entitled to claim any further interest or any other payments as a result of such deferral. Interest shall be calculated on an act/act basis (ICMA). 

~ 5 ~ 

(4)   If interest payable by the Borrower is subject to Swiss Withholding Tax and should   5(1) be unenforceable for any reason, the applicable interest rate in relation to that interest payment shall be (i) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment (as provided for in this   2 in the absence of this sub-paragraph) divided by (ii) 1 minus the rate at which the relevant tax deduction is required to be made (where the rate at which the relevant tax deduction is required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of 1 rather than as a percentage). 
        
      (5)   To the extent that interest payable by the Borrower under this Loan Agreement becomes subject to Swiss Withholding Tax, each relevant Lender and the Borrower shall promptly cooperate by completing any procedural formalities (including submitting forms and documents required by the appropriate tax authority) to the extent possible and necessary for a Lender to obtain a full or partial refund of Swiss Withholding Tax under applicable double taxation treaties. The Borrower shall provide the Lenders with such documents and information required for applying for a refund of such Swiss Withholding Tax. In the event Swiss Withholding Tax is refunded to a Lender by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, the relevant Lender shall forward, after deduction of costs, such amount to the Borrower, unless an event of default as specified under   8 of this Loan Agreement is continuing. 
        
      (6)   A payment shall not be increased pursuant to this   2 if and to the extent that on the date on which the payment falls due (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender (which is not a Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank Lender) without a tax deduction in respect of Swiss Withholding Tax if the Lender had been a Qualifying Bank, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Bank other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Loan Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (ii) the Borrower is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under   10. 
        
        3 Repayment, early Redemption 
        
      (1)        The Loan shall be repaid at its aggregate principal amount in full on 19 October 2021, provided, however, that if such day is not a Banking Day, payment shall be due on the following Banking Day (the "  Repayment Date  "). The Lender shall not be entitled to claim any further interest or any other payments as a result of such deferral. 
        
      (2)        In the event a Change of Control has occurred, the Borrower shall inform the Lenders through the Paying Agent whether it requests to enter into negotiations with the Lenders. Each Lender shall, upon such request, enter into good faith negotiations with the Borrower with a view to continuing the Loan for a negotiation period of up to thirty (30) days after receipt of that request (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Borrower and each respective Lender) (such period, in each case, the  "  Consultation Period  "). Each Lender shall, after the expiry of the relevant Consultation Period, be entitled to terminate the Loan in writing to the Borrower (copy to the Paying Agent) at its partial amount of the aggregate principal amount thereof with interest accrued to the date fixed for prepayment on giving not less than thirty (30) days  prior notice. Such notice will be irrevocable and must specify the date fixed for prepayment. 
        
        4 Payments, Paying Agent 
        
      (1)        The Borrower and   in case of the utilization of the Guarantee   the Guarantor irrevocably undertake to pay, as and when due, any sum of principal or interest owed under the Loan Agreement in Euros to the account of the Paying Agent by 12:00 (Munich time). 

~ 6 ~ 

(2)        If any sum of principal is not paid to and available on the account of the Paying Agent by 12:00 (Munich time) when due, the Paying Agent shall not be obliged to forward the due amount to the Lender on the same day. The respective sum shall bear interest from (and including) the due date to (but excluding) the date of actual payment of the sum overdue at a rate of 1 per cent per annum above the rate of interest applicable to the Loan on the respective due date without prejudice to the right of the Lender to claim any further damages and without prejudice to the right of the Borrower to present evidence that the loss due to the late payment was less. 
        
      (3)        If an interest payment is not made to the account of the Paying Agent by 12:00 (Munich time) when due, the Paying Agent shall not be obliged to forward the due amount to the Lender on the same day. The Lender has the right to demand indemnification for the loss caused by the delay in payment. 
        
      (4)        Payments by the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be applied in the sequence provided for in section 367 para. 1 of the German Civil Code (BGB) to the amounts falling due. If, in the event of a full or partial transfer of the contractual position pursuant to   10, the payments by the Borrower or the Guarantor are not sufficient to fully redeem any given amount due, the payments of the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be distributed among the Lenders on a pro rata basis in conformity with their relevant participations in the Loan. 
        
      (5)        By a separate agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantor have mandated Bayerische Landesbank to exercise the role of paying agent (Bayerische Landesbank shall hereinafter be referred to as "  Paying Agent  " with respect to the duties in connection with this role). The Paying Agent shall exercise this role in accordance with the paying agency agreement dated as of 12 October 2016. The Borrower together with the Guarantor may at any time mandate another Credit Institution in the Federal Republic of Germany to exercise the role of Paying Agent provided the Borrower informs the Paying Agent (with copy to the Lender) in writing two weeks in advance of the planned change. Any reference in this Loan Agreement to the "Paying Agent" shall include any further Credit Institutions that exercise the role of Paying Agent.  
        
      (6)        By order of the Borrower the Paying Agent acts as custodian for the Lenders (according to their respective partial amount of the Loan) with regard to the original certificate of Indebtedness (  Schuldschein  ). The custodianship of the Paying Agent shall end once the Lender s respective partial amount of the Loan has been repaid (including interest). Above that the Paying Agent acts solely as agent of the Borrower and the Guarantor and does not have any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust to any Lender. 
        
      (7)        Subject to the aforementioned provisions of this   4, fulfilment in relation to the Lender shall only occur once it receives the relevant payments or these are credited to an account it has designated. 
        
        5 Taxes 
        
      (1)        All payments of principal and interest under the Loan Agreement by the Borrower as well as those payable under the Guarantee by the Guarantor shall be made without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes or duties of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat or any governmental authority there ("  Withholding     Taxes  ") unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If the Borrower or the Guarantor is required by law to make such withholding or deduction, then the Borrower or the Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts (the "  Additional Amounts  ") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Lender after such deduction or withholding shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest which would have been receivable under the Loan Agreement in the absence of such deduction or withholding. The foregoing does not apply to the extent any such withholding or deduction is attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a party to this Loan Agreement. 

~ 7 ~ 

(2)        A payment shall not be increased pursuant to this   5 if and to the extent that on the date on which the payment falls due: (i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender (which is not a Permitted Non-Qualifying Bank Lender) without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Bank, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Bank other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Loan Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (ii) the Borrower is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under   10. 
        
      (3)        If (i) as a consequence of any amendments of the legal regulations valid in the country where the Borrower or the Guarantor has its legal seat that take effect on the date of this Loan Agreement or thereafter, Withholding Taxes regarding payments of principal or interest under the Loan need to be made (and cannot be avoided despite the Borrower and the Lender having made every reasonable effort to prevent such a situation) and (ii) the Borrower or the Guarantor is obliged to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to   5 para. 1 of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall be entitled to repay the Loan on giving not less than (30) days  prior notice, either at the aggregate principal amount thereof or at the partial amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender, in each case with interest accrued to the date fixed for prepayment.   Any such notice of prepayment shall not be effected earlier then ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the Borrower or the Guarantor first becomes obliged to make Additional Payments pursuant to   5 para 1.  Any such notice of prepayment in accordance with this   5 para. 2 shall be given in writing and shall be addressed to the Lender (via the Paying Agent). Such notice will be irrevocable and must specify the date fixed for prepayment. The Paying Agent shall immediately inform the Lenders about such notice of prepayment. The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for any loss incurred by the latter as a result of the premature repayment (early repayment penalty). 
        
      For the avoidance of doubt: any prepayments on the income or corporate income tax made by the Lender such as the German flat rate interest tax (Abgeltungssteuer and Zinsertragssteuer) do not constitute withholding taxes within the meaning of the provision above. 
        
        6 Increased Costs 
        
      If - after the date hereof - by reason of introduction or change of the interpretation or application by the respective competent authority with respect to any law or regulation or compliance with any law or regulation (except for such laws and regulations which have been in force as of the date of this Loan Agreement and with which the respective Lender was not in compliance as of the date hereof), there is (a) any substantial increase in the costs for a Lender to fund or maintain the Loan or (b) a reduction in the rate of return on the Loan or a decrease in the net return on the Loan in relation to the equity of the respective Lender, then the affected Lender, the Guarantor and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations with the aim of finding an acceptable solution for the Parties. 
        
        7 Negative Pledge, Status (pari passu), Non-Bank Rules 
        
      (1)   For the term of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantor will not, and will ensure that none of their respective Principal Subsidiaries will, create or permit to subsist any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge or other form of in rem security interest (the "  Security  ") upon any of their respective assets, to secure (i) any Financial Indebtedness or (ii) any guarantee or indemnity in respect of any Financial Indebtedness unless, at the same time or prior thereto, the Borrower's obligations under the Loan Agreement are equally and rateably secured.

      (2)   The Borrower and the Guarantor shall ensure that for the term of this Loan Agreement, their respective payment obligations under this Loan Agreement or the Guarantee will rank pari passu with all their other present and future, unsecured and unsubordinated payment obligations. This shall not apply to payment obligations whose prior servicing results from mandatory, generally applicable laws or regulations or governmental requirements or in the connection with national or local tax laws or regulations. 
        
      (3)   The Borrower shall ensure that it is at all times in compliance with the Swiss Non-Bank Rules, provided that the Borrower shall not be in breach of this undertaking if its number of creditors in respect of either the Swiss Ten Non-Bank-Rule or the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule is exceeded solely by reason of a failure by one or more Lenders to comply with their obligations under   10. For the purpose of its compliance with the Swiss Twenty Non-Bank Rule under this   7(3), the number of Lenders under this Agreement which are not Qualifying Banks shall be deemed to be eight (irrespective of whether or not there are, at any time, any such Lenders). 
        
        8 Events of Default 
        
      (1)   The Lender shall be entitled to terminate the Loan Agreement immediately and to demand immediate redemption of the Loan and all related claims in particular if 
        
      (a)   the Borrower fails to pay interest or principal on the relevant due date unless such non-payment results from technical or other administrative reasons beyond the control of the Borrower and is not remedied within five (5) Banking Days; or  
        
      (b)       the Borrower or Guarantor fails to perform any other material obligation under this Loan Agreement and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) calendar days after notice thereof has been given by the Lender to the Borrower or Guarantor (as applicable); or 
        
      (c)   (i) any Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower, the Guarantor or of any of its Principal Subsidiaries, which exceeds an amount of USD 50 Mio., is not paid when due or after the expiry of any relevant grace period as set forth under the terms of the instrument governing that Financial Indebtedness, or

      (f)   the Borrower or the Guarantor enters formal liquidation proceedings provided that such liquidation does not occur as part of any transaction permitted under   8(1)(i); or 
        
      (g)   any secured party takes possession of all or material parts of the assets or the operations of the Borrower, the Guarantor or of any Principal Subsidiary, or an administrative receiver for those assets or operations is appointed or other enforcement measures have been approved/granted in this regard; or

      (i)   the Borrower or the Guarantor is merged into another entity or all or substantially all of its assets are conveyed or transferred to another entity, unless (i) the entity is a corporation domiciled in the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland or the Federal States of Delaware or Georgia (both in the United States of America) which assumes all obligations of the Borrower under this Loan Agreement either by an agreement or by operation of law, and (ii) the economic and financial situation of such entity is not less sound than that of the Borrower or the Guarantor (as applicable) at the time of the occurrence of such event; or

        9 Guarantee 
        
      (1)   The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees in favour of the Lender subject to German law to pay to the Lender all present and future claims (whether contingent or subject to a time limit) of the Lender under this Loan Agreement against the Borrower. The payment shall be due pay within five (5) Business Days of a written demand by the Lender and assertion that the Borrower has failed to pay an amount payable under the Loan when due.   4 shall apply on the payments under the Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Guarantee does not constitute a guarantee upon first demand (  Garantie auf erstes Anfordern  ) and, in particular, receipt of such written demand shall not preclude any rights and/or defenses the Guarantor may have with respect to any payment requested by the Lender under this guarantee and indemnity. 
        
      (2)   This Guarantee is an independent payment obligation of the Guarantor which shall remain binding irrespective of the legal validity and enforceability of the Loan Agreement and notwithstanding any defenses or remedies (  Einwendungen und Einreden  ) that the Borrower or any third party may raise. 
        
      (3)   The Guarantee shall terminate once all amounts due under the Loan Agreement have been unconditionally and finally paid. 
  Notwithstanding the termination, the Guarantee shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect if the Lender has to repay any amounts received as a payment under  the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee due to insolvency proceedings before court or any similar proceedings regarding the Borrower. 
        
      (4)   Until all amounts which are or may become payable by the Guarantor under this Loan Agreement have been irrevocably paid in full, (i) any claims of the Guarantor against the Borrower resulting from any payment made by the Guarantor to the Lender hereunder shall be subordinated to any outstanding claims of the Lender against the Borrower under this Loan Agreement, and (ii) the Guarantor undertakes not to claim any payments from the Borrower arising out of or based upon any right of subrogation. 

~ 11 ~ 

(5)   The Guarantor hereby waives its rights to terminate the Guarantee by depositing the guarantee amount with the competent local court (  Amtsgericht  ) by way of security. 
        
        10 Transfer 
        
      (1)   The Lender may transfer its contractual position hereunder (including those under the Guarantee) in full or in partial amounts of at least EUR 500,000 and in whole multiples of EUR 500,000 above that - to a Third Party by way of assumption of contract.  
        
      (a)    In case of the first transfer of the contractual position by the First Lender the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   A transfer to a Lender which is not a Qualifying Bank is subject to the consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. It is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. 
        
      Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Loan Agreement as if it is not a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (ii)   The transfer will be effected by a confirmation of transaction (  Gesch ftsbest tigung  ) to be issued by the First Lender and countersigned by the joining Lender. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay.  
        
      (b)    For all following transfers of the contractual position the following shall apply: 
        
      (i)   The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender which does not meet the definition of a Qualifying Bank is only permitted with the prior written consent of the Borrower. The consent of the Borrower to such transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; in particular it is not unreasonable for the Borrower to withhold its consent if, following such transfer, the number of Lenders that are not Qualifying Banks would exceed eight. Each Lender will confirm to the Borrower before the date on which it intends to become a party to this Loan Agreement in its capacity as such whether it is a Qualifying Bank, and if it is not a Qualifying Bank, that it only counts as one (1) non-bank lender for purposes of determining the number of non-bank lenders. If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this provision then such Lender shall not be treated as a Qualifying Bank for the purposes of this Loan Agreement. 
        
      (ii)   Such transfer shall become effective as of the transfer date set forth in the Transfer Certificate (Annex 3), provided that the Paying Agent has received a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Certificate substantially in the form set out in the example in Annex 3. The Paying Agent shall inform the Borrower with respect to each transfer without undue delay by submitting a copy of the relevant Transfer Certificate. 
        
      (iii)    In the event that the Paying Agent receives a Transfer Certificate less than five (5) Banking Days before an Interest Payment Date, any payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the resigning Lender shall release the Borrower from its payment obligations to the joining Lender in the amount of such payment. 

~ 12 ~ 

(2)    Each Lender which confirmed that it was a Qualifying Bank undertakes to notify the Borrower and the Paying Agent promptly upon becoming aware of it ceasing to be a Qualifying Bank. 
        
      (3)    The result of a transfer is that all of the resigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement and the Guarantee are passed over to the joining Lender to the extent that they are transferred. The effect of a transfer is that the existing Loan Agreement and the Guarantee remain unchanged in force between the new contract parties to the extent that rights and obligations are transferred. 
        
      (4)   By signing this Loan Agreement, the Borrower grants its prior consent to any such transfer made in compliance with   10 (1). 
        
      (5)   The Lender shall be authorized to transfer all its claims under this Loan (incl. those under the Guarantee) to the Deutsche Bundesbank, Banque Centrale du Luxembourg or any other central bank of the ECB system or to the Swiss National Bank or any eurozone development bank ("  F rderbank  ") as security for refinancing purposes. For the validity of such transfer expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. Likewise, in case of such transfers being made by any central bank of the ECB system or eurozone development bank expressly no formal requirements and obligations to inform the Borrower shall be required. In case of the liquidation of any rights arising out of this Loan Agreement by any central bank of the ECB system, the restrictions under   10(1)shall not apply. 
        
      (6)   For the purposes of this   10, the Borrower and the Guarantor hereby give their consent to the forwarding of all information contained in this Loan Agreement to joining Lenders or potentially joining Lenders (including any relevant data such joining Lender or potentially joining Lender may require for purposes of section 18 of the German Banking Act (KWG) or in order to meet any other "know your customer" requirements (the "  KYC Data  ")), the respective central bank or development bank for such transfer and, if applicable, to third parties acquiring the participation from beneficiaries to whom a transfer in accordance with   10 (5) has been made in case of an enforcement of such a security. Such consent shall also extend to measures of publication (e.g. recording the security in a register that authorised third parties have access to) which are required by law for the constitution or consistency of such a security and they exempt the Lender from the banking confidentiality in this respect. 
        
      (7)   No Lender shall enter into a sub-participation arrangement with another person or assign any rights or claims under this Loan Agreement without transferring the relevant contractual position at the same time and to the same transferee. The transfer of the contractual position to a Lender (i) which does not meet the definition of a Third Party or (ii) is a private individual is not permitted. 
        
        11 Nature of a Lender's Rights and Obligations
