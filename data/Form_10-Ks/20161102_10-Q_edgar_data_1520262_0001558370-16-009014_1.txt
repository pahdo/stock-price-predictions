1. THE COMPANY   

Alkermes plc is a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical company that applies its scientific expertise and proprietary technologies to research, develop and commercialize, both with partners and on its own, pharmaceutical products that are designed to address unmet medical needs of patients in major therapeutic areas. Alkermes has a diversified portfolio of marketed drug products and a clinical pipeline of products that address CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis. Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Alkermes has a research and development ( R D ) center in Waltham, Massachusetts; an R D and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland; and a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and have been prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data, which is presented for comparative purposes, was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (commonly referred to as  GAAP ). In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary to state fairly the results of operations for the reported periods. 

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Alkermes, which are contained in the Company s Annual Report that has been filed with the SEC. The results of the Company s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of the Company s operations for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alkermes plc and its wholly owned subsidiaries as disclosed in Note 2,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,   within the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  accompanying its Annual Report. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments and methodologies, including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances, its collaborative relationships, clinical trial expenses, the valuation of inventory, impairment and amortization of intangibles and long-lived assets, share-based compensation, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, valuation of contingent consideration, valuation of investments and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Segment Information 

The Company operates as one business segment, which is the business of developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines. The Company s chief decision maker, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Company s operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the Company s operations as a single operating unit.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) (Continued) 

Income Taxes 

The Company s income tax (benefit) provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relates primarily to U.S. federal and state taxes on income. The Company records a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of its assets and liabilities, as measured by enacted jurisdictional tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse. At September 30, 2016, the Company maintained a valuation allowance against certain of its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates, at each reporting period, the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard-setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The guidance is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2018, and the Company could early adopt the standard for its year ending December 31, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. Existing GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on how to account for these share-based payments. The new guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Entities have the option of prospectively applying the guidance to awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively applying the guidance to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and this guidance does not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016, and this guidance does not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that enhances the reporting model for financial instruments through addressing certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this update include: requiring equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through the income statement; simplifying the impairment assessment of equity instruments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requiring an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments;

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) (Continued) 

requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; and clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2018, and the Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous GAAP and this guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2019, and the Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance as part of its simplification initiative to eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2017, and the Company does not currently expect this guidance to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance as part of its simplification initiative that involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The amendments in this update established that: all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement; excess tax benefits be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows; the entity make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, which is current GAAP, or account for forfeitures as they occur; the threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions; and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2017, and the Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2018, and the Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

3. DIVESTITURE 

On March 7, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Gainesville, GA facility,   the related manufacturing and royalty revenue associated with certain products manufactured at the facility, and the   rights to IV/IM and other parenteral forms of Meloxicam and certain intellectual property related to IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam (the  Gainesville Transaction ) to Recro Pharma, Inc. ( Recro ) and Recro Pharma LLC (together with Recro, the  Purchasers ). The sale was completed on April 10, 2015 and, under the terms of the agreement, Recro paid the Company $54.0 million in cash and issued to the Company warrants to purchase an aggregate of 350,000 shares of Recro common stock at a per share exercise price of $19.46, which was two times the closing price of Recro s common stock on the day prior to closing. The Company is also eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on net sales of IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam   any other product with the same active ingredient as Meloxicam IV/IM that is discovered or identified using certain of the Company s intellectual property to which Recro was provided a right of use, through license or transfer, pursuant to the Gainesville Transaction (together, the  Meloxicam Products )   and up to $120.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the Meloxicam Products.

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) (Continued) 

The gain on the Gainesville Transaction was determined as follows: 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   the Gainesville, GA facility and associated intellectual property ( IP ) generated income before income taxes of none and $  4.5   million, respectively. The Company recorded the initial gain on the Gainesville Transaction in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and made adjustments in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 to record additional transaction costs. The Company determined that the sale of assets in connection with the Gainesville Transaction did not constitute a strategic shift and that it did not and will not have a major effect on its operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operations from the Gainesville Transaction are not reported in discontinued operations.  

The Company determined the value of the Gainesville Transaction s contingent consideration using the following valuation approaches:  

The fair value of the two regulatory milestones was estimated based on applying the likelihood of achieving the regulatory milestone and applying a discount rate from the expected time the milestone occurs to the balance sheet date. The Company expects the regulatory milestone events to occur within the next one and two years, respectively, and used a discount rate of 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively, for each of these events. 

To estimate the fair value of future royalties on net sales of   the Meloxicam Products  , the Company assessed the likelihood of   the Meloxicam Products   being approved for sale and estimated the expected future sales given approval and IP protection. The Company then discounted these expected payments using a discount rate of 17.0%, which the Company believes captures a market participant s view of the risk associated with the expected payments.  

The sales milestones were determined through the use of a real options approach, where net sales are simulated in a risk-neutral world. To employ this methodology, the Company used a risk-adjusted expected growth rate based on its assessments of expected growth in net sales of the approved   Meloxicam Products  , adjusted by an appropriate factor capturing their respective correlation with the market. A resulting expected (probability-weighted) milestone payment was then discounted at a cost of debt plus an alpha, which ranged from 10.8% to 12.2%.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined that the value of the Gainesville Transaction s contingent consideration increased due primarily to a shorter time to payment on the milestones and royalties included in the contingent consideration, although the value did decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to a change in the planned timing of the New Drug Application ( NDA ) submission for Meloxicam.  These changes were recorded as  Change in the fair value of contingent consideration  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

The warrants the Company received to purchase 350,000 shares of Recro common stock have a fair value of $1.5 million at September 30, 2016 and are being recorded within  Other assets  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company used a Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions to determine the fair value of these warrants at September 30, 2016:

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) (Continued) 

An increase in the fair value of the warrants of $0.2 million and a decrease in the fair value of the warrants of $0.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, was recorded within  Other (expense) income, net  in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the warrants decreased by $0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased by $0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

At September 30, 2016, the Company believed that the unrealized losses on its available-for-sale investments were temporary. The investments with unrealized losses consisted primarily of corporate debt securities. In making the determination that the decline in fair value of these securities was temporary, the Company considered various factors, including, but not limited to: the length of time each security was in an unrealized loss position; the extent to which fair value was less than cost; financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuers; and the Company s intent not to sell these securities and the assessment that it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

In February 2016, the Company entered into a collaboration and license option agreement with Reset Therapeutics, Inc. ( Reset ). The Company made an upfront, non-refundable payment of $10.0 million in partial consideration of the grant to the Company of the rights and licenses included in such agreement, which was included in R D expense in the three months ended March 31, 2016, and simultaneously made a $15.0 million investment in exchange for shares of Reset s Series B Preferred Stock. The Company is accounting for its investment in Reset under the equity method based on its percentage of ownership, its seat on the board of directors and its belief that it can exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Reset. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a reduction in its investment in Reset of $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, which represents the company s proportional share of Reset s net loss for the period. The Company s $14.0 million investment at September 30, 2016 is included within  Other assets  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

In May 2014, the Company entered into an agreement whereby it is committed to provide up to  7.4 million to a partnership, Fountain Healthcare Partners II, L.P. of Ireland ( Fountain ), which was created to carry on the business of investing exclusively in companies and businesses engaged in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors. The Company s commitment represents approximately 7% of the partnership s total funding, and the Company is accounting for its investment in Fountain under the equity method.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had made payments of, and its investment is equal to, $2.3 million ( 1.8 million), which is included within  Other assets  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a reduction in its investment in Fountain of $0.3 million and $0.4 million  , respectively,   which represents the Company s proportional share of Fountain s net loss for the period.

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair value: 

The Company transfers its financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, between the fair value hierarchies at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers of any securities between the fair value hierarchies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company s investments in U.S. government and agency debt securities, international government agency debt securities and corporate debt securities classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing market-observable data. The market-observable data included reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validated the prices developed using the market-observable data by obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming that the relevant markets are active. 

The following table is a rollforward of the fair value of the Company s assets whose fair values were determined using Level 3 inputs at September 30, 2016: 

The carrying amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated fair value due to their short-term nature. The fair value of the remaining financial instruments not currently recognized at fair value on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets consisted of the $300.0 million, seven-year term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% ( Term Loan B-1 ) and the $75.0 million, four-year term loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with no LIBOR floor ( Term Loan B-2  and together with Term Loan B-1, the  Term Loan Facility ). In September 2016, Term Loan B-2 matured and the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance in its

entirety. The estimated fair value of Term-Loan B-1, which was based on quoted market price indications (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) and which may not be representative of the actual value that could have been or will be realized in the future, was as follows at September 30, 2016:  

6. INVENTORY 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory consisted of the following: 

7. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

Property, plant and equipment consisted of the following: 

8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

Goodwill and intangible assets consisted of the following: 

Based on the Company s most recent analysis, amortization of intangible assets included within its condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 is expected to be approximately $60.0 million, $60.0 million, $60.0

million, $55.0 million and $50.0 million in the years ending December 31, 2016 through 2020, respectively. Although the Company believes such available information and assumptions are reasonable, given the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying its expectations regarding such future revenues, there is the potential for the Company s actual results to vary significantly from such expectations. If revenues are projected to change, the related amortization of the intangible assets will change in proportion to the change in revenues. 

On January 21, 2016, following the Company s press release regarding its ALKS 5461 development program, the Company s stock price declined by 44% from the previous day s closing price, which the Company considered to be an impairment triggering event. To determine if its goodwill was impaired, the Company assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. Based on the weight of all available evidence, the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting unit more-likely-than-not exceeded its carrying value.  

9. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following:    

10. LONG-TERM DEBT 

Long-term debt consisted of the following:  

In September 2016, Term Loan B-2 matured and the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance of $60.9 million in its entirety.  

In October 2016, the Company amended Term Loan B-1, pursuant to which, among other things, the due date of Term Loan B-1 was extended from September 25, 2019 to September 25, 2021 (the  Refinancing ). The Refinancing involved multiple lenders who were considered members of a loan syndicate. In determining whether the Refinancing is to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment or a debt modification, the Company will consider whether creditors remained the same or changed and whether the changes in debt terms are substantial. A change in the debt terms is considered to be substantial if the present value of the remaining cash flows under the new terms of Term Loan B-1 are at least 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original terms of Term Loan B-1 (commonly referred to as the  10% Test ). The Company will perform a separate 10% Test for each individual creditor participating in the loan syndication. The loans of any creditors no longer participating in the loan syndication will be accounted for as a debt extinguishment.

11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

Share-based compensation expense consisted of the following: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of share-based compensation cost was capitalized and recorded as  Inventory  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

12. LOSS PER SHARE 

Basic loss per ordinary share is calculated based upon net loss available to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as the Company was in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share does not assume conversion or exercise of stock options and awards as they would have an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share.  

The following potential ordinary equivalent shares have not been included in the net loss per ordinary share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive: 

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.   On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company would accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on the Company s best estimates based on available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, the Company may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in material adverse adjustments to the Company s operating results. At September 30, 2016, there are no potential losses from claims, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceedings the Company feels are probable of occurring. 

ARISTADA 

On July 13, 2015, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development   Commercialization, Inc. ( Otsuka PD C ) filed a Citizen Petition with the   U.S. Food and Drug Administration (   FDA ) which requested that the FDA refuse to approve the NDA for ARISTADA or delay approval of such NDA until the exclusivity rights covering long-acting aripiprazole expire in December 2017. The FDA approved ARISTADA on October 5, 2015 and, concurrent with such approval, denied Otsuka PD C s Citizen Petition.

On October 15, 2015, Otsuka Pharm. Co., Otsuka PD C, and Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. (collectively,  Otsuka ) filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the  DC Court ) against Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Dr. Stephen Ostroff, Acting Commissioner, FDA; and the FDA, requesting that the DC Court (a) expedite the legal proceedings; (b) declare that the FDA s denial of Otsuka s claimed exclusivity rights and approval of the ARISTADA NDA were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law; (c) vacate FDA s approval of the ARISTADA NDA and vacate any FDA decisions or actions underlying or supporting or predicated upon that approval; (d) declare that Otsuka s claimed exclusivity rights preclude FDA from granting approval of the Alkermes NDA until the expiration of such exclusivity rights in December 2017; and (e) grant any and all other, further, and additional relief, including all necessary and appropriate protective preliminary, interim, or permanent relief, as the nature of the cause may require, including all necessary and appropriate declarations of rights and injunctive relief. The Company successfully intervened in, and received the DC Court s approval to become a party to, this action.  

On July 28, 2016, the DC Court issued an unambiguous opinion in favor of Alkermes and the FDA, affirming in all respects FDA s decision to approve ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and denying the action filed by Otsuka for declaratory and injunctive relief.    Otsuka has filed an appeal of the DC Court s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( DC Circuit ) asking the DC Circuit to reverse the DC Court s decision, vacate FDA s approval of the ARISTADA NDA and remand the case to the DC Court for consideration of any appropriate equitable remedy for Otsuka s lost exclusivity  .  The DC Circuit has scheduled this appellate hearing for December 12, 2016. The Company believes Otsuka s action is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend ARISTADA against such action.   For information about risks relating to this action, see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the section entitled  Citizen Petitions and other actions filed with, or litigation against, the FDA or other regulatory agencies or litigation against Alkermes may negatively impact the approval of our products and our business.  

AMPYRA 

AMPYRA ANDA Litigation 

Ten separate Paragraph IV Certification Notices have been submitted to us and/or the Company s licensee Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. ( Acorda ) from Accord Healthcare, Inc. ( Accord ); Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. ( Actavis ); Alkem Laboratories Ltd. ( Alkem ); Apotex, Inc.; Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. ( Aurobindo ); Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Mylan ); Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. ( Par ); Roxane Laboratories, Inc.; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Inc. (collectively,  Sun ); and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., advising that each of these companies had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) to the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of the Orange Book-listed patents for AMPYRA, and they have also asserted that their generic versions do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In response, the Company and/or Acorda filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the  Delaware Court ) asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,540,938 (which the Company owns), 8,663,685; 8,440,703; 8,354,437 and 8,007,826 (which are owned by Acorda). Requested judicial remedies include recovery of litigation costs and injunctive relief. Lawsuits with eight of the ANDA filers have been consolidated into a single case. The Delaware Court held a bench trial that concluded on September 23, 2016. Mylan is challenging the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court with respect to the Delaware action. Due to Mylan s motion to dismiss, the Company, together with Acorda, also filed another patent infringement suit against Mylan in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia asserting the same U.S. patents and requesting the same judicial relief as in the Delaware action. In March 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the  Federal Circuit ) upheld the Delaware Court s ruling that the litigation against Mylan can continue in the Delaware Court. In June 2016, the Federal Circuit denied Mylan s request for a rehearing to reconsider its previous ruling. Mylan has appealed the Federal Circuit s decision to the Supreme Court of the U.S. All lawsuits were filed within 45 days from the date of receipt of each of the Paragraph IV Certification Notices. As a result, a 30-month statutory stay of approval period applies to each of the ANDAs under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the  Hatch-Waxman Act ). The 30-month stay starts from January 22, 2015, which is the end of the new

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) (Continued) 

chemical entity exclusivity period for AMPYRA. This stay restricts the FDA from approving the ANDAs until July 2017 at the earliest, unless a Federal district court issues a decision adverse to all of the asserted Orange Book-listed patents prior to that date. Such FDA approval would permit the ANDA filers to market generic versions of AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg.  

The Company and/or Acorda has entered into a settlement agreement with each of Accord, Actavis, Alkem, Aurobindo, Par and Sun (collectively, the  Settling ANDA Filers ) to resolve the patent litigation that the Company and/or Acorda brought against the Settling ANDA Filers in the Delaware Court as described above. As a result of the settlement agreements, the Settling ANDA Filers will be permitted to market a generic version of AMPYRA in the U.S. at a specified date in 2027, or potentially earlier under certain circumstances. The parties have submitted their respective settlement agreements to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as required by federal law. The settlements with the Settling ANDA Filers do not resolve pending patent litigation that the Company and Acorda brought against the other ANDA filers, as described above.  

The Company intends to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights. For information about risks relating to the AMPYRA Paragraph IV litigations and other proceedings see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the section entitled  We face claims against our intellectual property rights and competition from generic drug manufacturers.  

AMPYRA IPR Proceedings 

A hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) has filed inter partes review ( IPR ) petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the  USPTO ), challenging U.S. Patent Nos.   8,663,685; 8,440,703; 8,354,437 and 8,007,826   (which are owned by Acorda). In March 2016, the USPTO s Patent Trials and Appeal Board instituted the IPR. A ruling on the IPR petitions is expected within one year of the IPR s institution. The challenged patents are four of the five AMPYRA Orange-Book listed patents. The 30-month statutory stay period based on patent infringement suits filed by us and Acorda against ANDA filers is not impacted by these filings, and remains in effect. 

BYDUREON, RISPERDAL CONSTA AND VIVITROL IPR Proceedings 

On June 3, 2016, the USPTO accepted two separate IPR petitions filed by Luye Pharma Group Ltd., Luye Pharma (USA) Ltd., Shandong Luye Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Nanjing Luye Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (collectively,  Luye ) challenging U.S. Patent Number 6,667,061 (the   061 Patent ), which is an Orange Book-listed patent for each of BYDUREON, RISPERDAL CONSTA and VIVITROL. On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a response to Luye s IPR petitions with the USPTO, following which the USPTO has a further three-month period to decide whether or not to institute a review of the challenged claims of the  061 Patent. If such review is instituted, a decision on the matter would be expected, pursuant to the statutory time frame, within one year of the USPTO s decision to institute such review.  

The Company opposed Luye s requests to institute the IPRs against the  061 Patent. If the USPTO institutes such challenge, the Company will vigorously defend the  061 Patent. For information about risks relating to the  061 Patent IPR proceedings see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the sections entitled  Patent protection for our products is important and uncertain  and  Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable .

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 5 of this Form 10-Q, and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report, which has been filed with the SEC. 

Executive Summary 

Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $62.7 million, or $  0.41   per ordinary share  basic and diluted, as compared to a net loss of $81.0 million, or $0.54 per ordinary share  basic and diluted for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $187.3 million, or $  1.24   per ordinary share  basic and diluted, as compared to a net loss of $157.8 million, or $1.06 per ordinary share  basic and diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included in the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4.5 million of net income related to our Gainesville, GA manufacturing facility, which we sold as part of the Gainesville Transaction in April 2015. 

The decrease in the net loss incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a 47% increase in net sales of VIVITROL and the addition of sales related to ARISTADA, which was first commercialized beginning in October 2015. The increase in net loss incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to increases in R D expense, reflecting an increased investment in our CNS development pipeline, and selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense, reflecting the commercialization of ARISTADA beginning in October 2015. The increase in R D and SG A expenses was partially offset by an increase in net sales of VIVITROL and ARISTADA. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this increase in expenses was partially offset by a decrease in cost of goods manufactured and sold primarily due to the Gainesville Transaction.   These items are discussed in greater detail later in the    Results of Operations    section of this Form 10-Q.

Proprietary Products 

We develop and commercialize products designed to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from addiction and schizophrenia. 

ARISTADA  

ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA is the first of our products to utilize our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is the first atypical antipsychotic with once-monthly and six-week dosing options for delivering and maintaining therapeutic levels of medication in the body through an intramuscular injection. ARISTADA has three dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg and 882 mg) and is packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled product format. We developed, manufacture and commercialize ARISTADA in the U.S. 

On September 27, 2016, U.S. Patent No. 9,452,131 relating to ARISTADA was granted. This patent was added to the patents listed in the Orange Book for ARISTADA, has claims that cover methods of treatment for schizophrenia, and expires in 2035. 

VIVITROL 

VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is the only once monthly, non-addictive, injectable medication approved in the U.S., Russia and certain countries of the CIS for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer based microsphere injectable extended release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one injection every four weeks. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL. We commercialize VIVITROL in the U.S., and Cilag commercializes VIVITROL in Russia and certain countries of the CIS. 

Products Using Our Proprietary Technologies 

We have granted licenses under our proprietary technologies to enable third parties to develop, commercialize and, in some cases, manufacture products for which we receive royalties and/or manufacturing revenues. Such arrangements include the following: 

INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and RISPERDAL CONSTA 

INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate) and RISPERDAL CONSTA (risperidone long acting injection) are long-acting atypical antipsychotics owned and commercialized worldwide by Janssen that incorporate our proprietary technologies. 

INVEGA SUSTENNA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder as either a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension is approved in the European Union ("EU") and other countries outside of the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia and is marketed and sold under the trade name XEPLION. INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION uses our nanoparticle injectable extended-release technology to increase the rate of dissolution and enable the formulation of an aqueous suspension for once-monthly intramuscular administration. INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION is manufactured by Janssen.

Table of Contents  

INVEGA TRINZA is an atypical antipsychotic injection for the treatment of schizophrenia used in people who have been treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months. INVEGA TRINZA, the first schizophrenia treatment to be taken once every three months, became commercially available in the U.S. in June 2015. In May 2016, TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate a 3-monthly injection), was approved in the EU for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients who are clinically stable on XEPLION. INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA uses our proprietary technology and is manufactured by Janssen. 

RISPERDAL CONSTA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia and as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. RISPERDAL CONSTA is approved in numerous countries outside of the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. RISPERDAL CONSTA uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through just one injection every two weeks. RISPERDAL CONSTA microspheres are exclusively manufactured by us. 

AMPYRA/FAMPYRA 

AMPYRA (dalfampridine)/FAMPYRA (fampridine), to our knowledge, is the first treatment approved in the U.S. and in over 50 countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas to improve walking in adults with MS who have walking disability, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Extended-release dalfampridine tablets are marketed and sold by Acorda in the U.S. under the trade name AMPYRA and by Biogen outside the U.S. under the trade name FAMPYRA. In July 2011, the European Medicines Agency conditionally approved FAMPYRA in the EU for the improvement of walking in adults with MS. This authorization was renewed as of August 2015. AMPYRA and FAMPYRA incorporate our oral controlled-release technology. AMPYRA and FAMPYRA are manufactured by us. 

BYDUREON 

BYDUREON (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension) is approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AstraZeneca is responsible for the development and commercialization of BYDUREON worldwide. BYDUREON, a once-weekly formulation of exenatide, uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology. BYDUREON is manufactured by AstraZeneca. 

BYDUREON Pen 2 mg, a pre filled, single use pen injector that contains the same formulation and dose as the original BYDUREON single dose tray, is available in the U.S., certain countries in the EU and Japan.  

Key Development Programs 

Our research and development is focused on leveraging our formulation expertise and proprietary product platforms to develop novel, competitively advantaged medications designed to enhance patient outcomes in major CNS disorders, such as schizophrenia, addiction, depression and MS. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products. The discussion below highlights our key current research and development programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change.

Aripiprazole Lauroxil Two-Month Dose 

Aripiprazole lauroxil is an injectable atypical antipsychotic, currently commercially available as ARISTADA with once-monthly and six-week dosing options for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole lauroxil is also in development with a two-month dosing interval. In February 2016, we announced positive topline results from a randomized, open-label, pharmacokinetic study evaluating a two-month dosing interval of aripiprazole lauroxil extended-release injectable suspension for the treatment of schizophrenia. Based on these phase 1 results, we submitted a supplemental NDA ( sNDA ) to the FDA in August 2016 and the sNDA was accepted by the FDA in October 2016. 

ALKS 5461  

ALKS 5461 is a once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. ALKS 5461 is composed of samidorphan in combination with buprenorphine. Samidorphan, formerly referred to as ALKS 33, is a proprietary oral opioid modulator characterized by limited hepatic metabolism and durable pharmacologic activity in modulating brain opioid receptors. In October 2013, the FDA granted Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.  

In October 2016, we announced positive topline results from FORWARD-5, a phase 3   randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design study   of ALKS 5461 in MDD from the FORWARD (Focused on Results With a Rethinking of Depression) pivotal program. ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by the 6-item Montgomery  sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS-6 ). ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the 10-item Montgomery  sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS-10 ) scores compared to placebo. The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS 5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events for ALKS 5461 in the FORWARD-5 study were nausea, dizziness and fatigue.   FORWARD-5 was conducted in two sequential stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks in duration, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. The results of Stages 1 and 2 were then averaged. Depression scores were assessed using MADRS-6 and MADRS-10. MADRS-6, a subscale of the MADRS-10 assessment tool for depression, focuses on the core symptoms of depression. 

In January 2016, we announced the topline results of FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4. Neither study met the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint, which compared ALKS 5461 to placebo on the change from baseline in MADRS-10 total scores. FORWARD-4 tested two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 0.5mg/0.5mg) compared to placebo. There was a clear trend toward efficacy with the 2mg/2mg dose of ALKS 5461 on the primary endpoint, and post hoc analyses achieved statistical significance for the entire 2mg/2mg dose group on the MADRS-10 endpoint. Based on these analyses, we believe that FORWARD-4 provides supportive evidence of the efficacy of ALKS 5461 in the treatment of MDD. The most commonly reported adverse events in FORWARD-4 were nausea, headache and dizziness. FORWARD-3 tested ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg) compared to placebo. Placebo response was greater than that observed in FORWARD-4 and no treatment effect of ALKS 5461 was observed.  

Based on the results of FORWARD-5, along with the substantial data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of ALKS 5461 for the treatment of MDD from the previously completed successful, randomized, placebo-controlled phase

2 study, together with supportive evidence from FORWARD-4, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA s Division of Psychiatric Products to discuss the filing strategy for ALKS 5461. 

ALKS 3831 

ALKS 3831 is a novel, proprietary, oral investigational medicine designed as a broad-spectrum antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. ALKS 3831 is composed of samidorphan in combination with the established antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which is generally available under the name ZYPREXA. ALKS 3831 is designed to provide the strong efficacy of olanzapine and a differentiated safety profile with favorable weight and metabolic properties and to have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia in patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorder. 

In December 2015 and February 2016, we announced the initiation of ENLIGHTEN-1 and ENLIGHTEN-2, respectively, the two phase 3 studies from the ENLIGHTEN pivotal program for ALKS 3831. The ENLIGHTEN pivotal program will also include supportive studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, metabolic and long-term safety profile of ALKS 3831. We expect to use safety and efficacy data from the ENLIGHTEN pivotal program to serve as the basis for an NDA to be submitted to the FDA, pending study results. 

In October 2016, we announced the initiation of a   phase 1 metabolic study of ALKS 3831 to   assess the effects of ALKS 3831 on whole body insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism and other important metabolic parameters compared to olanzapine. Subjects will be randomized to receive ALKS 3831, olanzapine or placebo for 21 days. Results from the study are expected in the first half of 2017. 

ALKS 8700 

ALKS 8700 is a novel, proprietary, oral investigational monomethyl fumarate ("MMF") molecule in development for the treatment of MS. ALKS 8700 is designed to rapidly and efficiently convert to MMF in the body and to offer differentiated features as compared to the currently marketed dimethyl fumarate, TECFIDERA.  

We plan to file a 505(b)(2) NDA using pharmacokinetic bridging data from studies comparing ALKS 8700 and TECFIDERA and a two-year, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety of ALKS 8700, which we initiated in December 2015. Additionally, we plan to initiate a randomized, head-to-head phase 3 study of the gastrointestinal tolerability of ALKS 8700 compared to TECFIDERA next year. We will need to conduct additional preclinical studies and pharmacokinetic studies to further support pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparability to TECFIDERA. We expect to complete ALKS 8700 registration studies and file the NDA in 2018. 

ALKS 6428 

ALKS 6428 is designed to help physicians transition patients from physical dependence on opioids to VIVITROL for the treatment of opioid dependence. This transition process includes the administration of doses of oral naltrexone in conjunction with buprenorphine during a seven-day treatment period. In September 2015, we initiated a phase 3 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ALKS 6428 in patients with opioid dependence. Enrollment for this study was completed in October 2016 and   results from this study are expected in the first half of 2017. 

ALKS 4230 

ALKS 4230, formerly referred to as RDB 1450, is our selective effector cell activator ( SECA ) that is designed to harness a patient s immune system to preferentially activate and increase the number of tumor killing immune cells. SECA proteins selectively target immune cells to avoid expansion of immune regulatory cells which interfere with the anti-tumor response. SECA molecules are engineered using our proprietary fusion protein technology platform to modulate the natural mechanism of action of a biologic product. We filed an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016 and initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in May 2016. This phase 1 study will be conducted in two stages: a dose-escalation stage followed by a dose-expansion stage. The first stage of the study is designed to determine a maximum tolerated dose, and to identify the optimal dose range of ALKS 4230 based on measures of immunological-pharmacodynamic effects. Following the identification of the optimal dose range of ALKS

4230 in the first stage of the study, the dose-expansion stage of the study will evaluate ALKS 4230 in patients with selected solid tumor types. Initial results from the first stage of the phase 1 study are expected in 2017. 

ALKS 7119 

ALKS 7119 is a novel, proprietary, oral investigational medicine that has a multivalent mechanism of action that acts on key receptors in the brain involved in several CNS diseases, including agitation in Alzheimer s disease, MDD and others. In January 2016, we announced the initiation of a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of ALKS 7119 in healthy subjects. In April 2016, we announced that early results of the single-ascending-dose study demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile and pharmacokinetic properties consistent with potential once-daily dosing.  

Based on these early results, we initiated the multiple-ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers in July 2016. In October 2016, due to tolerability issues observed in a small number of subjects in the study, we ceased further development of ALKS 7119. The effects observed were not observed in the single-ascending dose study or anticipated based on pre-clinical models. 

Results of Operations 

Manufacturing and Royalty Revenues 

Manufacturing fees are earned for the manufacture of products under arrangements with our collaborators when product is shipped to them at an agreed upon price. Royalties are earned on our collaborators' sales of products that incorporate our technologies. Royalties are generally recognized in the period the products are sold by our collaborators. The following table compares manufacturing and royalty revenues earned in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:                                                                             

The increase in INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA royalty revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due to an increase in Janssen s end-market sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Janssen s end-market sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA were $556.0 million and $1,629.0 million, as compared to $459.0 million and $1,306.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Under our agreement with Janssen, we earn royalty revenues on end-market net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA of: 5% on calendar-year net sales up to $250 million; 7% on calendar-year net sales of between $250 million and $500 million; and 9% on calendar-year net sales exceeding $500 million. The royalty rate resets to 5% at the beginning of each calendar year.

The decrease in AMPYRA/FAMPYRA manufacturing and royalty revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a 36%  decrease in the amount of AMPYRA we shipped to Acorda and a decrease in the amount of revenue we earned on product shipped to Acorda by a third-party manufacturer. The decrease in AMPYRA/FAMPYRA manufacturing and royalty revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of revenue we earned on product shipped to Acorda by a third-party manufacturer. Under our supply and license agreements with Acorda, we earn manufacturing and royalty revenues when AMPYRA is shipped to Acorda, either by us or a third-party manufacturer. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we earned none and $8.8 million of revenue from product shipped to Acorda by a third-party manufacturer, respectively, as compared to $5.4 million and $17.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The decrease in RISPERDAL CONSTA manufacturing and royalty revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a decrease in Janssen s end market sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA and a decrease in the price we earned on shipments of RISPERDAL CONSTA to Janssen. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Janssen s end market sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA were   $222.0 million and $683.0 million, respectively,   as compared to $235.0 million and $736.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Manufacturing revenues decreased by 13% and 10% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, which was primarily due to an 11% and 14% decrease in price during these respective periods.   

The difference in BYDUREON royalty revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due to end-market sales of BYDUREON by AstraZeneca. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, AstraZeneca s end-market sales of BYDUREON were $144.7 million and $434.1 million, respectively, as compared to $161.3 million and $424.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The divested products relate to products sold as part of the Gainesville Transaction. 

Product Sales, net 

Our product sales, net consist of sales of VIVITROL and, following its approval by the FDA in October 2015, ARISTADA in the U.S., primarily to wholesalers, specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. The following table presents the adjustments deducted from product sales, gross to arrive at product sales, net for sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:                                                                   

The increase in product sales, gross for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a 66% and 65% increase in the number of VIVITROL units sold, respectively, and the addition of gross sales from ARISTADA, which was first commercialized in October 2015. The increase in the amount of Medicaid rebates as a percentage of sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, was primarily due to an increase in the amount of VIVITROL sold under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Goods Manufactured and Sold 

The increase in the cost of goods manufactured and sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to an increase in sales of VIVITROL and the addition of ARISTADA sales,   partially offset by a decrease in costs of goods manufactured for AMPYRA/FAMPYRA.   The decrease in cost of goods manufactured and sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to the Gainesville Transaction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Gainesville facility had cost of goods manufactured of $10.2 million.   This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cost of goods sold for VIVITROL and ARISTADA. 

Research and Development Expense 

For each of our R D programs, we incur both external and internal expenses. External R D expenses include costs related to clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, consulting fees, laboratory services, purchases of drug product materials and third-party manufacturing development costs. Internal R D expenses include employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, depreciation and general overhead. We track external R D expenses for each of our development programs; however, internal R D expenses are not tracked by individual program as they benefit multiple programs or our technologies in general. 

The following table sets forth our external R D expenses relating to our individual Key Development Programs and all other development programs, and our internal R D expenses by the nature of such expenses: 

These amounts are not necessarily predictive of future R D expenses. In an effort to allocate our spending most effectively, we continually evaluate the products under development, based on the performance of such products in pre-clinical and/or clinical trials, our expectations regarding the likelihood of their regulatory approval and our view of their commercial viability, among other factors.  

The increase in expenses related to ALKS 3831 was primarily due to the ENLIGHTEN-1 and ENLIGHTEN-2 pivotal trials, which were initiated in December 2015 and February 2016, respectively. The decrease in expenses related

Table of Contents  

to ALKS 5461, in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, was primarily due to the timing of the three core phase 3 studies related to the program. We announced the results of the FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 studies in January 2016 and topline results from FORWARD-5 were announced in October 2016. The increase in expenses related to ARISTADA and ARISTADA line extension programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, was primarily due to the timing of the phase 1 clinical study of extended dosing intervals of aripiprazole lauroxil in patients with schizophrenia. Based on the results of this study, we submitted a sNDA to the FDA in August 2016. The increase in expenses related to ALKS 6428, in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, was primarily due to the initiation of the phase 3 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ALKS 6428 in patients with opioid dependence in September 2015. The increase in expenses related to ALKS 8700 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to the timing of the two-year, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety of ALKS 8700, which was initiated in December 2015. The $10.0 million non-refundable, upfront payment made to Reset was partial consideration of a grant to us of rights and licenses pursuant to a collaboration and license option agreement with Reset. Expenses incurred under the ALKS 7119 and ALKS 4230 development programs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were not material. 

The increase in employee-related expenses was primarily due to an increase in R D headcount of 22% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expense 

The increase in SG A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015,   primarily relates to an increase in employee-related expenses of $29.1 million and marketing and professional service fees of $21.2 million.   The increase in employee-related expenses was due to an increase in headcount, as we increased the size of our commercial operations team in anticipation of the launch of ARISTADA in October 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our SG A headcount increased by 88%, with the most significant increases occurring during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, our SG A headcount has increased by an additional 10% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The increase in marketing and professional service fees was primarily due to the commercialization of ARISTADA commencing in October 2015.  

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets 

The intangible assets being amortized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were acquired as part of the acquisition of Elan Drug Technologies ( EDT ) in September 2011. In connection with the acquisition of EDT, we acquired certain amortizable intangible assets with a fair value of $643.2 million, which were expected to be amortized over 12 to 13 years. We amortize our amortizable intangible assets using the economic use method, which reflects the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed as revenue is generated from the underlying patent or contract.  

Based on our most recent analysis, amortization of intangible assets included within our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 is expected to be approximately $60.0 million, $60.0 million, $60.0 million, $55.0 million and $50.0 million in the years ending December 31, 2016 through 2020, respectively.

Other (Expense) Income, Net 

The proceeds from the Gainesville Transaction included contingent consideration tied   to low double digit royalties on net sales of the Meloxicam Products and up to $120.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the Meloxicam Products.   We determined the fair value of the contingent consideration through three valuation approaches, which are described in greater detail in Note 3,   Divestiture  , in the  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Statements  in this Form 10-Q.   We update our assessment of the fair value of this contingent consideration at each reporting date and   reflect any changes to the fair value within  Change in the fair value of contingent consideration  in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss until the milestones and/or royalties included in the contingent consideration have been settled. The decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a delay in the timing of future clinical events, partially offset by a shorter time to payment on the milestones and royalties included in the contingent consideration. The increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a shorter time to payment on the milestones and royalties included in the contingent consideration, partially offset by a delay in the timing of future clinical events. 

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 

The income tax (benefit) provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily relates to U.S. federal and state taxes. The favorable change in income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding prior periods, was due to a reduction in income earned in the U.S. 

Liquidity and Financial Condition 

Our financial condition is summarized as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, our investments consisted of the following: 

29 

Table of Contents  

Our investment objectives are, first, to preserve liquidity and conserve capital and, second, to generate investment income. We mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. However, the value of these securities may be adversely affected by the instability of the global financial markets, which could, in turn, adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity. Our available-for-sale investments consist primarily of short- and long-term U.S. government and agency debt securities, debt securities issued by foreign agencies and backed by foreign governments and corporate debt securities. Our held-to-maturity investments consist of investments that are restricted and held as collateral under certain letters of credit related to certain of our lease agreements. 

We classify available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position, which do not mature within 12 months, as long-term investments. Available-for-sale investments in an unrealized gain position are classified as short-term investments, regardless of maturity date. We have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery, which may be at maturity, and it is more-likely-than-not that we would not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost. At September 30, 2016, we performed an analysis of our investments with unrealized losses for impairment and determined that they were temporarily impaired. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

We expect that our existing cash and investment balance will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements, such as capital expenditures and principal and interest payments, for at least the next twelve months. Subject to market conditions, interest rates and other factors, we may pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets or other financing methods or structures. 

Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the  Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The increase in cash flows used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a 17% increase in cash paid to our suppliers and a 28% increase in cash paid to our employees, partially offset by a 10% increase in cash received from our customers. The increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees was primarily due to the increase in our R D activity, the commercialization of ARISTADA and an increase in our R D and SG A headcount, as previously discussed.  

The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to a $211.8 million increase in the net sales of investments. This was partially offset by a $15.0 million investment we made in Reset in February 2016 and the proceeds from the Gainesville Transaction of $50.3 million in April 2015.  

The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to the $60.9 million principal payment we made for Term Loan B-2, which matured on September 25, 2016. In addition, there was a decrease of $10.3 million in cash received from our employees from the exercise of stock options, net of amounts withheld for taxes, and a $28.2 million decrease in excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. 

Borrowings 

At September 30, 2016, our borrowings consisted of $288.0 million outstanding under our Term Loan Facility.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Market risks related to our investment portfolio, and the ways we manage such risks, are summarized in  Part II, Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  of our Annual Report. We regularly review our marketable securities holdings and shift our investment holdings to those that best meet our investment objectives, which are, first, to preserve liquidity and conserve capital and, second, to generate investment income. Apart from such adjustments to our investment portfolio, there have been no material changes to our market risks since December 31, 2015, and we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in our management's objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. 

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to manufacturing and royalty revenues we receive on certain of our products partially offset by certain operating costs arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled predominantly in euro. These foreign currency exchange rate risks are summarized in  Part II, Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  of our Annual Report. There has been no material change in our assessment of our sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since December 31, 2015.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures   

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), on September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings   

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of any such proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. For a description of risks relating to these and other legal proceedings we face, see  Part I, Item 1A   Risk Factors  of our Annual Report. 

ARISTADA 

On July 13, 2015, Otsuka PD C filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA which requested that the FDA refuse to approve the NDA for ARISTADA or delay approval of such NDA until the exclusivity rights covering long-acting aripiprazole expire in December 2017. The FDA approved ARISTADA on October 5, 2015 and, concurrent with such approval, denied Otsuka PD C s Citizen Petition. 

On October 15, 2015, Otsuka filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief with the DC Court against Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Dr. Stephen Ostroff, Acting Commissioner, FDA; and the FDA, requesting that the DC Court (a) expedite the legal proceedings; (b) declare that the FDA s denial of Otsuka s claimed exclusivity rights and approval of the ARISTADA NDA were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law; (c) vacate FDA s approval of the ARISTADA NDA and vacate any FDA decisions or actions underlying or supporting or predicated upon that approval; (d) declare that Otsuka s claimed exclusivity rights preclude FDA from granting approval of the Alkermes NDA until the expiration of such exclusivity rights in December 2017; and (e) grant any and all other, further, and additional relief, including all necessary and appropriate protective preliminary, interim, or permanent relief, as the nature of the cause may require, including all necessary and appropriate declarations of rights and injunctive relief. The Company successfully intervened in, and received the DC Court s approval to become a party to, this action.  

On July 28, 2016, the DC Court issued an unambiguous opinion in favor of Alkermes and the FDA, affirming in all respects FDA s decision to approve ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and denying the action filed by Otsuka for declaratory and injunctive relief.   Otsuka has filed an appeal of the DC Court s decision with the DC Circuit asking the DC Circuit to reverse the DC Court s decision, vacate FDA s approval of the ARISTADA NDA and remand the case to the DC Court for consideration of any appropriate equitable remedy for Otsuka s lost exclusivity  . The DC Circuit has scheduled this appellate hearing for December 12, 2016. The Company believes Otsuka s action is without

merit and will continue to vigorously defend ARISTADA against such action.   For information about risks relating to this action, see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the section entitled  Citizen Petitions and other actions filed with, or litigation against, the FDA or other regulatory agencies or litigation against Alkermes may negatively impact the approval of our products and our business.  

AMPYRA 

AMPYRA ANDA Litigation 

Ten separate Paragraph IV Certification Notices have been submitted to us and/or the Company s licensee Acorda from Accord; Actavis; Alkem; Apotex, Inc.; Aurobindo; Mylan; Par; Roxane Laboratories, Inc.; Sun; and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., advising that each of these companies had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of the Orange Book-listed patents for AMPYRA, and they have also asserted that their generic versions do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In response, the Company and/or Acorda filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers in the Delaware Court asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,540,938 (which the Company owns), 8,663,685; 8,440,703; 8,354,437 and 8,007,826 (which are owned by Acorda). Requested judicial remedies include recovery of litigation costs and injunctive relief. Lawsuits with eight of the ANDA filers have been consolidated into a single case. The Delaware Court held a bench trial that concluded on September 23, 2016. Mylan is challenging the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court with respect to the Delaware action. Due to Mylan s motion to dismiss, the Company, together with Acorda, also filed another patent infringement suit against Mylan in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia asserting the same U.S. patents and requesting the same judicial relief as in the Delaware action. In March 2016, the Federal Circuit upheld the Delaware Court s ruling that the litigation against Mylan can continue in the Delaware Court. In June 2016, the Federal Circuit denied Mylan s request for a rehearing to reconsider its previous ruling. Mylan has appealed the Federal Circuit s decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. All lawsuits were filed within 45 days from the date of receipt of each of the Paragraph IV Certification Notices. As a result, a 30-month statutory stay of approval period applies to each of the ANDAs under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The 30-month stay starts from January 22, 2015, which is the end of the new chemical entity exclusivity period for AMPYRA. This stay restricts the FDA from approving the ANDAs until July 2017 at the earliest, unless a Federal district court issues a decision adverse to all of the asserted Orange Book-listed patents prior to that date. Such FDA approval would permit the ANDA filers to market generic versions of AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. 

The Company and/or Acorda has entered into a settlement agreement with each of the Settling ANDA Filers to resolve the patent litigation that the Company and/or Acorda brought against the Settling ANDA Filers in the Delaware Court as described above. As a result of the settlement agreements, the Settling ANDA Filers will be permitted to market a generic version of AMPYRA in the U.S. at a specified date in 2027, or potentially earlier under certain circumstances. The parties have submitted their respective settlement agreements to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as required by federal law. The settlements with the Settling ANDA Filers do not resolve pending patent litigation that the Company and Acorda brought against the other ANDA filers, as described above.  

The Company intends to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights. For information about risks relating to the AMPYRA Paragraph IV litigations and other proceedings see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the section entitled  We face claims against our intellectual property rights and competition from generic drug manufacturers.  

AMPYRA IPR Proceedings 

A hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) has filed IPR petitions with the USPTO, challenging U.S. Patent Nos.   8,663,685; 8,440,703; 8,354,437 and 8,007,826   (which are owned by Acorda). In March 2016, the USPTO s Patent Trials and Appeal Board instituted the IPR. A ruling on the IPR petitions is expected within one year of the IPR s institution. The challenged patents are four of the five AMPYRA Orange-Book listed patents. The 30-month statutory stay period based on patent infringement suits filed by us and Acorda against ANDA filers is not impacted by these filings, and remains in effect.

BYDUREON, RISPERDAL CONSTA AND VIVITROL IPR Proceedings 

On June 3, 2016 the USPTO accepted two separate IPR petitions filed by Luye challenging the  061 Patent, which is an Orange Book-listed patent for each of BYDUREON, RISPERDAL CONSTA and VIVITROL. On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a response to Luye s IPR petitions with the USPTO, following which the USPTO has a further three-month period to decide whether or not to institute a review of the challenged claims of the  061 Patent. If such review is instituted, a decision on the matter would be expected, pursuant to the statutory time frame, within one year of the USPTO s decision to institute such review.  

The Company opposed Luye s requests to institute the IPRs against the  061 Patent. If the USPTO institutes such challenge, the Company will vigorously defend the  061 Patent. For information about risks relating to the  061 Patent IPR proceedings see  Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report and specifically the sections entitled  Patent protection for our products is important and uncertain  and  Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable .

Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

On September 16, 2011, our board of directors authorized the continuation of the Alkermes, Inc. program to repurchase up to $215.0 million of our ordinary shares at the discretion of management from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We did not purchase any shares under this program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had purchased a total of 8,866,342 shares at a cost of $114.0 million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016,   we acquired 161,921 Alkermes ordinary shares, at an average price of $45.27 per share, in connection with the vesting of employee equity awards to satisfy withholding tax obligations.

Exhibit 10.1 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 

This Employment Agreement ( Agreement ) is made as of the ____ day of DATE 20__ between Alkermes, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the  Company ), and NAME of __________, _________ ( Executive ). 

WHEREAS, the Company has previously entered into an Employment Agreement with Executive dated DATE, as amended on DATE (the  VP Agreement ); 

WHEREAS, the Company and Executive wish to replace the VP Agreement with the provisions set forth herein; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

1.    Employment  .  The term of this Agreement shall extend from DATE (the  Commencement Date ) until this Agreement is terminated by either the Executive or the Company pursuant to Paragraph 4.  The term of this Agreement may be referred to herein as the  Period of Employment.   

2.    Position and Duties  .  During the Period of Employment, Executive shall serve as Senior Vice President, TITLE, Alkermes, Inc. , and shall have supervision and control over and responsibility for the day-to-day business and affairs of those functions and operations of the Company and shall have such other powers and duties as may from time to time be prescribed by the Board of Directors (the  Board ) of Alkermes plc, the parent company of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer of Alkermes plc (the  CEO ), or other authorized executives, provided that such duties are consistent with Executive s position or other positions that he/she may hold from time to time.  Executive shall devote his/her full working time and efforts to the business and affairs of the Company.   

3.    Compensation and Related Matters  . 

(a)    Base Salary  .  Executive s initial annual base salary shall be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the  Compensation Committee ).  Executive s base salary shall be redetermined annually by the Compensation Committee.  The base salary in effect at any given time is referred to herein as  Base Salary.   The Base Salary shall be payable in substantially equal bi-weekly installments. 

(b)    Incentive Compensation  .  Executive shall be eligible to receive cash incentive compensation as determined by the Compensation Committee from time to time, and shall also be eligible to participate in such incentive compensation plans as the Compensation Committee shall determine from time to time.  

(c)    Expenses  .  Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable business expenses incurred by him/her in performing services hereunder during the Period of Employment, in accordance with the policies and procedures then in effect and established by the Company. 

(d)    Other Benefits  .  During the Period of Employment, Executive shall be entitled to continue to participate in or receive benefits under all of the Company s Employee Benefit Plans in effect on the date hereof, as these plans or arrangements may thereafter be amended from time to time.  As used herein, the term  Employee Benefit Plans  includes, without limitation, each pension and retirement plan; supplemental pension, retirement and deferred compensation plan; savings and profit-sharing plan; stock ownership plan; stock purchase plan; stock option plan; life insurance plan; medical insurance plan; disability plan; and health and accident plan or arrangement established and maintained by the Company on the date hereof for employees of the same status within the hierarchy of the Company.  Executive shall have the right in accordance with applicable law and the Company s long-term disability plan to elect to pay the premiums for his/her disability coverage with after-tax dollars.  During the Period of Employment, Executive shall be entitled to participate in or receive benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan or arrangement which may, in the future, be made available by the Company to its executives and key management employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the terms, conditions and overall administration of such plan or arrangement.  Any payments or benefits payable to Executive under a plan or arrangement referred to in this Subparagraph 3(d) in respect of any calendar year during which Executive is employed by the Company for less than the whole of such year shall, unless otherwise provided in the applicable plan or arrangement, be prorated in accordance with the number of days in such calendar year during which he/she is so employed.  Should any such payments or benefits accrue on a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) basis, then the proration in the preceding sentence shall be on the basis of a fiscal year rather than calendar year. 

(e)    Vacations  .  Executive shall be entitled to paid vacation time in each calendar year in accordance with Company policy, which vacation days shall be accrued ratably during the calendar year and the number of which may be increased in accordance with Company policies.

4.    Termination  .  Executive s employment hereunder may be terminated without any breach of this Agreement under the following circumstances: 

(a)    Death  .  Executive s employment hereunder shall terminate upon his/her  death. 

(b)    Disability  .  If Executive is prevented from performing his/her duties hereunder by reason of any physical or mental incapacity that results in Executive s satisfaction of all requirements necessary to receive benefits under the Company s long-term disability plan due to a total disability, then, to the extent permitted by law, Company may terminate the employment of Executive at or after such time.  Nothing in this Subparagraph 4(b) shall be construed to waive Executive s rights, if any, under existing law including, without limitation, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C.  2601 et seq. and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq.   

(c)    Termination by Company for Cause  .  At any time during the Period of Employment, the Company may terminate Executive s employment hereunder for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean:  (i) conduct by Executive constituting a   

2 

material act of willful misconduct in connection with the performance of his/her duties, including, without limitation, misappropriation of funds or property of the Company or any of its affiliates other than the occasional, customary and de minimis use of Company property for personal purposes; (ii) the commission by Executive of a felony or any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud, or conduct by Executive that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury to the Company if he/she were retained in his/her position; (iii) continued, willful and deliberate non-performance by Executive of his/her duties hereunder (other than by reason of Executive s physical or mental illness, incapacity or disability) which has continued for more than thirty (30) days following written notice of such non-performance from the Company; (iv) a breach by Executive of any of the provisions contained in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement; (v) a violation by Executive of the Company s employment policies which has continued following written notice of such violation from the Company; or (vi) willful failure to cooperate with a bona fide internal investigation or an investigation by regulatory or law enforcement authorities, after being instructed by the Company to cooperate, or the willful destruction or failure to preserve documents or other materials known to be relevant to such investigation or the willful inducement of others to fail to cooperate or to produce documents or other materials. 

(d)    Termination Without Cause  .  At any time during the Period of Employment, the Company may terminate Executive s employment hereunder without Cause.  Any termination by the Company of Executive s employment under this Agreement which does not constitute a termination for Cause under Subparagraph 4(c) or result from the death or disability of Executive under Subparagraph 4(a) or (b) shall be deemed a termination without Cause; provided that, Executive s employment shall not be deemed terminated under this Subparagraph 4(d) if he/she remains employed by an affiliate of the Company. 

(e)    Termination by Executive  .  At any time during the Period of Employment, Executive may terminate his/her employment hereunder for any reason, including but not limited to Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall mean that Executive has complied with the  Good Reason Process  (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any of the following events:  (i) a substantial diminution or other substantive adverse change, not consented to by Executive, in the nature or scope of Executive s responsibilities, authorities, powers, functions or duties; (ii) an involuntary material reduction in Executive s Base Salary except for across-the-board reductions similarly affecting all or substantially all management employees; (iii) a breach by the Company of any of its other material obligations under this Agreement, or (iv) a material change in the geographic location at which Executive must perform his/her services; provided that, a change in the employment of Executive to another affiliate of Company does not in and of itself constitute  Good Reason.    Good Reason Process  shall mean that (A) Executive reasonably determines in good faith that a  Good Reason  event has occurred; (B) Executive notifies the Company in writing of the occurrence of the Good Reason event within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of such event; (C) Executive cooperates in good faith with the Company s efforts, for a period not less than thirty (30) days following such notice, to modify Executive s employment situation in a manner acceptable to Executive and Company; (D) notwithstanding such efforts, one or more of the Good Reason events continues to exist and has not been modified in a manner acceptable to Executive; and (E) Executive terminates his/her  employment no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the thirty-  

3 

day cure period.  If the Company cures the Good Reason event in a manner acceptable to Executive during the thirty-day period, Good Reason shall be deemed not to have occurred. 

(f)    Notice of Termination  .  Except for termination as specified in Subparagraph 4(a), any termination of Executive s employment by the Company or any such termination by Executive shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto.  For purposes of this Agreement, a  Notice of Termination  shall mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon. 

(g)    Date of Termination  .   Date of Termination  shall mean:  (i) if Executive s employment is terminated by his/her death, the date of his/her death; (ii) if Executive s employment is terminated on account of disability under Subparagraph 4(b) or by the Company for Cause under Subparagraph 4(c), the date on which Notice of Termination is given; (iii) if Executive s employment is terminated by the Company under Subparagraph 4(d), thirty (30) days after the date on which a Notice of Termination is given; and (iv) if Executive s employment is terminated by Executive under Subparagraph 4(e), thirty (30) days after the date on which a Notice of Termination is given. 

5.    Compensation Upon Termination  . 

(a)    Termination Generally  .  If Executive s employment with the Company is terminated for any reason during the Period of Employment, the Company shall pay or provide to Executive (or to his/her  authorized representative or estate) any earned but unpaid Base Salary, incentive compensation earned but not yet paid, unpaid expense reimbursements, accrued but unused vacation and any vested benefits Executive may have under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company, including without limitation any benefits that may accrue on Executive s retirement from the Company, to the extent applicable (the  Accrued Benefit ). 

(b)    Termination by the Company Without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason  .  If Executive s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause as provided in Subparagraph 4(d), or Executive terminates his/her employment for Good Reason as provided in Subparagraph 4(e), then the Company shall, through the Date of Termination, pay Executive his/her Accrued Benefit. The Company shall within seven (7) days of the Date of Termination provide to Executive a general release of claims in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company (the  Release ).  If Executive signs the Release and delivers it to Company within twenty-one (21) days of Executive s receipt of the Release and does not revoke it within seven (7) days thereafter: 

(i)  Company shall pay Executive an amount equal to one times the sum of Executive s Base Salary and his/her Average Incentive Compensation (the  Severance Amount ).  The Severance Amount shall be paid out in substantially equal bi-weekly installments over twelve (12) months, in arrears beginning on the first payroll date that occurs after thirty-five (35) days from the Date of Termination.  Solely for the purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), each bi-weekly payment is considered a separate payment.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Average Incentive Compensation  shall mean the average of the annual cash incentive compensation under Subparagraph 3(b) received by Executive for   

4 

the two (2) immediately preceding fiscal years.  In no event shall  Average Incentive Compensation  include any sign-on bonus, retention bonus or any other special bonus.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive breaches any of the provisions contained in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, all payments of the Severance Amount shall immediately cease. 

(ii)  Subject to Executive s copayment of premium amounts at the active employees  rate, continued participation in the Company s group health, dental and vision program for twelve (12) months; provided, however, that the continuation of health benefits under this Subparagraph shall reduce and count against Executive s rights under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ( COBRA ). 

(iii)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of Executive s termination of employment, Executive is considered a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, and if any payment or benefit that Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement is considered deferred compensation subject to interest, penalties and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then no such payment shall be payable or benefit shall be provided prior to the date that is the earlier of (A) six months after Executive s separation from service, or (B) Executive s death, and the initial payment shall include a catch-up amount covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the first six-month period but for the application of this Subparagraph 5(b)(iii).  The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.  

(c)   Additional Limitation  . 

(i)         Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the amount of any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, calculated in a manner consistent with Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations thereunder (the  Aggregate Payments ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Aggregate Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the sum of all of the Aggregate Payments shall be $1.00 less than the amount at which the Executive becomes subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code; provided that such reduction shall only occur if it would result in the Executive receiving a higher After Tax Amount (as defined below) than the Executive would receive if the Aggregate Payments were not subject to such reduction.  In such event, the Aggregate Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Aggregate Payments that are to be paid the furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section   

5 

280G of the Code:  (1) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (2) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (3) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (4) non-cash forms of benefits; provided that in the case of all the foregoing Aggregate Payments all amounts or payments that are not subject to calculation under Treas.

6.    Change in Control Payment  .  The provisions of this Paragraph 6 set forth certain terms of an agreement reached between Executive and the Company regarding Executive s rights and obligations upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of Alkermes plc or any successor in interest to Alkermes plc ( Alkermes ).  These provisions are intended to assure and encourage in advance Executive s continued attention and dedication to his/her assigned duties and his/her  objectivity during the pendency and after the occurrence of any such event.  These provisions shall apply in lieu of, and expressly supersede, the provisions of Subparagraph 5(b) regarding the amount of severance pay and benefits upon a termination of employment, if such termination of employment occurs within twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of the first event constituting a Change in Control, provided that such first event occurs during the Period of Employment.  These provisions shall terminate and be of no further force or effect beginning twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of a Change in Control. 

(a)  A  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any one of the following events: 

(i)  any  Person,  as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Act ) (other than Alkermes, any of its subsidiaries, or any trustee, fiduciary or other person or entity holding securities under any employee benefit plan or trust of Alkermes or any of its subsidiaries), together with all  affiliates  and  associates  (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Act) of such   

6 

Person, shall become the  beneficial owner  (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Alkermes representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Alkermes  then outstanding securities having the right to vote in an election of the Board (   Voting Securities   ) (in such case other than as a result of an acquisition of securities directly from Alkermes); or 

(ii)  a majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board before the date of such appointment or election; or 

(iii)  the consummation of (A) any consolidation or merger of Alkermes where the stockholders of Alkermes, immediately prior to the consolidation or merger, would not, immediately after the consolidation or merger, beneficially own (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly, shares representing in the aggregate more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting shares of the company issuing cash or securities in the consolidation or merger (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any), or (B) any sale or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of Alkermes. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  Change in Control  shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause (i) solely as the result of an acquisition of securities by Alkermes that, by reducing the number of shares of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares of Voting Securities beneficially owned by any person to fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that if any person referred to in this sentence shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of Voting Securities (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, or similar transaction or as a result of an acquisition of securities directly from Alkermes) and immediately thereafter beneficially owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding Voting Securities, then a  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause (i). 

(b)    Effect of a Change in Control  .    

(i)  If within twenty-four (24) months after a Change in Control occurs, the Executive s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause as provided in Subparagraph 4(d) or the Executive terminates his/her employment for Good Reason as provided in Subparagraph 4(e), then, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum in cash on the Date of Termination equal to the sum of: 

(A)  to the extent not theretofore paid, an amount equal to the Executive s Base Salary through the Date of Termination; 

7 

(B)  an amount equal to the following formula:  A x (B   365); where A equals Executive s Average Incentive Compensation and B equals the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination; and 

(C)  an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (I) Executive s Base Salary (or Executive s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, if higher) plus (II) Executive s Average Incentive Compensation; and 

(ii)  Subject to Executive s copayment of premium amounts at the active employees  rate, Executive shall continue to participate in the Company s group health, dental and vision program for eighteen (18) months;   provided, however  , that the continuation of health benefits under this Section shall reduce and count against Executive s rights under COBRA. 

(iii)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of Executive s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, Executive is considered a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, and if any payment or benefit that Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement is considered deferred compensation subject to interest, penalties and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then no such payment shall be payable or benefit shall be provided prior to the date that is the earlier of (A) six (6) months and one day after Executive s separation from service, or (B) Executive s death.  The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. 

7.    Confidential Information, Nonsolicitation and Cooperation  . 

(a)    Confidential Information  .  As used in this Agreement,  Confidential Information  means information belonging to the Company or its affiliates which is of value to the Company or its affiliates in the course of conducting their business and the disclosure of which could result in a competitive or other disadvantage to the Company or its affiliates.  Confidential Information includes, without limitation, financial information, reports, and forecasts; inventions, improvements and other intellectual property; trade secrets; know-how; designs, processes or formulae; software; market or sales information or plans; customer lists; and business plans, prospects and opportunities (such as possible acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or facilities) which have been discussed or considered by the management of the Company or its affiliates.  Confidential Information includes information developed by Executive in the course of Executive s employment by the Company or its affiliates, as well as other information to which Executive may have access in connection with Executive s employment.  Confidential Information also includes the confidential information of others with which the Company or its affiliates has a business relationship.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,   

8 

Confidential Information does not include information in the public domain, unless due to breach of Executive s duties under Subparagraph 7(b). 

(b)    Confidentiality  .  Executive understands and agrees that Executive s employment creates a relationship of confidence and trust between Executive and the Company with respect to all Confidential Information.  At all times, both during Executive s employment with the Company or its affiliates and after its termination, Executive will keep in confidence and trust all such Confidential Information, and will not use or disclose any such Confidential Information without the written consent of the Company, except as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing Executive s duties to the Company or its affiliates. Notwithstanding the above, (i) pursuant to the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive s disclosure of a  trade secret  (as defined herein) (A) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal, and (ii) Executive s disclosure of Confidential Information to any governmental agency or entity to report possible violations of federal law or regulation or Executive s making of other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation will not constitute a violation of this Section 7.  For purpose of the above sentence trade secret shall be defined as all forms and types of information that the Company has taken reasonable measures to keep secret and where such information derives actual or potential independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information. 

(c)    Documents, Records, etc  .  All documents, records, data, apparatus, equipment and other physical property, whether or not pertaining to Confidential Information, which are furnished to Executive by the Company or its affiliates or are produced by Executive in connection with Executive s employment will be and remain the sole property of the Company and/or its affiliate.  Executive will return to the Company all such materials and property as and when requested by the Company.  In any event, Executive will return all such materials and property immediately upon termination of Executive s employment for any reason.  Executive will not retain with Executive any such material or property or any copies thereof after such termination. 

(d)    Nonsolicitation  .  During the Period of Employment and for one (1) year thereafter, Executive (i) will refrain from directly or indirectly recruiting or otherwise soliciting, inducing or influencing any person to leave employment with the Company or its affiliates (other than terminations of employment of subordinate employees undertaken in the course of Executive s employment with the Company or its affiliates); and (ii) will refrain from soliciting or encouraging any customer or supplier to terminate or otherwise modify adversely its business relationship with the Company or the Company s affiliates.  However, nothing in this Subparagraph 7(d) will prohibit Executive from indirectly recruiting, soliciting, inducing or influencing a person to leave employment with the Company or its affiliates through the use of advertisements in trade journals and the like or from discussing employment opportunities with such employees to the extent such employees contact Executive first.  Executive understands that the restrictions set forth in this Subparagraph 7(d) are intended to protect the Company s and its affiliates  interests in their Confidential Information and established employee, customer and   

9 

supplier relationships and goodwill, and agrees that such restrictions are reasonable and appropriate for such purpose.   

(e)    Litigation and Regulatory Cooperation  .  During and after Executive s employment, Executive shall cooperate fully with the Company and its affiliates in the defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company or its affiliates which relate to events or occurrences that transpired while Executive was employed by the Company or its affiliates.  Executive s full cooperation in connection with such claims or actions shall include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to act as a witness on behalf of the Company or its affiliates at mutually convenient times.  During and after Executive s employment, Executive also shall cooperate fully with the Company and its affiliates in connection with any investigation or review of any federal, state or local regulatory authority as any such investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired while Executive was employed by the Company or its affiliates.  The Company shall reimburse Executive for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Executive s performance of obligations pursuant to this Subparagraph 7(e). 

(f)    Injunction  .  Executive agrees that it would be difficult to measure any damages caused to the Company and its affiliates which might result from any breach by Executive of the promises set forth in this Paragraph 7, and that in any event money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such breach.  Accordingly, subject to Paragraph 9 of this Agreement, Executive agrees that if Executive breaches, or proposes to breach, any portion of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies that it may have, to an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief to restrain any such breach without showing or proving any actual damage to the Company or its affiliates. 

8.    Arbitration of Disputes  .   Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof or otherwise arising out of Executive s employment or the termination of that employment (including, without limitation, any claims of unlawful employment discrimination whether based on age or otherwise) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be settled by arbitration in any forum and form agreed upon by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) in Boston, Massachusetts in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the AAA, including, but not limited to, the rules and procedures applicable to the selection of arbitrators.  In the event that any person or entity other than Executive or the Company may be a party with regard to any such controversy or claim, such controversy or claim shall be submitted to arbitration subject to such other person or entity s agreement.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  This Paragraph 8 shall be specifically enforceable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Paragraph 8 shall not preclude either party from pursuing a court action for the sole purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction in circumstances in which such relief is appropriate; provided that any other relief shall be pursued through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Paragraph 8. 

9.    Consent to Jurisdiction  .  To the extent that any court action is permitted consistent with or to enforce Paragraphs 7 or 8 of this Agreement, the parties hereby consent to the   

10 

jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Accordingly, with respect to any such court action, Executive (i) submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (ii) consents to service of process; and (iii) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction or service of process. 

10.    Integration  .  This Agreement, the Deed of Indemnification dated as of DATE and the Employee Agreement with respect to Inventions and Proprietary Information dated DATE between the Company and Executive, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements between the parties with respect to any related subject matter.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to the extent in conflict therewith, this Agreement does not supersede the Employee Agreement with respect to Inventions and Proprietary Information dated DATE between Executive and the Company. 

11.    Assignment  ; Successors and Assigns.  Neither the Company nor Executive may make any assignment of this Agreement or any interest herein, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party; provided that the Company may assign its rights under this Agreement without the consent of Executive in the event that the Company shall effect a reorganization, consolidate with or merge into any other corporation, partnership, organization or other entity, or transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any other corporation, partnership, organization or other entity.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and Executive, their respective successors, executors, administrators, heirs and permitted assigns. 

12.    Enforceability  . If any portion or provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any section of this Agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

13.    Waiver  .  No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party.  The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. 

14.    Notices  .  Any notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and delivered in person or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to Executive at the last address Executive has filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its main offices, attention Head of Human Resources, and shall be effective on the date of delivery in person or by courier or three (3) days after the date mailed.

16.    Legal Expenses  .

17.    Governing Law  .  This is a Massachusetts contract and shall be construed under and be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles of such Commonwealth.

Each such notice shall specify (i) the date (each, a    Term Loan Increase Effective Date   ) on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the identity of each Person (which, if not a Lender, an Approved Fund or an Affiliate of a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment be allocated and the amounts of such allocations (it being understood that no existing Lender will have an obligation to make a portion of any Incremental Term Loan).  

(b)    Conditions.  The Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall become effective, as of such Term Loan Increase Effective Date;   provided   that:  

(i)    each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 shall be satisfied;  

(ii)    no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing or would result from the borrowings to be made on the Term Loan Increase Effective Date; and

(ii)    the weighted average life to maturity of all new Incremental Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the 2016 Term Loans;  

(iii)    the maturity date of Incremental Term Loans shall not be earlier than the 2016 Term Loan Maturity Date; and  

(iv)    the applicable yield for the Incremental Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable new Lenders;   provided  , however, that the applicable yield (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to include all upfront or similar fees, original issue discount (with original issue discount being equated to interest based on an assumed four-year life to maturity) or  LIBOR Rate or ABR  floors  (with any increase in such floors being equated to an increase in interest rate) payable to all Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans, but shall exclude customary arrangement fees payable to any arranger in connection with the Incremental Term Loans) for the Incremental Term Loans shall not be greater than the highest applicable yield that may, under any circumstances, be payable with respect to each Tranche of then outstanding Term Loans plus 50 basis points, except to the extent that the applicable yield of each Tranche of Term Loans is increased to the extent necessary to achieve the foregoing; provided that in the event the weighted average life to maturity of the Incremental Term Loans is equal to or greater than the weighted average life to maturity of the     2019    2021   Term Loans, the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to the 2016 Term Loans.  

The Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the    Increase Term Joinder   ) executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Incremental Lender making such Incremental Term Loan Commitment, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them.  The Increase Term Joinder may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.4.  In addition, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in the Loan Documents to Term Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include references to Incremental Term Loans that are Term Loans made pursuant to this Agreement. 

(d)    Making of Incremental Term Loans.  On any Term Loan Increase Effective Date on which Incremental Term Loan Commitments are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each Incremental Lender of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall make an Incremental Term Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Loan Commitment.  

(e)    Equal and Ratable Benefit.  The Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall constitute Term Loans and Commitments under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from security interests created by the Security Documents and the guarantees of the Guarantors.  The Loan Parties shall take any actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the Lien and security interests granted by the Security Documents continue to be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise after giving effect to the establishment of any such class of Incremental Term Loans or any such Incremental Term Loan Commitments.

The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor);   provided   that no ABR Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.  

(b)    Any LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term   Interest Period   set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans;   provided   that no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations; and   provided  , further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.     

Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.

(c)    If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal or interest on any Term Loan or any other amount becoming due hereunder, by acceleration or otherwise, or under any other Loan Document (or including, as a result of an Event of Default under Sections 8(a) or (f)), the Borrower shall pay interest on any such defaulted amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of Term Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2%, and (ii) in the case of any such other amounts, the non default rate then applicable to ABR Loans plus 2%.  

(d)    Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date;   provided   that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.  

(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the    Maximum Rate   ).  If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Term Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.  

(b)    Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, promptly deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 3.6(a).  

3.7    Inability to Determine Interest Rate  .  If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:  

(a)    the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, or  

(b)    the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as reasonably determined and conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,  

the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter but at least two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period.  If such notice is given (x) any Term Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (y) any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to withdraw promptly upon a determination that the condition or situation which gave rise to such notice no longer exists), no further LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans. 

3.8    Pro Rata Treatment; Application of Payments; Payments  .  

(a)    Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Term Percentages of the relevant Lenders.  

(b)    Except for optional prepayments pursuant to Section 3.1 and prepayments pursuant to Section 10.6(b)(v)(C), each payment (including each prepayment) on account of principal of and interest on the Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of each Tranche of the Term Loans then held by the Lenders.  Optional prepayments pursuant to Section 3.1 shall be applied ratably to the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche of Term Loans specified by the Borrower in the applicable notice of prepayment.  The amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the then remaining installments of the Term Loans as specified by the Borrower in the applicable notice of prepayment.  Amounts repaid or prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.  

(c)    All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.  

(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount.  If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.  

(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Section 3.8 shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require or permit differing payments to be made to Non Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.  

3.9    Requirements of Law  .  

(a)    If the adoption of, taking effect of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the administration, interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Restatement Effective Date  (and, for purposes of this Agreement, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and adopted subsequent to the Restatement Effective Date):  

(i)    shall subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever (other than Excluded Taxes (including any change in the rate of any Excluded Tax), Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.10, and any Tax imposed on or measured by the net income of any Lender), with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document;  

(ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or  

(iii)    shall impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender;  

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or, with respect to Taxes under clause (i) above, any Term Loan, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled and setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs. 

(b)    If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of, taking effect of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Restatement Effective Date (and, for purposes of this Agreement, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, guidelines or directives in connection therewith are deemed to have gone into effect and adopted subsequent to the Restatement Effective Date) shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a    

written request therefor setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.  

(c)    A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor;   provided   that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such one hundred and eighty (180) day period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  The Borrower shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any certificate referred to above within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  

3.10    Taxes  .  

(a)    Payments Free of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes  .  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes,   provided   that if any applicable withholding agent shall be required by applicable law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions or withholdings (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings have been made (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.10(a)) the applicable Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.  

(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower  .  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, except for any Other Taxes imposed on any assignment of or participation with respect to a Lender s rights or obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 10.6 if such Tax is imposed as a result of the Lender having a present or former connection with the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than a connection arising solely from having executed, delivered, enforced, become a party to, performed its obligations, received payments, received or perfected a security interest under, and/or engaged in any other transaction pursuant to, any Loan Document).  

(c)    Indemnification by the Borrower  .  Without duplication of Section 3.10(a), the Borrower shall indemnify each Agent and Lender, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including    

Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.10(c)) imposed on or payable by such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability (together with a copy of any applicable documents from the IRS or other Governmental Authority that asserts such claim) delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the relevant Agent), or by an Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  If the Borrower reasonably believes that there is an appropriate basis to pursue a refund (whether received in cash or applied as an offset against other Taxes due) of any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax indemnified by the Borrower under this Section 3.10(c), or for which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts under Section 3.10(a), the affected Agent or Lender (as applicable) shall, upon the Borrower s written request and at the Borrower s expense, pursue such refund;   provided   that no Agent or Lender shall be obligated to pursue any such refund if such Agent or Lender determines in good faith that it would be materially disadvantaged or prejudiced, or subject to any unreimbursed cost or expense, by pursuing such refund.  Any refund described in the preceding sentence that is received by any Agent or Lender shall be payable to the Borrower to the extent provided in Section 3.10(h).  

(d)    Evidence of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.  

(e)    Status of Lenders  .  Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, whenever reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable laws and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, (A) to determine whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) to determine, if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction and (C) to establish such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender pursuant to any Loan Document or otherwise to establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in an applicable jurisdiction.  If any form, certification or other documentation provided by a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.10(e) (including any of the specific documentation described below) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing and shall promptly update or otherwise correct the affected documentation or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing that such Lender is not legally eligible to do so.  

(f)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  

(A)  any Lender that is a  United States person  within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent duly   

completed and executed originals of IRS Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (in such number of signed originals as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to U.S. federal backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and 

(B)  each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of signed originals as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable: 

(i)    IRS Form W-8BEN     or W-8BEN-E   (or any successor thereto) claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party;  

(ii)    IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor thereto) claiming that specified payments (as applicable) under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (as applicable) constitute income that is effectively connected with such Foreign Lender s conduct of a trade or business in the United States;  

(iii)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Sections 881(c) or 871(h) of the Code (the    Portfolio Interest Exemption   ), (x) a certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, D-2, D-3 or D-4, as applicable (a    Tax Status Certificate   ), to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a  10 percent shareholder  of  the Borrower, within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (C) a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no interest to be received is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and (y) IRS Form W-8BEN (or any successor thereto);  

(iv)    where such Lender is a partnership (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or otherwise not a beneficial owner (  e.g  ., where such Lender has sold a participation), IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto) and all required supporting documentation (including, where one or more of the underlying beneficial owner(s) is claiming the benefits of the Portfolio Interest Exemption, a Tax Status Certificate of such beneficial owner(s) (  provided   that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and not a participating Lender, the Tax Status Certificate from the beneficial owner(s) may be provided by the Foreign Lender on behalf of the beneficial owner(s)); or  

(v)    any other form prescribed by applicable laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable    

Requirements of Laws to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.10(f), no Lender shall be required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 3.10(f) that it is not legally eligible to provide. 

(g)    FATCA  .  If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law and otherwise at such times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to avoid the imposition of withholding obligations under FATCA with respect to such Lender.  

(h)    If any Agent or Lender determines, in its good faith discretion, that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied as an offset against other Taxes due) of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by any Loan Party under this   Section 3.10   with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or Lender (including any Taxes), as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);   provided   that the Borrower, upon the request of such Agent or Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority (other than any penalties arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or the Lender)) to such Agent or Lender in the event such Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower s reasonable request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant taxing authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any Agent or Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  

(i)    The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  

3.11    Indemnity  .  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any    

prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Rate Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of, or a conversion from, LIBOR Rate Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (d) any other default by the Borrower in the repayment of such LIBOR Rate Loans when and as required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

3.12    Change of Lending Office  .  Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.9 or 3.10(a), (b) or (c) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Term Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;   provided  , that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage or any unreimbursed costs or expenses; and   provided  , further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.9 or 3.10(a), (b) or (c).

(d)    The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower evidencing any Term Loans, of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit E, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Agent under this Section 9.12.  The agreements in this Section 9.12 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Term Loans and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.  Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender.  

9.13    Administrative Agent May File Proof of Claims  .

(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the compensation,    

expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

(c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.6 to the contrary, a Lender may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund of such Lender without (a) providing any notice (including, without limitation, any administrative questionnaire) to the Administrative Agent or any other Person or (b) delivering an executed Assignment and Assumption to the Administrative Agent;   provided   that (A) such assigning Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, (B) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such assigning Lender in connection with such assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement until an Assignment    

and Assumption and an administrative questionnaire have been delivered to the Administrative Agent, (C) the failure of such assigning Lender to deliver an Assignment and Assumption or administrative questionnaire to the Administrative Agent or any other Person shall not affect the legality, validity or binding effect of such assignment and (D) an Assignment and Assumption between an assigning Lender and its Affiliate or Approved Fund shall be effective as of the date specified in such Assignment and Assumption.  

(d)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of and interest owing with respect to the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  Subject to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph (d), the entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  In the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund pursuant to paragraph (c), as to which an Assignment and Assumption and an administrative questionnaire are not delivered to the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register (a    Related Party Register   ) comparable to the Register on behalf of the Borrower.  The Register or Related Party Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at the Administrative Agent s office at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) above, upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee s completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) above, no assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless and until it has been recorded in the Register (or, in the case of an assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the applicable Related Party Register) as provided in this paragraph (d).  The date of such recordation of a transfer shall be referred to herein as the    Assignment Effective Date  .   

(e)    Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Term Loans owing to it);   provided   that (A) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (D) no participation shall be permitted to be made to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, nor any officer or director of any such Person.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any    

provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1.  Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to the requirements and obligations of those sections including the documentary requirements in Section 3.10(e)) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender;   provided   such Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non fiduciary agent of the Borrower and solely for tax purposes, maintain a register complying with the requirements of Section 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder relating to the exemption from withholding for portfolio interest on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Term Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the  Participant Register );   provided  , that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that the relevant parties, acting reasonably and in good faith, determine that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  Unless otherwise required by the IRS, any disclosure required by the foregoing sentence shall be made by the relevant Lender directly and solely to the IRS.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  

(f)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant had no such participation been transferred to such Participant, unless the entitlement to a greater payment results from a change in any Requirement of Law after the date such Participant became a Participant.  

(g)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest or to any such sale or securitization;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  

(h)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender may not assign or sell participations in, its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a Disqualified Institution;    

provided however, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation for any breach or other violation of this provision by any Lender, any assignee, any participant or any other Person, (ii) no Agent shall have any duty to take any action or to exercise any powers (discretionary or non-discretionary) in connection with any participation having been made to any Disqualified Institution and (iii) no Agent shall have any duty to disclose the fact that a participation has been made to a Disqualified Institution.  

10.7    Sharing of Payments; Set-off  .  

(a)    Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if any Lender (a    Benefited Lender   ) shall, at any time after the Term Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall become due and payable pursuant to Section 8, receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders;   provided  , however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a director creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation to the extent provided in clause (b) of this Section 10.7.  

(b)    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, subject to Section 9.11, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default which is continuing, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower, as the case may be.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender;   provided   that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.          Notwithstanding the foregoing,     no amount set off from     any Loan Party (other     than the Borrower) shall     be applied to any Excluded     Swap Obligations of such Loan     Party (other than the Borrower).    

(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of this Section 10.7 shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require or permit differing payments to be made to Non Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.  

10.8    Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission or electronic mail (in  .pdf  or similar format) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.  

10.9    Severability  .  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  

10.10    Integration  .  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of Holdings, the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF ANY LAW OTHER THAN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
