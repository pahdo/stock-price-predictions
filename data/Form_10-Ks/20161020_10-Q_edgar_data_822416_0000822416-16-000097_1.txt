  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

1. Basis of presentation 
    
  PulteGroup, Inc. is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States ("U.S."), and our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  PHM . Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "PulteGroup", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" used herein refer to PulteGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries. While our subsidiaries engage primarily in the homebuilding business, we also have mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC ( Pulte Mortgage ), and title operations.  
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Business acquisition 
    
  We acquired substantially all of the assets of JW Homes ("Wieland") in January 2016, for $  430.5 million   in cash and the assumption of certain payables related to such assets. The acquired net assets were located in Atlanta, Charleston, Charlotte, Nashville, and Raleigh, and included approximately   7,000   lots, including   375   homes in inventory, and control of approximately   1,300   lots through land option contracts. We also assumed a sales order backlog of   317   homes. The acquired net assets were recorded at their estimated fair values and resulted in goodwill of   $40.4 million   and separately identifiable intangible assets of   $18.0 million   comprised of the John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods tradename, which is being amortized over a   20  -year life. The acquisition of these assets was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. 
    
  Use of estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, including the adoption in January 2016 of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest,  which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet from an asset to a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of applicable unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to senior notes and term loan. See    Note 4   . 
    
  Subsequent events 
    
  We evaluated subsequent events up until the time the financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC").

Other expense (income), net 
    
  Other expense (income), net consists of the following ($000 s omitted):    

(a) 
    Lease exit and related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulted from actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from Michigan to Georgia, which began in 2013. 
              (b)  
    Miscellaneous, net includes a charge of   $15.0 million   related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see    Note 8   ). 
       
  Earnings per share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders (the  Numerator ) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for unvested shares (the  Denominator ) for the period. Computing diluted earnings per share is similar to computing basic earnings per share, except that the Denominator is increased to include the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted shares, unvested restricted share units, and other potentially dilutive instruments. Any stock options that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are considered to be anti-dilutive and are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Our diluted earnings per share calculation excluded   2.3 million   potentially dilutive instruments, including stock options, unvested restricted shares, and unvested restricted share units, for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   4.2 million   and   4.4 million   potentially dilutive instruments, including stock options, unvested restricted shares, and unvested restricted share units, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.     
    
  In accordance with ASC 260 "Earnings Per Share", the two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to an earnings allocation formula that adjusts the Numerator for dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our outstanding restricted share awards, restricted share units, and deferred shares are considered participating securities. The following table presents the earnings per common share (000's omitted, except per share data):

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale 
    
  Substantially all of the loans originated by us are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time after origination, generally within   30 days  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , residential mortgage loans available-for-sale had an aggregate fair value of   $349.0 million   and   $442.7 million  , respectively, and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $335.4 million   and   $429.6 million  , respectively. The net gain (loss) resulting from changes in fair value of these loans totaled   $(1.0) million   and   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These changes in fair value were substantially offset by changes in fair value of corresponding hedging instruments. Net gains from the sale of mortgages were   $30.1 million   and   $23.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $77.4 million   and   $57.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and have been included in Financial Services revenues. 
    
  Derivative instruments and hedging activities 
    
  We are party to interest rate lock commitments ("IRLCs") with customers resulting from our mortgage origination operations. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had aggregate IRLCs of   $319.4 million   and   $208.2 million  , respectively, which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment.  
    
  We hedge our exposure to interest rate market risk relating to residential mortgage loans available-for-sale and IRLCs using forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities, which are commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price, and whole loan commitments, which are obligations of the investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period. Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant derivative financial instruments we use to minimize market risk during the period from the time we execute an interest rate lock until the time the loan is sold to an investor. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had unexpired forward contracts of   $539.0 million   and   $525.0 million  , respectively, and whole loan investor commitments of   $92.5 million   and   $77.6 million  , respectively. Changes in the fair value of IRLCs and other derivative financial instruments are recognized in Financial Services revenues, and the fair values are reflected in other assets or other liabilities, as applicable.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

There are no credit-risk-related contingent features within our derivative agreements, and counterparty risk is considered minimal. Gains and losses on interest rate lock commitments and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are substantially offset by corresponding gains or losses on forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities and whole loan commitments. We are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately   60   days. The fair values of derivative instruments and their locations in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are summarized below ($000 s omitted): 

New accounting pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has also issued a number of updates to this standard. The standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for us for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"), which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), which includes multiple amendments intended to simplify aspects of share-based payment accounting. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning after January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Amendments to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, and forfeitures will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Amendments to the presentation of employee taxes on the statement of cash flows will be applied retrospectively, and amendments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement are to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments from an "incurred loss" approach to a new "expected credit loss" methodology and also requires that credit losses from available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance instead of a write-down. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, and requires full retrospective application on adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on our financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-15"), which addresses several specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for us for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires full retrospective application on adoption. We do not expect ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

2. Inventory 
    
  Major components of inventory were as follows ($000 s omitted):    

We capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities. In all periods presented, we capitalized all Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels. Information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000 s omitted): 

Land option agreements 
    
  We enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Such contracts enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option, which reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs (such as environmental testing, surveys, engineering, and entitlement costs) are capitalized if the costs are directly identifiable with the land under option, the costs would be capitalized if we owned the land, and acquisition of the property is probable. Such costs are reflected in other assets and are reclassified to inventory upon taking title to the land. We write off deposits and pre-acquisition costs when it becomes probable that we will not go forward with the project or recover the capitalized costs. Such decisions take into consideration changes in local market conditions, the timing of required land purchases, the availability and best use of necessary incremental capital, and other factors. We record any such write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs within other expense, net.  
    
  If an entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity ("VIE"), our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. No VIEs required consolidation at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   because we determined that we were not the VIE's primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs is generally limited to our deposits and pre-acquisition costs under the land option agreements.

3.  Segment information 
    
  Our Homebuilding operations are engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the U.S. and the construction of housing on such land. For reporting purposes, our Homebuilding operations are aggregated into   six   reportable segments:

    Not redeemable prior to maturity; guaranteed on a senior basis by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
              (c) 
    The carrying value of senior notes reflects the impact of premiums, discounts, and issuance costs that are amortized to interest cost over the respective terms of the senior notes. As discussed in    Note 1   , we adopted ASU 2015-03 in January 2016. We applied the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation. As a result,   $10.3 million   of debt issuance costs at   December 31, 2015  , were reclassified from other assets to a reduction in senior notes.  
       
  In   February 2016  , we issued   $1.0 billion   of senior unsecured notes, consisting of   $300 million   of   4.25%   senior notes due   March 1, 2021  , and   $700 million   of   5.50%   senior notes due   March 1, 2026  . The net proceeds from this senior notes issuance were used to fund the retirement of   $465.2 million   of our senior notes that matured in May 2016, with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In   July 2016  , we issued an additional   $1.0 billion   of senior unsecured notes, consisting of an additional   $400 million   of the   4.25%   senior notes due   March 1, 2021  , and   $600 million   of   5.00%   senior notes due   January 15, 2027  . The net proceeds from the July senior notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to pay down approximately   $500.0 million   of outstanding debt, including the remainder of the previously existing term loan facility, which resulted in a write-off of   $0.7 million   of remaining debt issuance costs. The senior notes issued in 2016 are unsecured obligations, and rank equally in right of payment with the existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and each of the guarantors, respectively. The notes are redeemable at our option at any time up to the date of maturity.  
    
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  In June 2016, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) that provided for an increase in our maximum borrowings from   $500.0 million   to   $750.0 million   and extended the maturity date from July 2017 to June 2019.  The Revolving Credit Facility contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility to   $1.25 billion  , subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.  The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility with a sublimit of   $375.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be based on either the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or a base rate plus an applicable margin, as defined.  We had   no   borrowings outstanding and   $245.7 million   and   $191.3 million   of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, and a maximum Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio (as each term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility). As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants. Outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
    
  Limited recourse notes payable 
    
  Certain of our local homebuilding operations maintain limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties that totaled   $20.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $35.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . These notes have maturities ranging up to   four   years, are collateralized by the land positions to which they relate, have no recourse to any other assets, and are classified within accrued and other liabilities. The stated interest rates on these notes range up to   5.00%  . 
    
  Pulte Mortgage 
    
  Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement (the  Repurchase Agreement ) with third party lenders. In   August 2016  , Pulte Mortgage entered into an amended and restated Repurchase Agreement that extended the effective date to   August 2017  , and adjusted the maximum aggregate commitment amount according to seasonal borrowing capacity needs. The maximum aggregate commitment is   $175.0 million   as of August 15, 2016, and increases to as high as   $300.0 million   during the seasonally high borrowing period from December 27, 2016 through January 12, 2017. At all other times, the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from   $175.0 million   to   $200.0 million  . The purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity. Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity. Pulte Mortgage had   $158.8 million   and   $267.9 million   outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements as of such dates. 

5. Shareholders  equity 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we declared cash dividends totaling   $93.1 million   and repurchased   17.7 million   shares under our repurchase authorization for a total of   $347.7 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we declared cash dividends totaling   $86.3 million   and repurchased   21.2 million   shares under our repurchase authorization for a total of   $433.7 million  . In July 2016, our Board of Directors approved a   $1.0 billion   increase in our share repurchase authorization. At   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining authorization to repurchase   $1.3 billion   of common shares.  
    
  Under our share-based compensation plans, we accept shares as payment under certain conditions related to stock option exercises and vesting of shares, generally related to the payment of minimum tax obligations. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , participants surrendered shares valued at   $3.2 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively, under these plans. Such share transactions are excluded from the above noted share repurchase authorization. 

6. Income taxes 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   39.5%   and   36.6%  , respectively, compared to   39.9%   for the same periods in 2015. Our effective tax rate for the current year differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes on current year earnings, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, and adjustments to deferred tax assets due to changes in state tax laws. For the prior year, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and adjustments to deferred taxes due to changes in state tax laws and business operations.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance, of   $1.2 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of  
  
    17 

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time.   
    
  Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had   $22.1 million   and   $39.0 million  , respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits and   $12.1 million   and   $17.2 million  , respectively, of related accrued interest and penalties. It is reasonably possible within the next twelve months that our gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to   $18.0 million  , excluding interest and penalties, primarily due to expirations of certain statutes of limitations and potential settlements. 
    
  We are currently under examination by the IRS and various state taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing certain examinations within the next twelve months. The final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statutes of limitation for our major tax jurisdictions generally remain open for examination for tax years   2005   to   2016  . 

7. Fair value disclosures 
    
  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows:    
                   Level 1 
      
    Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 
      
    Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, generally either quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active. 

Level 3 
      
    Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. 

Our assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are summarized below ($000 s omitted):    

Fair values for agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments. Fair values for non-agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based on purchase commitments from whole loan investors and other relevant market information available to management. Fair  
  
    18 

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

values for interest rate lock commitments, including the value of servicing rights, are based on market prices for similar instruments. Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are valued based on market prices for similar instruments. Fair values for whole loan commitments are based on market prices for similar instruments from the specific whole loan investor. 
    
  Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The non-recurring fair values included in the above table represent only those assets whose carrying values were adjusted to fair value as of the respective balance sheet dates. 
    
  The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, Financial Services debt, the Term Loan, and the Revolving Credit Facility approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature and floating interest rate terms. The fair values of senior notes are based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar issues. The carrying value of senior notes was   $3.1 billion   and   $1.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

8. Commitments and contingencies 
    
  Loan origination liabilities 
    
  Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. Determining the liabilities for anticipated losses requires a significant level of management judgment. Given the nature of these claims and the uncertainty regarding their ultimate resolution, actual costs could differ from our current estimates. Changes in these liabilities were as follows ($000's omitted): 

Letters of credit and surety bonds 
    
  In the normal course of business, we post letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performance-related obligations, as security for certain land option agreements, and under various insurance programs. The majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure. We had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling   $245.7 million   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016   and   $191.3 million   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . In the event any such letter of credit or surety bond is drawn, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or surety bond. We do not believe that a material amount, if any, of the letters of credit or surety bonds will be drawn. Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather we are released from the surety bonds as the underlying contractual performance is completed. Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to projects that have not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed. 
    
  Litigation and regulatory matters 
    
  We are involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of our business operations, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, mortgage lending  
  
    19 

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

operations, employment practices, and protection of the environment. As a result, we are subject to periodic examination or inquiry by various governmental agencies that administer these laws and regulations. 
    
  We establish liabilities for legal claims and regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable. We accrue for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates as the matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds the estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we settled a contract dispute related to a land transaction that we terminated approximately ten years ago in response to a collapse in housing demand. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a charge of   $15.0 million  , which is reflected in other expense, net. 
    
  In September 2012, Applecross Club Operations ("Applecross") filed a complaint for breach of contract and promissory estoppel in Applecross v. Pulte Homes of PA, et al. The complaint alleged that we induced Applecross to purchase a golf course from us in 2010 by promising to build over 1,000 residential units in a planned community located outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In September 2015, the jury in the case found in favor of Applecross and awarded damages in the amount of   $20.0 million  . We believe we have meritorious defenses and have appealed the award. However, in light of the jury s verdict, we recorded a reserve of   $20.0 million   in the three months ended September 30,  2015, which is reflected in other expense, net. 
    
  Allowance for warranties 
    
  Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home s construction and operating systems for periods of up to and in limited instances exceeding   10   years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record liabilities in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty liabilities for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from the current estimates. Changes to warranty liabilities were as follows ($000 s omitted): 

Self-insured risks 
    
  We maintain, and require our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage. We also maintain builders' risk, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims. However, we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits.  
    
  Our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects. While construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances, the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding, plumbing, foundations and other concrete work, windows, roofing, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The  
  
    20 

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited, and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain significant per occurrence and aggregate retention levels. In certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a project-specific insurance program provided by us. Policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent self-insurance of these risks by us. This self-insured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase. General liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex, and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year. Our insurance coverage generally requires a per occurrence deductible up to an overall aggregate retention level. Beginning with the first dollar, amounts paid to satisfy insured claims apply to our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations. Any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels. Our insurance policies, including the captive insurance subsidiaries' reinsurance policies, are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant.  
    
  At any point in time, we are managing over 1,000 individual claims related to general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. We reserve for costs associated with such claims (including expected claims management expenses) on an undiscounted basis at the time revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims. The actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses, including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ("IBNR"). IBNR represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims. 
    
  Our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled   $702.5 million   and   $692.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, the vast majority of which relates to general liability claims. The recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both (i) existing claims and related claim expenses and (ii) IBNR and related claim expenses. Liabilities related to IBNR and related claim expenses represented approximately   64%   and   65%   of the total general liability reserves at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The actuarial analyses that determine the IBNR portion of reserves consider a variety of factors, including the frequency and severity of losses, which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data. The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses.  
    
  Housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years, and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. Additionally, IBNR estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. State regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years. Changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves. Additionally, the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves. Because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs. Adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a general liability reserve reversal of    $5.7 million   and   $32.6 million  , respectively, resulting from a legal settlement relating to plumbing claims initially reported to us in 2008 and for which our recorded liabilities were adjusted over time based on changes in facts and circumstances. These claims ultimately resulted in a class action lawsuit involving a national vendor and numerous other homebuilders, homebuyers, and insurance companies. In   2015  , a global settlement was reached, pursuant to which we funded our agreed upon share of settlement costs, which were significantly lower than our previously estimated exposure.  
    
  Costs associated with our insurance programs are classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Changes in these liabilities were as follows ($000's omitted):  
  
    21 

PULTEGROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties. Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. Such receivables are recorded in other assets and totaled   $136.9 million   and   $130.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The insurance receivables relate to costs incurred to perform corrective repairs, settle claims with customers, and other costs related to the continued progression of construction defect claims that we believe are insured. Given the complexity inherent with resolving construction defect claims in the homebuilding industry as described above, there generally exists a significant lag between our payment of claims and our reimbursements from applicable insurance carriers. In addition, disputes between homebuilders and carriers over coverage positions relating to construction defect claims are common. Resolution of claims with carriers involves the exchange of significant amounts of information and frequently involves legal action. Currently, we are the plaintiff in litigation with certain of our insurance carriers in regard to   $108.1 million   of recorded insurance receivables relating to the applicability of coverage to such costs under their policies. 
    
  We believe collection of these insurance receivables, including those in litigation, is probable based on the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel, favorable legal rulings received to date, the high credit ratings of our carriers, and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims, including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

9. Supplemental Guarantor information 
    
  All of our senior notes are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by certain of our wholly-owned Homebuilding subsidiaries and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Guarantors ). Such guaranties are full and unconditional. Our subsidiaries comprising the Financial Services segment along with certain other subsidiaries (collectively, the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") do not guarantee the senior notes. In accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, supplemental consolidating financial information of the Company, including such information for the Guarantors, is presented below. Investments in subsidiaries are presented using the equity method of accounting.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Overview 
    
  Improving demand conditions in the overall U.S. housing market generally continued through September 2016, though industry-wide new home sales continue to pace below historical averages. We remain pleased with the overall demand for new homes, which continues along a sustained path of recovery supported by ongoing job creation, low unemployment, a supportive interest rate environment, and a limited supply of new homes. Within this environment, we remain focused on driving additional gains in construction and asset efficiency to deliver higher returns on invested capital. Consistent with our positive market view and long-term business strategy, we expect to use our capital to support future growth while consistently returning funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
    
  We have looked toward 2016 as a year where we would begin adding volume growth to the efficiency gains we have achieved in recent years. Our prior investments are allowing us to grow the business, as evidenced by net new order dollars increasing   23%   year to date, as compared to the prior year, and our backlog increasing by   20%   to   $3.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . We are achieving this growth while also maintaining our focus on gross margin performance through community location, strategic pricing, and construction efficiencies.  
    
  Our new community openings continue at an elevated level in   2016  . While we have experience opening new communities, starting up new communities can present a challenge in today's environment where entitlement and land development delays are common. We have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of land supply, including the use of land option agreements when possible. We have also focused our land investments on closer-in locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates. We have accepted the trade-off of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in the future performance. 
    
  The following is a summary of our operating results by line of business ($000's omitted, except per share data): 

Homebuilding income before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased compared with the prior year period as the result of higher revenues stemming from increased volume and a higher average selling price. The revenue increase was partially offset by lower gross margins and higher overhead costs, both of which were partially attributable to the assets acquired from Wieland in January 2016 (see    Note 1   ). Income before income taxes also reflects: a charge of   $15.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the same periods in 2015 (see    Note 8   );  a reserve reversal resulting from a favorable legal settlement of   $32.6 million   for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2015 (see    Note 8   ); and severance, lease exit, and related costs of $12.2 million and $19.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
                
    Financial Services income before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased compared with the prior year periods due to an increase in origination volume resulting from higher volumes in the Homebuilding segment combined with higher revenues per loan, which were largely attributable to a higher average loan size combined with favorable market conditions.

Homebuilding Operations 
    
  The following presents selected financial information for our Homebuilding operations ($000 s omitted): 

(a) 
    Includes the amortization of capitalized interest. 
              (b) 
    Includes a reserve reversal of   $5.7 million   and   $32.6 million   resulting from a favorable legal settlement for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively (see    Note 8   ). Also includes severance costs of $7.6 million and $9.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
              (c) 
    Includes a charge of   $15.0 million   related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see    Note 8   ). Also includes lease exit and related costs of $4.6 million and $10.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively (see    Note 1   ). 
              (d) 
    Net new orders excludes backlog acquired from Wieland in January 2016 (see    Note 1   ). Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders.

Home sale revenues 
    
  Home sale revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were higher than the prior year periods by   $417.6 million   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   29%     increase   was attributable to an   11%     increase   in average selling price and a   16%     increase   in closings. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   32%   increase was attributable to a   10%   increase in average selling price and a   20%   increase in closings. Such increases reflect the communities acquired from Wieland during the period. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , such communities contributed   6%   to the growth in revenue,   4%   to the growth in closings and   1%   to the increase in average selling price. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the communities acquired from Wieland contributed   5%   to the growth in revenue,   4%   to the growth in closings and   1%   to the increase in average selling price. Excluding the communities acquired from Wieland, the   increase   in closings reflects the significant investments we are making in opening new communities combined with improved demand. The higher average selling price for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflects an ongoing shift toward move-up buyers, the inclusion of higher-priced homes offered in Wieland communities, and generally stable market conditions. 
       
  Home sale gross margins  
    
  Home sale gross margins were   21.1%   and   21.4%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   23.6%   and   23.2%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The assets acquired from Wieland contributed 70 basis points to this decrease for both periods, primarily as the result of required fair value adjustments associated with the acquired homes in production and related lots. Gross margins remain strong relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors, including shifts in community mix, relatively stable pricing conditions, and lower amortized interest costs (  1.7%   and   1.8%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   2.5%   and   2.7%   for the same periods in 2015), offset by higher house construction and land costs. The lower amortized interest costs resulted from the reduction in our outstanding debt in recent years. We anticipate that our amortized interest costs as a percentage of revenues will remain below 2015 levels for the remainder of 2016, even after consideration of the senior notes issuances completed in February and July 2016 (see    Note 4   ). 
    
  Land sales 
    
  We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development. Land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods, depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions. Land sales had margin contributions of   $1.7 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $0.3 million   and   $5.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  SG A 
    
  SG A as a percentage of home sale revenues was   9.7%   and   11.3%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   10.9%   and   11.9%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The gross dollar amount of our SG A   increased     $23.6 million  , or   15%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   September 30, 2015  , and   $115.6 million  , or   25.6%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , benefited from a reserve reversal of   $5.7 million   and   $32.6 million  , respectively, resulting from a favorable legal settlement (see    Note 8   ). Additionally, SG A reflects severance costs of $7.6 million and $9.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, associated with actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from Michigan to Georgia, which began in 2013. Excluding these items, the increase in gross dollar SG A reflects the addition of field resources and other variable costs related to increased production volumes combined with higher costs related to healthcare and professional fees. Additionally, SG A for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflects the impact of transaction and integration costs associated with the assets acquired from Wieland in January 2016.  
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities was   $0.5 million   and   $4.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $2.2 million   and   $4.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures. As a result, the timing of income and losses varies between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity. 
  
    33 

Other expense, net 
    
  Other expense, net includes the following ($000 s omitted): 

Lease exit and related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulted from actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from Michigan to Georgia, which began in 2013. The increase in write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related primarily to one project in California that we elected to not complete. Miscellaneous, net includes a charge of   $15.0 million   related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see    Note 8   ). 
    
  Net new orders 
    
  Net new order units   increased     17%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the communities acquired from Wieland contributed to this growth in units by   5%  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net new order units increased by   12%  . Wieland's contribution to this growth was   3%  .  Excluding the Wieland assets, our growth in net new order units resulted from the higher number of active communities combined with a small improvement in sales pace per community. Net new orders in dollars increased by   25%   and   23%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price. The cancellation rate (canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period) was   16%   and   14%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   17%   and   13%   for the same periods in 2015. Ending backlog units and dollars, which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed,   increased     8%   and   20%  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016   compared with   September 30, 2015  , as a result of the higher net new order volume. The growth in backlog dollars was also impacted by the higher average selling price.  
    
  Homes in production 
    
  The following is a summary of our homes in production at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

34 

The number of homes in production at   September 30, 2016   was   17%   higher than at   September 30, 2015   due to a number of factors, including the higher net new order volume and backlog and a decision to purposefully increase the number of unsold homes under construction ("spec homes"). The increase in spec homes reflects our intention to achieve a more even production cycle over the course of 2016 compared with 2015. Though inventory levels will fluctuate throughout the year, we expect our overall level of spec home starts to moderate over the year. As part of our inventory management strategies, we will continue to maintain reasonable inventory levels relative to demand in each of our markets. 
    
  Controlled lots 
    
  The following is a summary of our lots under control at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Southeast includes the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Wieland in January 2016 (see    Note 1   ). 
       
  Of our controlled lots,   101,876   and   95,919   were owned and   43,376   and   42,160   were controlled under land option agreements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. While competition for well-positioned land is robust, we continue to pursue strategic land positions that drive appropriate returns on invested capital. The remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled   $2.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . These land option agreements, which generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years, are secured by deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling   $173.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $9.2 million   is refundable.  
    
  Homebuilding Segment Operations

The following tables present selected financial information for our reportable Homebuilding segments: 

(a) 
    Southeast includes the acquisition in January 2016 of substantially all of the assets of Wieland (see    Note 1   ). 
              (b) 
    Northeast includes a charge of   $15.0 million   related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see    Note 8   ). 
              (c) 
    Other homebuilding includes the amortization of intangible assets, amortization of capitalized interest, and other items not allocated to the operating segments. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , Other homebuilding also includes a reserve reversal of   $5.7 million   and   $32.6 million  , respectively resulting from a favorable legal settlement.

(a) 
    Southeast includes the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Wieland in January 2016 (see    Note 1   ). 

37 

Northeast 
    
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , Northeast home sale revenues   decreased     14%   compared with the prior year period due to a   21%     decrease   in closings offset by an   8%     increase   in the average selling price. The   increase   in average selling price was mainly in the Northeast Corridor and New England. The   decrease   in closings occurred mainly in the Northeast Corridor and Mid-Atlantic. Net new orders   decreased     6%  , primarily in the Northeast Corridor and Mid-Atlantic. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   Northeast home sale revenues were flat compared with the prior year period due to an   8%     decrease   in closings, offset by an   8%     increase   in the average selling price. The   decrease   in closings was concentrated in the Northeast Corridor and New England, and the   increase   in average selling price occurred across all markets. The   decreased   income before income taxes resulted from lower margins in the Mid-Atlantic and New England and increased overhead experienced in all markets. Net new orders   decreased     14%   due to reduced order levels in the Northeast Corridor and Mid-Atlantic. 
    
  Northeast income before income taxes also includes a charge of   $15.0 million   related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a charge of   $20.0 million   resulting from the Applecross matter for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   (see    Note 8   ). 
    
  Southeast 
    
  In 2016, the Southeast was significantly impacted by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Wieland in January 2016 (see    Note 1   ). For the   third   quarter of   2016  , Southeast home sale revenues   increased     32%   compared with the prior year period due to a   21%     increase   in the average selling price combined with a   10%     increase   in closings. The   increase   in average selling price and the   increase   in closing volumes occurred across all markets, and are largely due to contributions from the assets acquired from Wieland. Income before income taxes   decreased   due to lower margins in Georgia and Charlotte and increased overhead experienced by all markets. Net new orders   increased     20%   primarily due to higher order levels in Raleigh and Georgia. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,  Southeast home sale revenues   increased     48%   compared with the prior year as the result of an   increase   in closings and average selling prices of   24%   and   19%  , respectively. These increases are largely due to contributions from the assets acquired from Wieland. Excluding those closings, revenues still increased significantly compared with the prior year. Income before income taxes   decreased     12%   as result of transaction and integration costs associated with the assets acquired from Wieland . Net new orders   increased     9%  , primarily due to the assets acquired from Wieland. 
    
  Florida 
    
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , Florida home sale revenues   increased     24%   compared with the prior year period due to a   17%     increase   in closings combined with a   6%     increase   in the average selling price. The increase in closings occurred mainly in North Florida, and the increase in average selling price occurred in both North and Southwest Florida. Income before income taxes   decreased   primarily due to the higher overheads. Net new orders   increased     25%  , reflecting improved order levels across all markets. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Florida home sale revenues   increased     30%   compared with the prior year period due to a   6%     increase   in the average selling price combined with a   23%     increase   in closings. Income before income taxes   increased   primarily due to the higher revenues. Net new orders   increased     17%   due largely to a greater number of active communities in North Florida. 
    
  Midwest 
    
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , Midwest home sale revenues   increased     34%   compared with the prior year period due to an   8%     increase   in average selling price combined with a   24%     increase   in closings. The higher revenues occurred across all markets. The   increased   revenues led to an   increase   in income before income taxes. Net new orders   increased   across all markets. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Midwest home sale revenues   increased     24%   compared with the prior year period due to an   8%     increase   in average selling price combined with a   15%     increase   in closings.

    38 

Texas 
    
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , Texas home sale revenues   increased     29%   compared with the prior year period due to a   15%     increase   in closings combined with a   12%     increase   in the average selling price. The   increase   in average selling price and the   increase   in closings were broad-based across all markets. The   increased   revenues and   increased   closings led to an   increase   in income before income taxes. Net new orders   increased   overall by   22%  , primarily in Dallas and evenly across the remaining markets. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Texas home sale revenues   increased     29%   compared with the prior year period due to a   14%     increase   in closings combined with a   13%     increase   in the average selling price. The   increase   in average selling price was broad-based across all markets, while the   increase   in closings occurred across all markets with the exception of San Antonio. The higher revenues and higher closings led to an   increase   in income before income taxes. Net new orders   increased     7%  , with an increase in Dallas, Houston and Central Texas offset by lower orders in San Antonio. 
    
  West 
    
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , West home sale revenues   increased     51%   compared with the prior year period due to a   31%     increase   in closings combined with a   15%     increase   in average selling price. The   increased   closings and higher average selling price occurred across all markets, except Southern California, which had a slight mix shift. Income before income taxes   increased   due to higher revenues offset by lower gross margins. Net new orders showed a slight increase of   3%  , primarily in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California offset by a decrease in Northern California. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , West home sale revenues   increased     48%   compared with the prior year period due to a   37%     increase   in closings combined with an   8%     increase   in average selling price. The   increased   closings and higher average selling price were broad-based, with the exception of a slight decrease in the Pacific Northwest. Income before income taxes   increased   as a result of higher revenues offset by lower gross margins. Net new orders   increased     16%   and occurred across all markets.

Financial Services Operations 
    
  We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds, including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties. Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days. We also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time. Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our Homebuilding operations, the business levels of our Financial Services operations are highly correlated to Homebuilding. Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production. We believe that our capture rate, which represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash closings, is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model. The following tables present selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000's omitted):     

40 

Revenues 
    
  Total Financial Services revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     23%   and   30%  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015. These changes were primarily related to higher loan origination volume resulting from higher volumes in the Homebuilding segment combined with higher revenues per loan, which were largely attributable to a higher average loan size combined with favorable market conditions. 
    
  Income before income taxes 
    
  Income before income taxes for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     48%   and   64%  , respectively, when compared to the prior year periods. This increase resulted primarily from the   increase   in revenues combined with better overhead leverage. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   39.5%   and   36.6%  , respectively, compared to   39.9%   for the same periods in 2015. Our effective tax rate for the current year differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes on current year earnings, the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters, and adjustments to deferred tax assets due to changes in state tax laws. For the prior year, our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and adjustments to deferred taxes due to changes in state tax laws and business operations.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We finance our land acquisition, development, and construction activities and financial services operations using internally-generated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources, including revolving bank credit and securities offerings, and may determine that modifications to our financing are appropriate. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of   $434.2 million   and    $504.3 million   available under our revolving credit facility. We also had restricted cash balances of   $27.0 million  . We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short-term deposits and investments. We monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss. However, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur. 
    
  Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our Financial Services debt, was   40.0%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Senior unsecured notes 
    
  In   February 2016  , we issued   $1.0 billion   of senior unsecured notes, consisting of   $300 million   of   4.25%   senior notes due   March 1, 2021  , and   $700 million   of   5.50%   senior notes due   March 1, 2026  . The net proceeds from this senior notes issuance were used to fund the retirement of   $465.2 million   of our senior notes that matured in May 2016, with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes. In   July 2016  , we issued an additional   $1.0 billion   of senior unsecured notes, consisting of an additional   $400 million   of the   4.25%   senior notes due   March 1, 2021  , and   $600 million   of   5.00%   senior notes due   January 15, 2027  . The net proceeds from the July senior notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to pay down approximately $500.0 million of outstanding debt, including the remainder of the previously existing term loan facility. The senior notes issued in 2016 are unsecured obligations, and rank equally in right of payment with the existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and each of the guarantors, respectively. The notes are redeemable at our option at any time up to the date of maturity.  
    
  Revolving credit facility 
    
  In June 2016, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) that provided for an increase in our maximum borrowings from   $500.0 million   to   $750.0 million   and extended the maturity date from July 2017 to June 2019. The Revolving Credit Facility contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility to   $1.25 billion  , subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available  
  
    41 

borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility with a sublimit of   $375.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be based on either the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or a base rate plus an applicable margin, as defined.  We had   no   borrowings outstanding and   $245.7 million   and   $191.3 million   of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum Tangible Net Worth, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, and a maximum Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio (as each term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility). As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants. Outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
    
  Limited recourse notes payable 
    
  Certain of our local homebuilding operations maintain limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties that totaled   $20.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $35.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . These notes have maturities ranging up to   four   years, are collateralized by the applicable land positions to which they relate, have no recourse to any other assets, and are classified within accrued and other liabilities. The stated interest rates on these notes range up to   5.00%  . 
    
  Pulte Mortgage 
    
  Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement (the  Repurchase Agreement ) with third party lenders. In   August 2016  , Pulte Mortgage entered into an amended and restated Repurchase Agreement that extended the effective date to   August 2017  , and adjusted the maximum aggregate commitment amount according to seasonal borrowing capacity needs. The maximum aggregate commitment is $175.0 million as of August 15, 2016, and increases to as high as   $300.0 million   during the seasonally high borrowing period from December 27, 2016 through January 12, 2017. At all other times, the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from   $175.0 million   to   $200.0 million  . The purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity. Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity. Pulte Mortgage had   $158.8 million   and   $267.9 million   outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements as of such dates. 
    
  Dividends and share repurchase program 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we declared cash dividends totaling   $93.1 million   and repurchased   17.7 million   shares under our repurchase authorization for a total of   $347.7 million  . Such repurchases are reflected as reductions of common stock and retained earnings.  In July 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. At   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining authorization to repurchase   $1.3 billion   of common shares. We currently expect, subject to market conditions, to repurchase $250.0 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1.0 billion of shares in 2017. 
    
  Cash flows 
    
  Operating activities 
    
  Our net cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $312.2 million  , compared with net cash used in operating activities of   $244.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Generally, the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels. The negative cash flow from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of   $1.1 billion   resulting from ongoing land acquisition and development investment to support future growth combined with a seasonal build of house inventory. These uses of cash were partially offset by our pretax income of   $520.1 million   combined with a seasonal reduction of   $92.6 million   in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. 
    
  Our negative cash flow from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of   $835.3 million   resulting from increased land investment, partially offset by our pretax income of   $442.7 million   and a seasonal reduction of   $68.4 million   in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  

42 

Investing activities 
    
  Investing activities are generally not a significant source or use of cash for us. Net cash used by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $469.6 million  , compared with net cash used by investing activities of   $20.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from Wieland (see    Note 1   ). 
    
  Financing activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $461.8 million  , compared with net cash used in financing activities of   $293.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted primarily from the retirement of   $465.2 million   of our senior notes that matured in May 2016, repayment of our previously outstanding term loan, the repurchase of   17.7 million   common shares for   $347.7 million   under our repurchase authorization, payment of   $94.3 million   in cash dividends, and net repayments of   $109.1 million   for borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement related to a seasonal reduction in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  These uses of cash were offset by the proceeds of the February and July senior unsecured notes issuance for   $2.0 billion  .  
    
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulted primarily from the retirement of   $238.5 million   of our senior notes at their scheduled maturity date,   $32.7 million   of net repayments under the Repurchase Agreement, and the repurchase of   21.2 million   common shares for   $433.7 million   under our repurchase authorization. 

Inflation 
    
  We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers. While we attempt to pass on to our customers' increases in our costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit our ability to do so. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, our revenues, gross margins, and net income could be adversely affected. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again, we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings. This seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes. As a result of the seasonality of our operations, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
    
  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
    
  We issued   $1.0 billion   of senior unsecured notes in both February and July 2016. The repayment terms are described in    Note 4   . We also retired   $465.2 million   of our senior notes that matured in May 2016, and repaid the remainder of our previously outstanding term loan in July 2016. We also amended the Revolving Credit Facility, which provided for an increase in our maximum borrowings from   $500.0 million   to   $750.0 million   and extended the maturity date from July 2017 to June 2019, and entered into an amended and restated Repurchase Agreement for Pulte Mortgage that extended the effective date to   August 2017   and adjusted the maximum aggregate commitment amount according to seasonal borrowing capacity needs. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our "Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments" contained in Item 7,   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  s included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual  
  
    43 

extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $245.7 million  . Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to projects that have not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At   September 30, 2016  , these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of   $2.2 billion  . Pursuant to these land option agreements, we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was   $6.5 million  , of which our proportionate share was   $2.1 million  . Of this amount, we provided limited recourse guaranties for less than   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with those contained in Item 7,   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Quantitative disclosure 
  We are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. We utilize both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. For fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity. As a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt. 
  The following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted-average interest rates, and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016   ($000 s omitted): 

(a) Includes the Pulte Mortgage Repurchase Agreement. Does not include our Revolving Credit Facility, under which there were no borrowings outstanding at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Qualitative disclosure 
    
  There have been no material changes to the qualitative disclosure found in Item 7A,   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 31(a)  
  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION  
  I, Ryan R. Marshall, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   of PulteGroup, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
