NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

OVERVIEW   

The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ,  SMC ,  The Singing Machine )
and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada ( Macau Subsidiary ), SMC Logistics,
Inc. ( SMC-L ) and SMC-Music, Inc.( SMC-M ) are primarily engaged in the development, marketing, and sale
of consumer karaoke audio systems, accessories, musical instruments and musical recordings. The products are sold by SMC to retailers
and distributors for resale to consumers.  

NOTE
2-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying
unaudited financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management,
such condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for
the fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position and the condensed consolidated results of operations. The
condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet information as of March 31, 2016 was derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with that report.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
Singing Machine makes estimates and assumptions in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances, warranty
reserves, inventory reserves and reserves for promotional incentives that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty; therefore,
the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Historically, past changes to these estimates have not had a
material impact on the Company s financial condition. However, circumstances could change which may alter future expectations.  

FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION   

The
functional currency of the Macau Subsidiary is the Hong Kong dollar. The financial statements of the subsidiary are translated
to U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for
revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions and translations were not material
during the periods presented.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

At
times, the Company maintains cash in United States bank accounts that are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured amounts. The Company maintains cash balances in foreign financial institutions. The amounts at foreign financial institutions
at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 are $829,698 and $21,256, respectively.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

The
Singing Machine s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business. Accounts
receivable are carried at cost, net of allowances for uncollectible amounts. Provisions for losses are charged to operations in
amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the
Company s accounts receivable.  

COLLECTIBILITY
OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   

The
Singing Machine s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its
customers, current economic conditions and historical information, and, in the opinion of management, is believed to be an amount
sufficient to respond to normal business conditions. Management sets 100% reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves
based upon historical collection experience. Should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations
to the Company, this allowance may need to be significantly increased, which would have a negative impact on operations.  

INVENTORY   

Inventories
are comprised primarily of electronic karaoke equipment, microphones and accessories, and are stated at the lower of cost or market,
as determined using the first in, first out method. The Singing Machine reduces inventory on hand to its net realizable value
on an item-by-item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original
cost. A charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost.
Management regularly reviews the Company s investment ininventories for such declines in value.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS    

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication
that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the related assets are
less than the carrying amount, the carrying amounts are reduced to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360-10-05,
 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT    

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is provided for in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to their estimated useful
lives using accelerated and straight-line methods.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    

We
follow FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosures of information about the fair value of certain financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. For purposes of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial
instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced sale or liquidation.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, obligations to clients for returns and allowances, subordinated debt to Starlight Marketing Development, Ltd. (related
party) and net due to related parties approximates fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.
The carrying amounts on the note payable to Ram Light Management, Ltd. (related party) approximates fair value due the relatively
short period to maturity and related interest accrued at a rate similar to market rates. The carrying amounts on the revolving
line of credit approximates fair value due the relatively short period to maturity and related interest accrued at market rates.  

RECLASSIFICATIONS   

Certain
balances presented relating to accounts receivable related parties - other have been reclassified to conform to the financial
statement presentation adopted for this period.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

Revenue
from the sale of equipment, accessories, musical recordings and subscriptions and third  party logistics services are recognized
upon the later of: (a) the time of shipment or (b) when title passes to the customers and all significant contractual obligations
and services have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Net sales are comprised of
gross sales net of actual and estimated future returns, discounts and volume rebates.  

SHIPPING
AND HANDLING COSTS   

Shipping
and handling costs are classified as a component of selling expenses and those billed to customers are recorded as a reduction
of expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income.  

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION   

The
Company follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 718-20,  Compensation   Stock Compensation Awards Classified as Equity .
ASC 718-20 requires all share-based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options, be measured at fair value
and expensed in the condensed consolidated statements of income over the service period (generally the vesting period). The Company
uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value stock options. Employee stock option compensation expense for the three
and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes the estimated fair value of options granted, amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for the entire portion of the award. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the stock option expense was $17,685 and $2,692, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
stock option expense was $27,014 and $4,693, respectively.  

ADVERTISING   

Costs
incurred for producing and publishing advertising of the Company are charged to operations the first time the advertising takes
place. The Company has entered into cooperative advertising agreements with its major customers that specifically indicated that
the customer has to spend the cooperative advertising fund upon the occurrence of mutually agreed events. The percentage of the
cooperative advertising allowance ranges from 2% to 10% of the purchase. The customers have to advertise the Company s products
in the customer s catalog, local newspaper and other advertising media. The customer must submit the proof of the performance
(such as a copy of the advertising showing the Company s products) to the Company to request for the allowance. The customer
does not have the ability to spend the allowance at their discretion. The Company believes that the identifiable benefit from
the cooperative advertising program and the fair value of the advertising benefit is equal or greater than the cooperative advertising
expense. Advertising expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,561,790 and $1,237,478, respectively.
Advertising expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,766,840 and $1,516,834, respectively. As of September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 there was an accrual for cooperative advertising allowances of $1,000,825 and $93,222, respectively.
These amounts were a component of accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS   

Research
and development costs are charged to results of operations as incurred. These expenses are shown as a component of selling, general
and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, these amounts totaled $23,757 and $69,169, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, these
amounts totaled $69,393 and $101,289, respectively.  

INCOME
TAXES   

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740  Accounting for Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method
of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion
of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.  

The
Company analyzes its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each interim period and, based on management s best
estimate of its full year effective tax rate, recognizes cumulative adjustments to its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The
Company s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 is estimated to be approximately 32%. The effective
tax rate for the full year ended March 31, 2016 was approximately 35%.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, The Singing Machine had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $1.7 million and
$2.4 million respectively. The Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $868,000 and $687,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $699,000 and $375,000
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
Company recognizes a liability for uncertain tax positions. An uncertain tax position is defined as a position in a previously
filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law
and which is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. The Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax
benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
As of September 30, 2016, there were no uncertain tax positions that resulted in any adjustment to the Company s provision
for income taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income
taxes. The Company currently has no liabilities recorded for accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the tax years ended March 31, 2014 through
March 31, 2016.  

COMPUTATION
OF EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Income
per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income per share is presented as the conversion of stock options would have a dilutive effect. As of September 30, 2016 and
2015 total potential dilutive shares amounted to approximately 775,000 and 484,000 shares, respectively. These shares were included
in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
May 2014, the FASB ASC 2014-09 which outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use when accounting for revenue arising
from contracts with customers. The core principle of the revenue recognition model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict
the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In order to achieve this core principle a company must apply the following steps
in determining revenue recognition:  

Identify
    the contract(s) with a customer   

Identify
    the performance obligations in the contract.   

Determine
    the transaction price.   

Allocate
    the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   

Recognize
    revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   

The
amendments in this ASU are now effective for annual reporting periods beginning April 1, 2018 including interim periods within
that reporting period with early application allowed beginning with reporting periods beginning April 1, 2017. Management is currently
assessing whether the implementation of ASU 2014-09 will have any material effect on the company s consolidated financial
statements.

   September

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The ASU requires that inventory be measured
at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course
of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The guidance
in ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after April 1, 2017. The
new guidance should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period.  Management is currently assessing whether the implementation of ASU 2015-11 will have any material effect on the
company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right- of use asset and a lease
liability on its Balance Sheet regardless of whether a lease is identified as financial lease or an operating lease. If the lease
is identified as a financial lease then the lessee must recognize interest on the lease liability separately from amortization
of the right-of-use asset in the statement of income and classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within
financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in
the statement of cash flows. If the lease is identified as and operating lease then the lessee must recognize a single lease cost
in the statement of income, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line
basis and classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Both quantitative and qualitative
disclosures are required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the
amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning April 1,
2019; including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently assessing whether
the implementation of ASU 2016-02 will have any material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

NOTE
3   DUE FROM PNC BANK   

In
connection with the Company s revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, cash collected by PNC Bank on trade accounts receivable
may exceed amounts borrowed on the revolving credit facility from time to time (See Note 7   LINE OF CREDIT). As of September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, PNC Bank owed the Company $0 and $184,392, respectively, which represented cash received by PNC Bank
on accounts receivable in excess of amounts borrowed against the revolving credit facility.

NOTE
6 - OBLIGATIONS TO CUSTOMERS FOR RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES   

Due
to the seasonality of the business and length of time customers are given to return defective product, it is not uncommon for
customers to accumulate credits from the Company s sales and allowance programs that are in excess of unpaid invoices in

As
a condition of the Revolving Credit Facility, a portion of the Company s related-party debt with Ram Light Management, Ltd.
in the amount of $1,100,000 was converted to a note payable with Ram Light Management, Ltd. ( Ram Light Note ). The
Ram Light Note bears interest at 6% per annum with quarterly payments of $150,000 (including principal and interest) payable which
commenced on December 31, 2014. The scheduled principal and interest payments of $150,000 were only permitted upon receipt of
the Company s quarterly compliance certificate; the Company having met the mandatory pay-down of the Revolving Credit Facility
to $1,000,000 and average excess availability for the prior 30 days (after subtraction of third party trade payables 30 days or
more past due) of no less than $1,000,000 after giving effect to the payment. While the Company did meet the mandatory pay-down
requirement, the Company did not meet the prior 30 day average excess availability requirement permitting the Company to make
all scheduled payments on the note, and as a result, the first three scheduled payments due December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015
and June 30, 2015 were not made. As part of the Conditions to Installment Payment in the note, payments not made under this note
that cannot be made as a result of the foregoing prohibition shall not be deemed an Event of Default and will not cumulate with
the next payment that can be made, but rather will be payable on the maturity date together with any additional interest that
has accrued thereon. The Company has made all payments as scheduled since June 30, 2015. In September 2016 the Revolving Credit
Facility was modified which allowed the modification of the Ram Light Note such that the remaining amount due on the note is to
be paid off in increments of $100,000 (inclusive of principal and interest) due at the end of each month which extended the maturity
of the note to March 31, 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense
on the Ram Light Note in the amount of $9,375 and $17,544, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
the Company recognized interest expense on the Ram Light Note in the amount of $20,838 and $34,828, respectively. As of September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 the company accrued interest expense on the Ram Light Note in the amount of $63,778. These amounts

OVERVIEW

The
Singing Machine Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ,  SMC ,  The Singing Machine )
and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries SMC (Comercial Offshore De Macau) Limitada ( Macau Subsidiary ), SMC Logistics,
Inc. ( SMC-L ) and SMC-Music, Inc.( SMC-M ) are primarily engaged in the development, marketing, and sale
of consumer karaoke audio systems, accessories, musical instruments and musical recordings. The products are sold by SMC to retailers
and distributors for resale to consumers.  

Our
products are sold throughout North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa primarily through major mass merchandisers and
warehouse clubs, on-line retailers and to a lesser extent department stores, lifestyle merchants, direct mail catalogs and showrooms,
music and record stores, and specialty stores.  

Representative
customers include Amazon, BJ s Wholesale, Costco, Sam s Club, Target, Toys R Us, and Wal-Mart. Our business has historically
been subject to seasonal fluctuations causing our revenues to vary from quarter to quarter and between the same periods in different
fiscal years. Our products are manufactured for the most part based on the purchase indications of our customers. We are uncertain
of how significantly our business would be harmed by a prolonged economic recession, but we anticipate that continued contraction
of consumer spending would negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

The
following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items related to our condensed consolidated statements of income
as a percentage of net sales for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

QUARTER
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

NET
SALES   

Net
sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased to $28,129,051 from $21,060,584 an increase of approximately $7,068,000
as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015. Part of this increase was due to a shipment made to a major customer
of approximately $3,800,000 for Black Friday promotional goods not included in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. There was
an increase of approximately $1,425,000 in sales to one major customer whose internet sales continues to follow continued growth
in on-line shopping. There was an increase of approximately $474,000 in international sales with continued penetration in the
United Kingdom market. The remaining increase of approximately $1,369,000 is due primarily to accelerated customer purchasing
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the  

quarter
ended September 30, 2015.  

GROSS
PROFIT    

Gross
profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased to $6,502,632 from $4,950,641 an increase of approximately $1,552,000
as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is primarily due to revenue growth.  

Gross
profit margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was 23.1% compared to 23.5% for the three month period ended
September 30, 2015, a decrease of .4%. The mix of products sold including shipments of lower margin promotional products for one
major customer was the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit margin.  

OPERATING
EXPENSES    

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses increased to $3,738,149. This represents an increase of approximately
$667,000 from the same period s quarter ended total operating expenses of $3,070,823. This increase was primarily due to
an increase of approximately $396,000 in variable selling expenses including commissions and co-op advertising programs granted
to major retail customers, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $265,000 with the remaining
variance due to an increase in depreciation expense.  

Selling
expenses increased approximately $396,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30,
2015. Due to the increase in net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 advertising co-op allowance for major retail customers
increased approximately $362,000 accounting for 91% of the increase with the remaining variance of approximately $34,000 due to
variable selling expenses such as freight and commissions which increased commensurate with the increase in net sales.  

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $265,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. There was a $75,000 increase in payroll expenses due to increased sales bonus accruals and new hires.
There was an increase of approximately $48,000 in related party service charges due to increase of services provided by our parent
company. There was an increase in warehouse supplies and seasonal temporary labor associated with the increase in net sales of
approximately $46,000. The remaining increase was primarily due to other variable administrative expenses including an increase
in estimated uncollectible reserves.

FROM OPERATIONS   

Income
from operations increased approximately $885,000 this quarter, to $2,764,483 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to income from operations of $1,879,818 for the same period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in sales and gross profit margin
offset by the increase in operating expenses as explained above for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period ended September 30, 2015 accounted for most of the variance.  

OTHER
EXPENSES    

Other
expenses decreased to $85,558 from $121,326 for the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest
expense of approximately $36,000 as improved cash position allowed the company to borrow less on the Revolving Credit Facility
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  

INCOME
TAXES    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company recognized an income tax provision of approximately
$868,000 and $687,000, respectively, due to management s best estimate of the Company s full year effective tax rate
of approximately 32% and 39%, respectively.  

NET
INCOME   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 net income increased to $1,810,476 compared to net income of $1,071,473 for the same
period a year ago. The increase in net income was the same as explained in income from operations.  

SIX
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

NET
SALES   

Net
sales for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $32,988,443 from $24,527,458, an increase of approximately $8,461,000
as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015. Part of this increase was due to a shipment made to a major customer
of approximately $5,488,000 for Black Friday promotional goods not included during the six months ended September 30, 2015. There
was an increase of approximately $1,459,000 in sales to one major customer whose internet sales continues to follow continued
growth in on-line shopping. There was an increase of approximately $379,000 in international sales with continued penetration
in the United Kingdom market. The remaining increase of approximately $1,135,000 is due primarily to accelerated customer purchasing
during the six months ended September 30, 2016  

compared
to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

GROSS
PROFIT    

Gross
profit for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $7,646,315 from $5,809,062, an increase of approximately $1,837,000
as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is primarily due to revenue growth.  

Gross
profit margin for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was 23.2% compared to 23.7% for the six month period ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of .5%. The mix of products sold including shipments of lower margin promotional products for one major customer
was the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit margin.  

OPERATING
EXPENSES    

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses increased to $5,453,673 from $4,667,864 for the six months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $786,000. This increase was primarily due an increase of approximately $363,000
in variable selling expenses including freight, commissions and co-op advertising programs granted to major retail customers,
and an increase general and administrative of approximately $410,000 with the remaining increase of approximately $13,000 due
to an increase in depreciation expense.  

Selling
expenses increased approximately $363,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended September
30, 2015. Due to the increase in net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 advertising co-op allowance for major retail
customers increased approximately $340,000 accounting for 94% of the increase with the remaining variance of approximately $23,000
due to variable selling expenses such as freight and commissions which increased commensurate with the increase in net sales.  

General
and administrative expenses increased approximately $410,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. There was a $123,000 increase in payroll expenses due to increased sales bonus accruals and new hires.
There was an increase of approximately $118,000 in related party service charges due to increase of services provided by our parent
company. There was an increase in warehouse supplies and seasonal temporary labor associated with the increase in net sales of
approximately $109,000. The remaining increase was primarily due to other variable administrative expenses including an increase
in estimated uncollectible reserves.  

INCOME
FROM OPERATONS   

Income
from operations increased approximately $1,051,000 to income from operations of $2,192,642 for the six months ended September
30, 2015 compared to income from operations of $1,141,198 for the same period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in sales
and gross profit margin was somewhat offset by the increase in operating expenses as explained above for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015 accounted for most of the variance.  

OTHER
EXPENSES    

Our
other expenses decreased to $120,104 from $189,957 for the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in interest expense of approximately $70,000 as improved cash position allowed the company to borrow less on the Revolving Credit
Facility during the six month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the six month period ended September 30, 2015.  

INCOME
TAXES    

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company recognized an income tax provision of approximately
$699,000 and $375,000, respectively, due to management s best estimate of the Company s full year effective tax rate
of approximately 32% and 39%, respectively.  

NET
INCOME    

For
the six months ended September 30, 2016 net income increased to $1,373,403 compared to net income of $576,547 for the same period
a year ago. The increase in net income was the same as explained in income from operations and other expenses.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
of September 30, 2016, Singing Machine had cash on hand of $948,506 as compared to cash on hand of $445,312 on September 30, 2015.
We had working capital of $4,900,751 as of September 30, 2016.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $8,971,706 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8,081,061 used in
operating activities during the same period a year ago. During the six month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company experienced
an increase in inventory of approximately $5,000,000 primarily due to inventory requirements for the upcoming holiday season.
Accounts receivable also increased by approximately $17,000,000 due primarily to seasonal increases in customer shipments during
the second quarter ended September 30, 2016. These uses of operating cash were offset by operating activities that provided cash
including net income of approximately $1,400,000,  

an
increase in accounts payable (primarily inventory vendors) of approximately $9,400,000, an increase in accrued expenses of approximately
$1,300,000 and a seasonal increase in warranty provisions of approximately $600,000 which were all commensurate with the increase
in seasonal sales. These activities accounted for approximately 97% of the cash used in operations with the remaining 3% due to
seasonal changes in other operating assets and liabilities.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $8,081,061 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. During the six month period ending
September 30, 2015 the Company experienced an increase in inventory of approximately $2,200,000 primarily due to inventory requirements
for the upcoming holiday season. Accounts receivable also increased by approximately $15,500,000 due primarily to seasonal increases
in customer shipments during the second quarter ended September 30, 2015. These uses of operating cash were offset by operating
activities that provided cash including net income of approximately $600,000, an increase in accounts payable (primarily inventory
vendors) of approximately $6,500,000, an increase in related party debt (primarily for goods manufactured by related parties)
of approximately $700,000, an increase in accrued expenses of approximately $1,200,000 and a seasonal increase in warranty provisions
of approximately $400,000 which were all commensurate with the increase in seasonal sales. These activities accounted for approximately
97% of the cash used in operations with the remaining 3% due to seasonal changes in other operating assets and liabilities.  

Net
cash used by investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $76,428 as compared to $129,517 used by investing
activities for the same period ended a year ago. The decrease in investment activity was due to decreased investment in tooling
and molds for new products as compared to the same period in the prior year.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $7,880,150 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of $8,539,604 for the same period ended a year ago. During the six month period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company borrowed approximately $8,100,000 from the Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank which provided most of the working
capital for operations during the period. This was offset by principal payments of approximately $200,000 on the Ram Light Management,
Ltd. note payable. During the six month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company borrowed approximately $8,700,000 from the
Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank for working capital. This was offset by the payment of deferred financing costs of approximately
$100,000 on the Ram Light Management, Ltd. note payable.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we continued to borrow from our Revolving Credit Facility, which provides for a maximum loan amount of
$15,000,000 during peak selling season and reduces to $7,500,000 during the off-peak season. We believe this credit facility will
be adequate to maintain and grow our business during the three-year term of the agreement. If we are unable to comply with the
financial covenants defined in the financing agreement and default on the credit facility, it may have a material adverse effect
on our ability to meet our financial obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in July 2017. Management plans to either
extend the current Revolving Credit Facility or negotiate a new credit facility on or before the expiration of the current agreement.
If we are unable to extend or negotiate a new agreement, it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial
obligations.  

INVENTORY
SELL THROUGH    

We
monitor the inventory levels and sell through activity of our major customers to properly anticipate defective returns and maintain
the appropriate level of inventory. We believe that our warranty provision reflects the proper amount of reserves to cover potential
defective sales returns based on historical return ratios and information available from the customers.  

SEASONAL
AND QUARTERLY RESULTS    

Historically,
our operations have been seasonal, with the highest net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters (reflecting increased
orders for equipment and music merchandise during the Christmas holiday season) and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters
of the fiscal year. Sales in our second and third fiscal quarters, combined, accounted for approximately 85% and 87% of net sales
in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Our
results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped
to customers, as well as other factors. The fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on
a quarter-to-quarter basis.  

INFLATION

Inflation
has not had a significant impact on our operations. We generally have adjusted our prices to track changes in the Consumer Price
Index since prices we charge are generally not fixed by long-term contracts.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

The
Company s interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make subjective decisions, assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgement increases such judgements become even more subjective.
While management believes its assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may be materially different than estimated.
The critical accounting estimates and assumptions have not materially changed from those identified in the Company s 2016
Annual Report.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

(a)
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
  Changes in Internal Controls.   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during
the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting.
