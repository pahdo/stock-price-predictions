NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
		  
		   NOTE 1- ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS   
		   Organization and Basis of Presentation:   
		  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Advanced Oxygen Technologies, Inc. ( Group  or the  Company ) have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, they do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 
				 
				The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC.. 
			  
		   Lines of Business:   
		  The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Anton Nielsen Vojens ApS owns income producing commercial real estate leased until 2026. The real estate consists solely of the land with no buildings or improvements ( Land ). All improvements on the Land are those of the tenant.  
		   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   

Revenue recognition of rental income:     
              Revenues are
                recognized during the period in which the rental payment is received. The
                Company applies the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC')
                605-10. Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ASC 605-10, which provides
                guidance on recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenues in financial
                statements filed with the SEC. 
					  
              The Company's source of revenue is from a commercial property lease in which quarterly payments are received pursuant to the property lease which is in effect until 2026. 
				  
		    Return to Table of Contents    
		 
		      Property Plant and
            Equipment:  
			  Land and
                buildings are recognized at cost. Land is carried at cost less accumulated
                impairment losses. 

Impairment of Real Estate Investments:   
							  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable or realized. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of its real estate investments through its undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its real estate investments, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its real estate investments.   

Foreign currency translation:    

Foreign currency transactions are translated applying the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates. Stockholders' equity accounts are translated at the appropriate historical rates and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates for the year. Exchange rate differences that arise between the rate at the transaction date and the one in effect at the payment date, or at the balance sheet date, are recognized in the income statement. 
					 
				   Income Taxes:    
		   The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required when it is less likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets. Because it is doubtful that the net operating losses of recent years will ever be used, a valuation allowance has been recognized equal to the tax benefit of net operating losses generated. 
					 
				   Net Earnings per Share:    
		  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 there were 10,000 and 10,000, respectively potential dilutive shares that need to be considered as Common Share Equivalents.  
		    
				   Cash and Cash Equivalents:    
		   For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
				  The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at September 30, 2016 did not exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such amounts. 
					 
				   Estimates:    
		   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
					 
					         Concentrations of Credit Risk:      
		  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to major credit risk consist principally of a single subsidiary of Anton Nielsen Vojens ApS. 
			  
		      Reclassification:       
		  Certain balances in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation. 
			  
		       Return to Table of Contents       

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:   
		  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either financing or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, however early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.  
		 
             In February 2015, the
            FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02)  Consolidation
            (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  ASU 2015-02 changes the
            analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should
            consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual
            reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
            December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
            period. We do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 will have any
            impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Other recent accounting
            pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to
            have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.  
		       N          OTE 3 - MAJOR CUSTOMER:      
		     The Company's subsidiary, Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS has sales to major customers who were non related parties. For the period ending September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015 the major customer concentrations were as follows:      
		 
		              NOTE 4 - LAND AND BUILDINGS :              
		  The Land owned by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary constitutes the largest asset of the Company. During the 3 month period ending September 30, 2016 the Company recorded an increase in the carrying value of the Land of $14,071 due to the currency translation difference.

		                   ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   
		  The following should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Financial Statements.  
		  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:   
		  Certain statements contained in this report, including statements concerning the Company's future and financing requirements, the Company's ability to obtain market acceptance of its products and the competitive market for sales of small production business' and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements; actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements, which statements involve risks and uncertainties, including without limitation to those risks and uncertainties set forth in any of the Company's Registration Statements under the heading  Risk Factors  or any other such heading. In addition, historical performance of the Company should not be considered as an indicator for future performance, and as such, the future performance of the Company may differ significantly from historical performance.   
		   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO 2015:   
		   Revenues:  Revenues from operations for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $9,149 and $9,041 respectively. They were attributable to operations of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Anton Nielsen Vojens. The fluctuation was due to currency fluctuations.  
           Selling, general and administrative expenses:  G A expenses for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $2,062 and $223 respectively. The expenses are attributable to ANV's operations, the Company's SEC compliance and the new engagement of independent auditors.  
		   Interest expense:  Interest expense for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $1,010 and $2,200 respectively. Interest expenses for 2016 are lower primarily due to the currency fluctuations and the reduction of debt.  
		   Net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders:  Net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders was $1,913 or $0.0008 per share for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to $6,618 or $0.0029 per share for September 30, 2015 and mainly attributable to the Company's engagement of new auditors and currency fluctuations.  
		   Liquidity and capital resources:    At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $45,342 and $46,170 respectively. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $207,851 and $217,887 respectively. The change in cash is primarily associated with currency fluctuations, and the decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily due to payment of debt and normal operations.  
		  Net cash provided from (used for) operating activities for three month period ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $3,423 and $29,096, respectively. The net cash used by operating activities was primarily due to the operations of ANV and the payment of ANV taxes. 
			  
		  Net cash provided from (used for) financing activities for 2016 and 2015 was $(5,377) and $(4,236) respectively. Net cash provided from or used for financing activities for both periods is related to the company's borrowings from banks, officers and directors, and the repayment of debt.  
		   OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS:   
		  We do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements.  
		    Return to Table of Contents    
		 
		    ACQUISITION EFFORTS:   
		  The Company continues its efforts to raise capital to support operations and growth, and is actively searching acquisition or merger with another company that would complement AOXY or increase its earnings potential. During this period, the Company has been in discussion with Companies looking to be acquired. AOXY has not negotiated any terms nor proposed any acquisitions of any of these companies that have been accepted. In addition, the Company is in discussion with potential lending institutions to assist in financing any proposed acquisition. The Company expects difficulty in financing the growth of the increased business or acquisition and has been concentrating on raising capital and/or obtaining a line of credit.

		  Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

		  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as required in applicable SEC rules and forms.     
				     During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting      as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
