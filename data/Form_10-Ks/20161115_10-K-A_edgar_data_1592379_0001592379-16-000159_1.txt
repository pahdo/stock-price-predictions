EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  Papa Murphy s Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10 K (this  Amendment No. 1 ) to amend and restate Part II, Item 9A of its previously filed Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 9, 2016 (the  Original Form 10 K ), in order (i) to include management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which was inadvertently omitted from the Original Form 10 K, and (ii) to correct an inadvertent omission of certain language from paragraph 4 of the certification of its Chief Executive Officer filed as Exhibit 31.1 and the certification of its Chief Financial Officer filed as Exhibit 31.2 to the Original Form 10 K. 
    
  This Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10 K, which continues to speak as of the date of the Original Form 10 K. Other than as specifically set forth herein, this Amendment No. 1 does not modify or update disclosures in the Original Form 10 K. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Form 10 K or modify or update any related or other disclosures. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
               Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
               Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in   Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  . Based on our evaluation under the framework in   Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2015. 
  We have not engaged an independent registered accounting firm to perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of any balance sheet date or for any period reported in our financial statements. Our independent public registered accounting firm will first be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the first year we are no longer an  emerging growth company.  
               Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
