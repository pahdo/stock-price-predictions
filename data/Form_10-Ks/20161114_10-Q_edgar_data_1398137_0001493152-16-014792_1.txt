NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Solis Tek Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company )
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016.  

History
and Organization    

Solis
Tek Inc. (the  Company ) was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 2, 2007 as Cinjet,
Inc. ( Cinjet ). Effective September 1, 2015, Cinjet changed its corporate name to Solis Tek Inc. On June 23, 2015,
the Company entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the  Agreement ) with Solis Tek Inc.,
a California corporation ( STI ), and CJA Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company ( Merger Sub ), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into STI (the  Merger ),
with STI surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Company s
Board of Directors and the sole Director of the Company, effective June 23, 2015. The Merger closed on June 23, 2015.  

At
the effective time of the Merger, each share of STI common stock issued and outstanding was converted automatically into the right
to receive .166 shares of the common stock of the Company, with an aggregate of 26,187,000 shares of the Company s common
stock issued to the former shareholders of STI.  

Upon
the closing of the Merger, STI paid a total of $22,500 to four shareholders of the Company for the cancellation of a total of
61,297,002 shares of the Company s common stock. Also at the closing of the Merger, STI paid $198,100 to the Company to
settle and pay liabilities of $405,932, which represented all of the then current liabilities of the Company. After the closing,
a total of 29,551,998 shares of the Company were outstanding.  

Upon
completion of the Merger, the former stockholders of STI owned approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of the Company s
common stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock prior to the Merger owned the balance.
As the former owners and management of STI have voting and operating control of the Company after the Merger, the transaction
has been accounted for as a recapitalization with the STI deemed the acquiring companies for accounting purposes, and the Company
deemed the legal acquirer. Due to the change in control, the consolidated financial statements reflect the historical results
of STI prior to the Merger, and that of the combined company following the Merger. Common stock and the corresponding capital
amounts of the Company pre-Merger have been retroactively restated as capital stock shares reflecting the exchange ratio in the
Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill has been recorded in this transaction and the cash paid by the Company
of $248,980 (including $28,380 of transaction costs) has been reflected as a cost of the transaction in 2015.  

Overview
of Business    

The
Company is an importer, distributer and marketer of digital lighting equipment for the hydroponics industry. Using certain of
its proprietary technologies, the Company provides innovative aptitudes with its ballast, reflector and lamp products. The Company s
customers include retail stores, distributors and commercial growers in the United States and abroad.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Stock
Split   

On
July 7, 2015, the Company s shareholders authorized its Board of Directors to effectuate a stock split of the Company s
issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 6-for-1 (the  Stock Split ), which was ultimately declared
effective by the Board of Directors as of the close of business on September 1, 2015. As a result of the Stock Split, every one
issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock was changed and converted into six shares of common stock. Share
related information presented in these financial statements and accompanying footnotes has been retroactively adjusted to reflect
the reduced number of shares resulting from this action.  

Income
(Loss) Per Share Calculations   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares available. Shares of restricted stock subject to vesting are included in basic weighted average common shares
outstanding from the time they vest. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share
except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Weighted average number of shares
outstanding has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting acquirer as a result
of the reverse merger as if these shares had been outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the Company s products to its customers, provided that evidence of an arrangement
exists, title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable
is reasonably assured. Title to the Company s products primarily is transferred to the customer once the product is shipped
from the Company s warehouses. In certain cases, the products are shipped directly from the Company s vendors directly
to the Company s customer, in which case title is transferred once the product is received by the customer. Products are
not shipped until there is a written agreement with the customer with a specified payment arrangement. Any discounts that are
offered are done as a reduction of the invoiced amount at the time of billing.  

Payments
received before the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits. There were no customer
deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company does not offer a general right of return on any of its sales and considers all sales as final. The Company generally provides
a three-year warranty on its ballasts. The Company does not maintain a warranty reserve as the Company is able to chargeback its
vendors for all warranty claims. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a reserve for returned product
in the amount of $130,410, which reduced the accounts receivable balances as of those periods.

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates are used in valuing our allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory valuations, among others. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company has determined the estimated useful lives of its property and
equipment, as follows:  

Machinery
    and equipment   
      5
    years   
 
      Computer
    equipment  
      3
    years   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
      7
    years   

Maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of
are removed from the related accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statements of operations.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation
allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded
a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely of
being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that
the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions
are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

Concentration
Risks   

The
Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer
needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities, and other factors could negatively impact the
Company s operating results. State and federal government laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company s
future revenues and results of operations.  

The
Company s products require specific components that currently are available from a limited number of sources. The Company
purchases its key products and components from single vendors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, its ballasts,
lamps and reflectors, which comprised the vast majority of the Company s purchases during those periods, were each only
purchased from one separate vendor. The ballast vendor is a related party (see Note 4).  

The
Company performs a regular review of customer activity and associated credit risks and does not require collateral or other arrangements.
There was one customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2016, accounting for 13%. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. There was one customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Company s revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, accounting for 11%. There were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company s
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 0.9% and 4% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 0.5%
and 3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, three customers accounted for 18%, 13% and 12% of the Company s trade accounts receivable balance,
and as of December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for 15% and 20% of the Company s trade accounts receivable balance.
Customers outside the United States represented 0% and 8% of the Company s trade accounts receivable balance as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Fair
Value measurements   

The
Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price in U.S. dollars that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with
three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:  

Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2    Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
approximate the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires that
inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory measured using
last-in, first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. ASU 2015-11 applies to all other
inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure
inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
ASU 2015-11 is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 on the Company s
financial statements and disclosures.  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09
will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.
The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to
obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities
will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record
a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered
into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and
disclosures.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Supplier    

A
family member of an officer/shareholder owns a minority interest in a company in China, which as of 2014, is the sole supplier
of ballasts to the Company. Purchases from the related party for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately

NOTE 10   INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)  

The components of deferred taxes consist of
the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Deferred income taxes result from temporary
differences between income tax and financial reporting computed at the effective income tax rate. The Company has established a
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. Management
periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. At such time it is determined that it is more likely than
not that deferred tax assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced. 

The Company files U.S. federal and U.S. state
tax returns. The Company s major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the States of California and New Jersey. Such amount
has been accrued and reflected in income taxes payable. Years that are subject to tax examinations are the open years from 2013
through 2015.

Organizational History  

Solis Tek Inc. (the  Company )
was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 2, 2007 as Cinjet, Inc. ( Cinjet ). Effective
September 1, 2015, Cinjet changed its corporate name to Solis Tek Inc. On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement
of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the  Agreement ) with Solis Tek Inc., a California corporation ( STI ),
and CJA Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub ), providing
for the merger of Merger Sub with and into STI (the  Merger ), with STI surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Company s Board of Directors and the sole Director of the Company,
effective June 23, 2015. The Merger closed on June 23, 2015. 

At the effective time of the Merger, each share
of STI common stock issued and outstanding was converted automatically into the right to receive .166 shares of the common stock
of the Company, with an aggregate of 26,187,000 shares of the Company s common stock issued to the former shareholders of
STI. 

Upon the closing of the Merger, STI paid a
total of $22,500 to four shareholders of the Company for the cancellation of a total of 61,297,002 shares of the Company s
common stock. Also at the closing of the Merger, STI paid $198,100 to the Company to settle and pay liabilities of $405,932, which
represented all of the then current liabilities of the Company. After the closing, a total of 29,551,998 shares of the Company
were outstanding. 

Upon completion of the Merger, the former stockholders
of STI owned approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock and the holders of the outstanding
shares of the Company s common stock prior to the Merger owned the balance. As the former owners and management of STI have
voting and operating control of the Company after the Merger, the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization with
the STI deemed the acquiring companies for accounting purposes, and the Company deemed the legal acquirer. Due to the change in
control, the consolidated financial statements reflect the historical results of STI prior to the Merger, and that of the combined
company following the Merger. Common stock and the corresponding capital amounts of the Company pre-Merger have been retroactively
restated as capital stock shares reflecting the exchange ratio in the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill
will be recorded in this transaction and the cash paid by the Company of $248,980 (including $28,380 of transaction costs) has
been reflected as a cost of the transaction. 

Overview of Business  

The Company is focused
on the research, design, development and manufacturing of advanced, energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting and ancillary
equipment. Our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective
manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse
and indoor horticulture markets. 

The Company is a California
corporation that was formed in June of 2010. We commenced our operations immediately by designing, developing and sourcing of a
line of Solis Tek Digital Ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture. An electrical ballast
is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit. A familiar and widely used example is the inductive
ballast used in fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due
to the tube s negative resistance characteristic. Since the commencement of operations, our product line has evolved from
digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from 400 watts to 1,000 watts with
various features, a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps, a line of reflectors, high intensity lighting accessories and
a new line of light emitting diode ( LED ) lighting technologies. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) defines  critical accounting policies  as those that require application of management s
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult,
subjective or complex judgments or estimates. However, the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the SEC definition. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on the Company s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the
allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality, economic
conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates. Trade receivables are written
off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. 

Inventories   

The Company provides inventory
reserves based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The write down amount is measured
as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision
for inventory, which is a component of cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory
is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established
cost basis. 

Inventories under warranty claims   

In the ordinary course
of business, the Company receives product returns from its customers. The product returns are almost entirely ballasts. Since its
inception, the Company has purchased its ballasts from two Chinese manufacturers and one of them (a related entity, see Note 5)
offers a three year warranty on its products. Through September 30, 2016, that manufacturer was not able to repair the Company s
ballasts, as the Company could not return the products to the manufacturer s facility due to Chinese customs reasons. As
such, in late 2015, the related party vendor issued the Company a credit memo for the entire amount of their returned product,
totaling $653,118. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the related party vendor issued the Company additional credit
memos for the entire amount of their returned product during that period, totaling $332,077. The Company is planning to send the
products to a free trade zone in Hong Kong or to another location in China, to repair, or replace, the defective products. As the
manufacturer has issued the Company a credit for all of the defective product, the Company has not recorded a reserve on any of
those products. But, the Company has recorded a reserve on the other manufacturer s products.

Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold  

Revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,877,000 and $1,827,420, respectively. The increase of $49,580 was primarily due
to more market penetration within our hydroponic customers and commercial facilities during the third quarter of 2016, as compared
to the third quarter of the prior year. 

Cost of sales for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $1,236,536 and $1,103,775, respectively. Gross profit for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $640,464 and $723,645, respectively. The gross profit decrease of $83,181 was due to the
reduction in the Company s gross profit margin, which was 34% during the third quarter of 2016 compared to 40% during the
third quarter of 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and development
( R D ) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $57,500 and $62,674, respectively.
The decrease in R D expenses of $5,174 was due to the decrease in R D material costs during the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the third quarter of 2015. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative
( SG A ) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $767,239 and $687,690, respectively.
The increase in SG A expenses of $79,549 was due primarily to the increase in labor costs of $31,725 and stock compensation
costs of $25,000, plus an increase in other SG A expenses. 

Other Expenses  

Interest expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $26,885 and $13,806, respectively. The increase in interest expense of $13,079
was due to the three loans payable agreements the Company entered into during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the two
related party loans payable the Company entered into in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $173,460 and our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $28,661.
The increase in the net loss of $144,799 was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit of $83,181 and increase in SG A
expenses of $79,549, offset by the decrease in R D expenses of $5,174. 

Results of Operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold  

Revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,587,498 and $5,762,547, respectively. The increase of $824,951 was primarily due to additional
market penetration within our hydroponic customers and commercial facilities during the first nine months of 2016, as compared
to the first nine months of the prior year. 

Cost of sales for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $4,219,412 and $3,559,699, respectively. Gross profit for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $2,368,086 and $2,202,848, respectively. The gross profit increase of $165,238 was due to the
increase in revenue, as the Company s gross profit margin was 36% during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 38% during
the first nine months of 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and development
( R D ) expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $172,500 and $157,899, respectively.

to the first nine months of 2015. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative
( SG A ) expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,286,464 and $2,033,504, respectively.
The increase in SG A expenses of $252,960 was due primarily to the increase in labor costs of $120,427 and stock compensation
costs of $86,000, plus an increase in other SG A expenses. 

Other Income (Expenses)  

Interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $77,279 and $38,044, respectively. The increase in interest expense of $39,235
was due to the three loans payable agreements the Company entered into during the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the two
related party loans payable the Company entered into in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016. In June 2015,
the Company entered into a merger agreement with STI. Costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015 relating to the merger were
$248,980. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $163,657 and our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $285,169.
The decrease in net loss of $121,512 was primarily due to the merger costs of $248,980 during the second quarter of 2015,
but was also due to the increase in gross profit of $165,238, offset by the increase in SG A expenses of $252,960 and R D
expenses of $14,601. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability
of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on
an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016    

Cash flows used in
operating activities  

During the nine months

operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The reasons for the increase in cash provided by operating
activities in the amount of $1,862,384 was due mainly to the decrease in inventories of $2,830,667, offset by the increase in accounts
receivable of $310,025, and the decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $292,668 and due to related party vendor
of $1,165,195. 

Cash flows used in
investing activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we had purchases of property and equipment of $140,188, while during the nine months ended September

As of December 31, 2015, we had $106,316 in
cash, working capital of $1,590,461 and an accumulated deficit of $881,963. 

Through May 2016, the Company had a revolving
line of credit with a bank in which it could borrow up to $600,000. The line of credit expired May 1, 2016. Borrowings under the
line of credit bore interest at 4.75%. The line of credit was secured by substantially all assets of the Company and a personal
guarantee from one of the Company s officers/shareholders, including his personal residence. The outstanding balance on the
line of credit was $600,000 at December 31, 2015. The line of credit was terminated after the balance was fully paid in May 2016. 

In September 2015, the Company entered into
a Business Loan and Security Agreement, under which the Company can borrow up to $500,000. The loan matures in September 2016 and
is secured by credit card collections and certain Company assets. The agreement requires the Company to repay the loan from the
credit card deposits it receives from its customers. The repayment rate is 21% of each deposit. The loan does not accrue interest
but includes a non-refundable fee of $40,000, which can be reduced if paid early. In September 2015, the Company borrowed $500,000
under the agreement. At December 31, 2015, $341,035 was owed on the loan. At September 30, 2016, no amount was owed on the loan. 

In 2015, the Company entered into two loan
agreements to purchase automobiles. The combined principal amount of the loans was $44,093 and they mature by November 2021. The
loans require a combined monthly payment of principal and interest of $747. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a total
of $36,523 and $42, 273, respectively, was owed on the loans.

and is due on or before December 31, 2016. A total of $60,000 was owed on the loan as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
In January 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $110,000 from relatives of one of the Company s officers/shareholders.
The loan accrues interest at 10% per annum, is unsecured and is currently due. 

In May 2016, the Company entered into two separate
notes payable agreements with the same two officers/shareholders. Under each of the agreements, the Company borrowed $300,000.
The notes accrue interest at 8% per annum, are unsecured and are due on or before May 31, 2018. A total of $600,000 was due on
the combined notes at September 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures   

Based upon an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the end of the period
covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not been effective
as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As used herein,   disclosure
controls and procedures   mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f) under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based on management s evaluation
under the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September
30, 2016. 

We identified material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of incompatible duties;
and (ii) insufficient Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period
covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent
financial consultant to record and review all financial data, as well as prepare our financial reports, in order to mitigate this
weakness. Although management will periodically re-evaluate this situation, at this point it considers that the risk associated
with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified.
We intend to hire additional accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. 

This quarterly report
does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

No changes in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting
