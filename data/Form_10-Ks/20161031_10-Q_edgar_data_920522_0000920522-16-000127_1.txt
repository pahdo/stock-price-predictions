EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This report combines the reports on Form 10-Q for the three and   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   of Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to  Essex  mean Essex Property Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ), and references to  EPLP  mean Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ). References to the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  mean collectively Essex, EPLP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Essex and/or EPLP.  References to the  Operating Partnership  mean collectively EPLP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EPLP. 
    
  Essex is the general partner of EPLP and as the sole general partner of EPLP, Essex has exclusive control of EPLP's day-to-day management. 
    
  The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT ( UPREIT ) and Essex contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, Essex receives a number of OP Units (see definition below) in the Operating Partnership equal to the number of shares of common stock it has issued in the equity offering.  Contributions of properties to the Company can be structured as tax-deferred transactions through the issuance of OP Units in the Operating Partnership, which is one of the reasons why the Company is structured in the manner outlined above. Based on the terms of EPLP's partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged into Essex common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units of the Operating Partnership issued to Essex and shares of common stock. 
    
  The Company believes that combining the reports on Form 10-Q of Essex and EPLP into this single report provides the following benefits: 

enhances investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
                
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
       
  Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Essex consists of the same members as the management of EPLP. 
    
  All of the Company's property ownership, development, and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and Essex has no material assets, other than its investment in EPLP. Essex's primary function is acting as the general partner of EPLP. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. Essex also issues equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of EPLP, as disclosed in this report. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by the Company, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ) (on a one-for-one share of common stock per OP Unit basis), the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business. These sources include the Operating Partnership's working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from disposition of certain properties and joint ventures. 
    
  The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between Essex and EPLP in the context of how Essex and EPLP operate as a consolidated company. Stockholders' equity, partners' capital and noncontrolling interest are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interest in Essex s consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements include the interest of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships and joint venture partners. The noncontrolling interest in the Company's consolidated financial statements include (i) the same noncontrolling interest as presented in the Operating Partnership s consolidated financial statements and (ii) limited partner OP Unitholders of the Operating Partnership. The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' capital result from differences in the equity issued at the Company and Operating Partnership levels. 

iii 

To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of stockholders' equity or partners' capital, and earnings per share/unit, as applicable; and a combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C.  1350. 
    
  In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company is one business and the Company operates that business through the Operating Partnership. The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company. 
    
  The information furnished in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, capital, and cash flows of the Company and the Operating Partnership reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the aforementioned condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods and are normal and recurring in nature, except as otherwise noted. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to such unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. Additionally, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

(1) Organization and Basis of Presentation  
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Essex Property Trust, Inc. ( Essex  or the  Company ), which include the accounts of the Company and Essex Portfolio, L.P. and subsidiaries (the  Operating Partnership,  which holds the operating assets of the Company), prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented have been included and are normal and recurring in nature. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to the current year s presentation.  
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include the accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership. Essex is the sole general partner in the Operating Partnership, with a   96.7%   general partnership interest as of   September 30, 2016  . Total Operating Partnership limited partnership units outstanding were   2,219,268   and   2,214,545   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and the redemption value of the units, based on the closing price of the Company s common stock totaled   $494.2 million   and   $530.2 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned or had ownership interests in   244   stabilized apartment communities, aggregating   59,290   apartment homes, excluding the Company s ownership in preferred interest co-investments, (collectively, the  Communities , and individually, a  Community ),   three   operating commercial buildings and   six   active developments (collectively, the  Portfolio ). The Communities are located in Southern California (primarily Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties), Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area) and the Seattle metropolitan areas. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." The new standard provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts with customers (excluding certain contracts, such as lease contracts) to improve comparability within industries. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be paid in exchange for those goods and services and provide enhanced disclosures, all to provide more comprehensive guidance for transactions such as service revenue and contract modifications. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year, and it is now effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. The new standard may be applied using either a full retrospective or a modified approach upon adoption. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities", which requires changes to the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity securities and to the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that this will have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 "Leases", which requires an entity that is a lessee to classify leases as either finance or operating and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases that have a duration of greater than 12 months. Leases of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. For lessors, accounting for leases under the new standard will be substantially the same as existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases, but eliminates current real estate specific provisions and changes the treatment of initial direct costs. The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new standard must be applied using a modified retrospective approach.

  ESSEX PORTFOLIO, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 and 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07 "Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting", which eliminates the requirement to retroactively adjust an investment, results of operations, and retained earnings when the investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of this to be material on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 "Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting", which amends certain aspects of how an entity accounts for share-based payments to employees. This amendment requires entities to recognize the income tax effects of share-based awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, rather than recording such effects in additional paid-in capital. Entities will also be permitted to elect to account for forfeitures  of share-based payments as they occur or continue with the current practice which requires estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change. The new standard will be effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The change in recognition of income tax effects of share-based awards will be applied prospectively. If the Company elects to account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur, such change will be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to distributions in excess of accumulated earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 "Measure of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which amends the current approach to estimate credit losses on certain financial assets, including trade and other receivables, available-for-sale securities, and other financial instruments. Generally, this amendment requires entities to establish a valuation allowance for the expected lifetime losses of these certain financial assets. Subsequent changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in current earnings and reversal of previous losses are permitted. Currently, U.S. GAAP requires companies to write down credit losses only when losses are probable and loss reversals are not permitted. The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which requires entities to adhere to a uniform classification and presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted, The Company does not expect the impact of the other items identified in the ASU to be material on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
    
  Marketable Securities 
    
  The Company reports its available for sale securities at fair value, based on quoted market prices (Level 1 for the common stock and investment funds and Level 2 for the unsecured bonds, as defined by the FASB standard for fair value measurements), and any unrealized gain or loss is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses, interest income, and amortization of purchase discounts are included in interest and other income on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , marketable securities consisted primarily of investment-grade unsecured bonds, common stock, investments in mortgage backed securities, investment funds that invest in U.S. treasury or agency securities.

The Company uses the specific identification method to determine the cost basis of a security sold and to reclassify amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income for securities sold.  
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities totaled   $3.5 million   and   none  , respectively, which resulted in   $1.0 million   realized gains and   no   realized gains or losses, respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities totaled   $14.7 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, which resulted in   $2.9 million   realized gains and   no   realized gains or losses, respectively. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the proceeds from sales of other investments totaled   $5.6 million  , which resulted in   $0.6 million   realized gains. The Company did not own any other investments during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 "Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis," which provides new consolidation guidance and makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. Among other changes, the new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. Based on the Company s evaluation of the new standard, it determined that no change was required to its accounting for variable interest entities ( VIEs ). However, under the guidance of ASU No. 2015-02,   9   previously consolidated co-investments now meet the definition of a VIE and requires additional disclosure about these VIEs which the Company continues to consolidate as they were determined to be the primary beneficiary.  
    
  The Company continues to be the primary beneficiary and consolidates the Operating Partnership and   19   DownREIT limited partnerships (comprising   eleven   communities). Commencing on January 1, 2016,   9   other consolidated co-investments were determined to be VIEs and the Company continues to consolidate those co-investments as the Company was determined to be

the primary beneficiary. The consolidated total assets and liabilities related to the   9   consolidated co-investments and   19   DownREIT limited partnerships, net of intercompany eliminations, were approximately   $954.6 million   and   $267.3 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   $893.1 million   and   $231.8 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . Noncontrolling interests in these entities was   $52.3 million   and   $54.6 million   as of    September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company's financial risk in each VIE is limited to its equity investment in the VIE. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any other VIEs of which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary and did not have any VIEs of which it was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
    
  Equity-based Compensation 
    
  The cost of share and unit based compensation awards is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the awards.  The estimated fair value of stock options and restricted stock granted by the Company are being amortized over the vesting period.  The estimated grant date fair values of the long term incentive plan units (discussed in Note 13,  Equity Based Compensation Plans,  in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  ) are being amortized over the expected service periods. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  Management believes that the carrying amounts of the outstanding balances under its lines of credit, and notes and other receivables approximate fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , because interest rates, yields, and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available for similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair value of the Company s   $5.0 billion   of fixed rate debt, including unsecured debt, at   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $5.3 billion   and the Company s variable rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 approximates its fair value based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable, unsecured debt, and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace. Management believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, construction payables, other liabilities, and dividends payable approximate fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. Marketable securities, except mortgage backed securities that are held to maturity, and derivatives are carried at fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investments in mortgage backed securities had a carrying value of   $91.0 million   and the Company estimated the fair value to be approximately   $105.9 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company s investments in mortgage backed securities had a carrying value of   $80.4 million   and the Company estimated the fair value to be approximately   $110.2 million  . The Company determines the fair value of the mortgage backed securities based on unobservable inputs (level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) considering the assumptions that market participants would make in valuing these securities.  Assumptions such as estimated default rates and discount rates are used to determine expected discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value. 
    
  Capitalization of Costs 
    
  The Company s capitalized internal costs related to development and redevelopment projects were comprised primarily of employee compensation and totaled   $3.8 million   and   $2.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10.6 million   and   $8.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company capitalizes leasing commissions associated with the lease-up of development communities and amortizes the costs over the life of the leases. The amounts capitalized for leasing commissions are immaterial for all periods presented. 
    
  Co-investments 
    
  The Company owns investments in joint ventures ( co-investments ) in which it has significant influence, but its ownership interest does not meet the criteria for consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the Company accounts for co-investments using the equity method of accounting. The equity method employs the accrual basis for recognizing the investor s share of investee income or losses. In addition, distributions received from the investee are treated as a reduction in the investment account, not as income. The significant accounting policies of the Company s co-investment entities are consistent with those of the Company in all material respects.

Upon the acquisition of a controlling interest of a co-investment, the co-investment entity is consolidated and a gain or loss is recognized upon the remeasurement of co-investments in the condensed consolidated statement of income equal to the amount by which the fair value of the co-investment interest the Company previously owned exceeds its carrying value.  A majority of the co-investments, excluding the preferred equity investments, compensate the Company for its asset management services and some of these investments may provide promote income if certain financial return benchmarks are achieved. Asset management fees are recognized when earned, and promote fees are recognized when the earnings events have occurred and the amount is determinable and collectible. Any promote fees are reflected in equity income from co-investments.

  Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with GAAP, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing, and assessing the carrying values of its real estate portfolio, its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates, its notes receivables, and its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ). The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions.

(9) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of   $225 million   that effectively fixed the interest rate on the   $225 million   unsecured term loan at   2.4%  . These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has interest rate caps, which are not accounted for as hedges, totaling a notional amount of   $20.7 million   that effectively limit the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate for   $20.7 million   of the Company s tax exempt variable rate debt. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of   $0.2 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The aggregate carrying value of the interest rate caps was   zero   on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges, which is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated income statements, net was not significant for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Additionally, the Company has entered into total return swaps that effectively convert   $257.3 million   of mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on SIFMA plus a spread. The total return swaps provide fair market value protection on the mortgage notes payable to our counterparties during the initial period of the total return swap until the Company's option to call the mortgage notes at par can be exercised. The Company can currently call the total return swaps with   $114.4 million   of the outstanding debt at par, while the call option on the total return swaps relating to the remaining   $142.9 million   of outstanding debt can be exercised starting on January 1, 2017. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and had a carrying and fair value of   $16 thousand   and   $4 thousand   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These total return swaps are scheduled to mature between   September 2021   and   November 2022  . Realized gains of    $3.1 million   and   $9.1 million   are reported in the condensed consolidated income statements as total return swap income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. There was no total return swap income for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of   September 30, 2016  , had an approximately   96.7%   general partner interest in the Operating Partnership.  
    
  The Company s investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring of existing markets, and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the characteristics that underlie rental growth. The Company s strong financial condition supports its investment strategy by enhancing its ability to quickly shift acquisition, development, redevelopment, and disposition activities to markets that will optimize the performance of the portfolio. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had ownership interests in   244   stabilized apartment communities, comprising   59,290   apartment homes, excluding the Company s ownership in preferred equity interest co-investments, and the Company also had ownership interests in   three   operating commercial buildings with approximately   154,465   square feet and   six   active developments. The Company s apartment communities are predominately located in the following major regions: 
    
  Southern California   (Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties) 
  Northern California   (the San Francisco Bay Area) 
  Seattle     Metro   (Seattle metropolitan area) 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s development pipeline was comprised of   two   consolidated projects under development,   four   unconsolidated joint venture projects under development, and various consolidated predevelopment projects all aggregating   2,223   apartment homes, with total incurred costs of   $0.6 billion  , and estimated remaining project costs of   $0.7 billion   for total estimated project costs of   $1.3 billion  . 
    
  The Company s consolidated apartment communities are as follows: 

Co-investments, including Wesco I, LLC ("Wesco I"), Wesco III, LLC ("Wesco III"), Wesco IV, LLC ( Wesco IV ), Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB" or "CPP"), Palm Valley, and BEXAEW, LLC ( BEXAEW )     communities, developments under construction, and preferred equity interest co-investment communities are not included in the table presented above for both periods.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  The Company s average financial occupancies for the Company s stabilized apartment communities or  Quarterly Same-Property  (stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ) was   96.5%   and   96.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes, with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate. 
    
  Market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes. The Company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community s market. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the Company's calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other REITs. 
    
  The Company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes. The calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes, and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions. For apartment communities that are development properties in lease-up without stabilized occupancy figures, the Company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric. While an apartment community is in the lease-up phase, the Company s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives, and thus financial occupancy, which is based on contractual revenue, is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy. 
    
  The regional breakdown of the Company s Quarterly Same-Property portfolio for financial occupancy for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

The following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts, including revenues attributable to the Quarterly Same-Properties: 

Quarterly Same-Property Revenues   increased by   $18.7 million   or   6.9%   to   $291.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $272.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 6.0% in average rental rates from $1,969 per apartment home in the   third   quarter of 2015 to $2,087 per apartment home in the   third   quarter of   2016  .  

26 

Quarterly Non-Same Property Revenues   increased by   $5.8 million   or   19.7%   to   $35.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $29.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase was primarily due to revenue generated by the acquisition or consolidation of six communities, net of dispositions, since July 1, 2015. 
    
  Management and other fees from affiliates   remained relatively flat at   $2.1 million   in both the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , reflecting no significant changes in management and other fee activity from joint ventures. 
    
  Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes   increased   $3.3 million   to   $63.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $60.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to the acquisition or consolidation of six communities, net of dispositions, since July 1, 2015 and increases in property management fees. Quarterly Same-Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by $2.2 million or 3.9% for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in property management fees and an increase of $0.6 million in maintenance and repairs. 
    
  Real estate taxes   increased by   $2.0 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015 due primarily to the acquisition or consolidation of six communities, net of dispositions, since July 1, 2015 and increases in tax rates and property valuations. Quarterly Same-Property real estate taxes increased by $1.0 million or 3.3% for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015 primarily due to increases in tax rates and property valuations.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased by $  5.8 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015, due to the amortization of a larger amount of acquired in-place leases during the   third   quarter of 2015 compared to the   third   quarter of 2016, partially offset by an increase due to the acquisition or consolidation of six communities, net of dispositions, since July 1, 2015. 
    
  Interest expense   increased   $6.6 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015, primarily due to the $450.0 million senior unsecured notes due on April 15, 2026 issued in April 2016 which resulted in $3.9 million interest expense for the   third   quarter of 2016 and none for the   third   quarter of 2015. In addition, capitalized interest decreased $0.7 million in the   third   quarter of  2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015, which was due to a decrease in development costs as compared to the same period in 2015. 
    
  Total return swap income   of   $3.1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 consists of monthly settlements related to the Company's total return swap contracts that were entered into during 2015 in connection with $257.3 million of fixed rate tax-exempt mortgage notes payable. There was no total return swap income for the   third   quarter of 2015. 
    
  Interest and other income   decreased by   $2.4 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015 primarily due a decrease of  $3.0 million in insurance reimbursements and legal settlements partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million in income from the sale of marketable securities. 
    
  Equity income in co-investments   increased   $2.4 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015 primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in income from preferred equity investment, which was primarily attributable to three new preferred equity investments made during 2016. 
    
  Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Our average financial occupancies for the Company s stabilized apartment communities or  2016/2015 Same-Property  (stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ) was   96.2%   and   96.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The regional breakdown of the Company s 2016/2015 Same-Property portfolio for financial occupancy for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

27 

The following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts, including revenues attributable to the 2016/2015 Same-Properties: 

2016/2015 Same-Property Revenues   increased by   $56.2 million   or   7.0%   to   $856.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $800.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 6.8% in average rental rates from $1,921 per apartment home for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to $2,052 per apartment home for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  2016/2015 Non-Same Property Revenues   increased by   $25.8 million   or   33.6%   to   $102.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $76.8 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to revenue generated by the acquisition or consolidation of ten communities, net of dispositions, since January 1, 2015. 
    
  Management and other fees from affiliates   decreased by   $0.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily due to the loss of asset and management fees in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , associated with the Company's purchase of the joint venture partner's remaining membership interest in The Huxley, The Dylan, and Reveal communities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and the sale of certain communities.  
    
  Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes   increased   $11.8 million   to   $185.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $173.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the acquisition or consolidation of ten communities, net of dispositions, since January 1, 2015 and increases in property management fees. 2016/2015 Same-Property operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased by $7.8 million or 4.8% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in property management fees and a $2.1 million increase in maintenance and repairs. 
    
  Real estate taxes   increased by   $6.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due primarily to the acquisition or consolidation of ten communities, net of dispositions, since January 1, 2015 and increases in tax rates and property valuations. 2016/2015 Same-Property real estate taxes increased by $1.9 million or 2.2% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to increases in tax rates and property valuations.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased by   $7.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to the amortization of a larger amount of acquired in-place leases during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , partially offset by an increase due to the acquisition or consolidation of ten communities, net of dispositions, since January 1, 2015. 
    
  Merger and integration expenses   include, but are not limited to, advisor fees, legal, and accounting fees related to the merger with BRE and related integration activity. There were no merger and integration expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Interest expense   increased   $16.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the $500.0 million senior unsecured notes due on April 1, 2025 issued in March 2015 and the $450.0 million senior unsecured notes due on April 15, 2026 issued in April 2016 which resulted in an increase of $11.0 million in interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These additions were offset by the reduction in interest expense due to the payoff of $150.0 million in private placement  
  
   28 

unsecured bonds. In addition, capitalized interest decreased $3.0 million for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was due to a decrease in development costs. 
    
  Total return swap income   of   $9.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consists of monthly settlements related to the Company's total return swap contracts that were entered into during 2015 in connection with $257.3 million of fixed rate tax-exempt mortgage notes payable. There was no total return swap income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest and other income   increased by   $4.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to an increase of $2.5 million in marketable securities and other interest income and $2.3 million in income from the sale of marketable securities. 
    
  Equity income in co-investments   increased   $23.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to $13.0 million in income on the gain on the sale of two co-investment communities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Gain on sale of real estate and land   increased by   $13.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a $10.7 million gain on the sale of Harvest Park before tax expense and a $9.6 million gain on the sale of the Company's former headquarters office building during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to $7.1 million in gains on the sales of Pinnacle South Mountain and two commercial buildings during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Deferred tax expense on gain on sale of real estate and land   of   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was recorded due to the sale of Harvest Park, which was owned by our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary. There was no current tax expense on the sale of real estate and land for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , because Harvest Park was sold in a like-kind exchange transaction. 
    
  Gain on remeasurement of co-investment   of   $34.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was due to a remeasurement of the Company's investments, caused by the Company's purchase of the joint venture partner's remaining membership interest in The Huxley, The Dylan, and Reveal co-investments. There were no gains on remeasurement of co-investments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $195.2 million   of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and   $153.7 million   in marketable securities, of which   $62.8 million   were available for sale. We believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months. The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect our plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), Moody s Investor Service ("Moody's"), and Standard and Poor's ( S P ) credit agencies rate Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. BBB+/Stable, Baa2/Positive, and BBB/Positive, respectively. Moody's and S P issued upgrades to Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Stable in October 2016.  
    
  The Company has two lines of unsecured credit aggregating $1.03 billion. The Company has a $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit, and as of   September 30, 2016  , there were no amounts outstanding on the line. The underlying interest rate is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings and was LIBOR plus 0.90% as of   September 30, 2016  . This facility matures in December 2019 with one 18-month extension, exercisable at the Company s option. The Company has a working capital unsecured line of credit agreement for $25.0 million. This facility matures in January 2018. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no amounts outstanding on the $25.0 million unsecured line. The underlying interest rate on the $25.0 million line is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings and was LIBOR plus 0.90% as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  In April 2016, the Company issued $450 million of 3.375% senior unsecured notes that mature in April 2026. The interest is paid semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2016 until the maturity date of April 15, 2026. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness under its unsecured lines of credit and for other general corporate and working capital purposes.  

29 

In April 2016, the Company redeemed all of the issued and outstanding 2,950,000 shares of the Company's 7.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $25.00 per share, or a total of $73.8 million in cash.  
    
  The Company has entered into equity distribution agreements with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co, Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNB Paribas Securities Corp., Capital One Securities, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Jefferies LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., and UBS Securities LLC. The Company has not issued any shares pursuant to its equity distribution program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and through   October 27, 2016  .  
    
  Essex pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution. Until it is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the Company primarily in investment grade securities held available for sale or is used by the Company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit.   
    
  Development and Predevelopment Pipeline 
    
  The Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s development pipeline was comprised of   two   consolidated projects under development and   four   unconsolidated joint venture projects under development, all aggregating   2,223   apartment homes, with total incurred costs of   $0.6 billion  , and estimated remaining project costs of approximately   $0.7 billion  , $0.6 billion of which represents the Company's estimated remaining costs, for total estimated project costs of   $1.3 billion  . 
    
  The Company expects to fund the development and predevelopment pipeline by using a combination of some or all of the following sources: its working capital, amounts available on its lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of assets, if any. 
    
  Redevelopment Pipeline 
    
  The Company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement. During redevelopment, apartment homes may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had ownership interests in   four   major redevelopment communities aggregating   1,213   apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of   $149.9 million  , of which approximately   $53.7 million   remains to be expended. The Company has the ability to cease funding of the redevelopment pipeline as needed. 
    
  Derivative Activity 
    
  The Company uses interest rate swaps, interest rate cap, and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  
    
  Alternative Capital Sources 
    
  The Company utilizes co-investments as an alternative source of capital for acquisitions of both operating and development communities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an interest in 1,427 apartment homes of communities actively under development with joint ventures for total estimated costs of $0.8 billion. Total estimated remaining costs total approximately $0.4 billion, of which the Company estimates that our remaining investment in these development joint ventures will be approximately $0.2 billion. In addition, the Company had an interest in 10,237 apartment homes of operating communities with joint ventures for a total book value of $0.8 billion as of   September 30, 2016  .

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the Company s management to exercise their most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates relate principally to the following key areas: (i) accounting for business combinations (ii) consolidation under applicable accounting standards for entities that are not wholly owned; (iii) assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates; and (iv) internal cost capitalization. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by management. 
    
  The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed materially from the information reported in Note 2,  Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting Policies,  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
     
  Forward Looking Statements 
    
  Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the Company's expectations, hopes, intentions, beliefs and strategies regarding the future. Forward looking statements include statements regarding the Company s expectations as to the total projected costs of predevelopment, development and redevelopment projects, beliefs as to our ability to meet our cash needs during the next twelve months and to fund the Company s development and redevelopment pipeline, the expected impact of lawsuits on the Company, and statements regarding the Company's financing activities. 
    
  Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including, but not limited to, that the Company will fail to achieve its business objectives, that the total projected costs of current predevelopment, development and redevelopment projects will exceed expectations, that such development and redevelopment projects will not be completed, that development and redevelopment projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations, that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements, that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the Company's properties are located, that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness, and that lawsuits will be more costly than anticipated, as well as those risks, special considerations, and other factors referred to in Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update this information. 
    
  Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders  
    
  Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ("FFO") is a financial measure that is commonly used in the REIT industry.  The Company presents funds from operations as a supplemental operating performance measure. FFO is not used by the Company as, nor should it be considered to be, an alternative to net earnings computed under GAAP as an indicator of the Company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP as an indicator of the Company s ability to fund its cash needs. 
    
  FFO is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor does it intend to present, a complete picture of the Company's financial condition and operating performance. The Company believes that net earnings computed under GAAP is the primary measure of performance and that FFO is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings. The Company considers FFO and FFO excluding non-recurring items and acquisition costs (referred to as  Core FFO ) to be useful financial performance measurements of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and ability to pay dividends. Further, the Company believes that its consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance. 

31 

In calculating FFO, the Company follows the definition for this measure published by the National Association of REITs ( NAREIT ), which is a REIT trade association. The Company believes that, under the NAREIT FFO definition, the two most significant adjustments made to net income are (i) the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and (ii) the exclusion of gains and losses (including impairment charges on depreciable real estate) from the sale of previously depreciated properties. The Company agrees that these two NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors for the following reason: 
    
           (a) 
    historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on Funds from Operations  since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  Consequently, NAREIT s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities. 
       
           (b) 
    REITs were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate.  The exclusion, in NAREIT s definition of FFO, of gains and losses (including impairment charges on depreciable real estate) from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. 
       
  Management believes that it has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented.  However, there is judgment involved and other REITs  calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosure of FFO may not be comparable to the Company s calculation. 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s calculation of FFO and Core FFO for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands except for share and per share data):

(1) Assumes conversion of all outstanding operating partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and excludes all DownREIT units for which the Operating Partnership has the ability and intention to redeem the DownREIT limited partnership units for cash and does not consider them to be common stock equivalents. 
    
  Net Operating Income ( NOI ) 
    
  Net Operating Income ("NOI") and same-property NOI are considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company s consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes.  Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (Dollars in thousands):

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
    
  Interest Rate Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has entered into   seven   interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows on its   $225.0 million   variable rate five-year unsecured term debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had   $291.7 million   of variable rate indebtedness, of which   $20.7 million   is subject to interest rate cap protection. All of the Company's interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes the notional amount, carrying value, and estimated fair value of the Company s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . The notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rates, or market risks. The table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the Company s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10-year Treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points, as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Additionally, the Company has entered into total return swap contracts, with an aggregate notional amount of   $257.3 million   that effectively converts   $257.3 million   of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on SIFMA plus a spread and has a carrying value of   $16 thousand   at   September 30, 2016  . These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
    
  Interest Rate Sensitive Liabilities 
    
  The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long-term tax exempt variable rate debt and unsecured term debt. The Company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 

34 

The Company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows. 

(1)   $225.0 million   is subject to interest rate swap agreements. 
  (2)   $20.7 million   is subject to interest rate caps. 
  (3)   $257.3 million   is subject to total return swaps. 
    
  The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of   September 30, 2016  ; it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, the Company's ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise prior to settlement. 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
    
  Essex Property Trust, Inc.

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
