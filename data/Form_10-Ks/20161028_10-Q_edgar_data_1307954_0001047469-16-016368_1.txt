epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments.   

          We
operate in five segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials, Textile Effects, and Pigments and Additives. Our Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced
Materials and Textile Effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our Pigments and Additives segment produces inorganic chemical products. In a series of transactions
beginning in 2006, we sold or shutdown substantially all of our Australian styrenics operations and our North American polymers and base chemicals operations. We report the results of these businesses
as discontinued operations.   

COMPANY     

          Our Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2004 to hold the Huntsman businesses. Jon M. Huntsman founded the predecessor
to our Company in 1970 as a small packaging company.

  Since
then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses.   

          Currently,
we operate all of our businesses through Huntsman International, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Huntsman International is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed in
1999.   

HUNTSMAN CORPORATION AND HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     

          Except where otherwise indicated, these notes relate to the condensed consolidated financial statements for both our Company and Huntsman
International. The differences between our financial statements and Huntsman International's financial statements relate primarily to the following:  

purchase accounting recorded at our Company for the 2003 step-acquisition of Huntsman International Holdings LLC, the former parent
company of Huntsman International that was merged into Huntsman International in 2005;   
            the different capital structures; and   
            a note payable from Huntsman International to us.    

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION     

          Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and any variable
interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS     

Separation of our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects Businesses     

          In connection with our previously announced plans to separate our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses through a U.S. tax-free
spin-off to our stockholders, on October 28, 2016, Huntsman Spin Corporation ("SpinCo") filed an initial registration statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"). Subject to market conditions, we expect the spin-off to be completed in the first half of 2017.   

Sale of European Surfactants Manufacturing Facilities     

          On August 3, 2016, we announced that Innospec Inc. ("Innospec") had committed to purchase our European surfactants business for an
enterprise value of $225 million pursuant to the terms of an Exclusivity and Put Option Agreement under which we could, by notice to Innospec, exercise an option to enter into an agreed form
Share and Asset Purchase Agreement (the "SAPA") with Innospec. We have provided that notice and, as of October 25, 2016, we and Innospec have each signed the SAPA and an amendment thereto.
Under the terms of the transaction, Innospec will acquire our manufacturing facilities located in Saint-Mihiel, France; Castiglione delle Stiviere, Italy; and Barcelona, Spain. The $225 million
enterprise value includes our related trade receivables and payables, which we will retain. The purchase price will be subject to additional working capital and other adjustments. Closing is expected
to occur by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary

  conditions.
We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale to repay debt. The assets and liabilities of this business are included in our Performance Products segment and are classified as held for
sale on the accompanying balance sheets.   

          Upon
consummating the planned transaction, we will enter into supply and long-term tolling arrangements with Innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to
our global agrochemicals, lubes and certain other businesses.   

USE OF ESTIMATES     

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   

2. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During 2016     

          In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-01,     Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary
Items   , eliminating from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Reporting entities will no longer have to assess whether a particular event or transaction event is
extraordinary. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the amendments in this ASU
effective January 1, 2016, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this ASU did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   . The
amendments in this ASU change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when
determining a controlling financial interest. These amendments affect areas specific to limited partnerships and similar legal entities, evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or service provider as
a variable interest, the effects of both fee arrangements and related parties on the primary beneficiary determination and certain investment funds. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the amendments in this ASU effective January 1, 2016, and the initial adoption of the
amendments in this ASU did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,    Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   . The amendments in this ASU provide guidance that will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a
customer in a cloud computing arrangement, including whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer
should account for the software license consistent with the acquisition of other software

  licenses;
otherwise, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted the amendments in this ASU effective January 1, 2016, and the initial adoption of the amendments in this ASU did not have a significant
impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption in Future Periods     

          In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606)   , outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current
revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date   , deferring the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Further, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   , clarifying the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   , clarifying the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations in a contract and determining whether an
entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's
intellectual property (which is satisfied over time), and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients   , providing clarifications and practical expedients for certain narrow aspects in Topic 606. The amendments in these ASUs are effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments in ASU No. 2014-09, ASU No. 2016-08, ASU
No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 should be applied retrospectively, and early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the amendments in ASU
No. 2014-09, ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,    Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   . The amendments in
this ASU do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in first-out ("LIFO") or the retail inventory method, but rather does apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is
measured using first-in first-out or average cost. An entity should measure in scope inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in
the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail
inventory method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this ASU should
be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect the adoption of the amendments in this ASU to have a
significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)   . The amendments in this ASU will increase transparency and
comparability among entities by recognizing lease assets and lease

  liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU will require lessees to recognize in the statement of financial position a
liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU are effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application of the amendments in this ASU is permitted for all entities. Reporting entities
are required to recognize and measure leases under these amendments at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of
the adoption of the amendments in this ASU on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting   . The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption of the amendments in this ASU is permitted in any interim or annual period. We do not expect the adoption of the amendments in
this ASU to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments   . The amendments in this ASU clarify and include specific guidance to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in
the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We do not expect the adoption of the
amendments in this ASU to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

3. INVENTORIES     

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using LIFO, first-in first-out, and average cost methods for different components of inventory. Inventories
consisted of the following (dollars in millions):

3. INVENTORIES (Continued)    

          For
both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 9% of inventories were recorded using the LIFO cost method. As of September 30, 2016, there was
$18 million of inventories included in current assets held for sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.   

4. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES     

We evaluate our investments and transactions to identify variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. We hold a variable interest in the following joint ventures
for which we are the primary beneficiary:  

Rubicon LLC is our 50%-owned joint venture with Chemtura that manufactures products for our Polyurethanes and Performance Products
segments. The structure of the joint venture is such that the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its activities without additional financial
support. By virtue of the operating agreement with this joint venture, we purchase a majority of the output, absorb a majority of the operating costs and provide a majority of the additional funding.    
            Pacific Iron Products Sdn Bhd is our 50%-owned joint venture with Coogee Chemicals that manufactures products for our Pigments and Additives
segment. In this joint venture, we supply all the raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers.
Through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with the joint venture, we are exposed to risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing.   
            Arabian Amines Company is our 50%-owned joint venture with Zamil group that manufactures products for our Performance Products segment. As
required in the operating agreement governing this joint venture, we purchase all of Arabian Amines Company's production and sell it to our customers. Substantially all of the joint venture's
activities are conducted on our behalf.   
            Sasol-Huntsman is our 50%-owned joint venture with Sasol that owns and operates a maleic anhydride facility in Moers, Germany. This joint
venture manufactures products for our Performance Products segment. The joint venture uses our technology and expertise, and we bear a disproportionate amount of risk of loss due to a related-party
loan to Sasol-Huntsman for which we bear the default risk.   
            Viance, LLC ("Viance") is our 50%-owned joint venture with Dow Chemical. Viance markets timber treatment products for our Pigments and
Additives segment. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of
working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance's behalf.    

Creditors
of these entities have no recourse to our general credit. See "Note 6. Debt Direct and Subsidiary Debt." As the primary beneficiary of these variable
interest entities at September 30, 2016, the joint ventures' assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          The
following table summarizes the carrying amount of our variable interest entities' assets and liabilities included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, before intercompany
eliminations, as

2016 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES     

          In December 2015, our Performance Products segment announced plans for a reorganization of its commercial and technical functions and a
refocused divisional business strategy to better position the segment for growth in coming years. In addition, a program was launched to capture growth opportunities, improve manufacturing cost
efficiency and reduce inventories. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $16 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

          In
September 2011, we announced plans to implement a significant restructuring of our Textile Effects segment, including the closure of our production facilities and business support
offices in Basel, Switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the Textile Effects segment's long-term global competitiveness. In connection with this plan and in connection
with revised estimates of site closure costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our Textile Effects segment

  recorded
charges of $8 million for non-cancelable long-term contract termination costs and $28 million for decommissioning associated with this initiative.   

          In
December 2014, we announced a comprehensive restructuring program to improve the global competitiveness of our Pigments and Additives segment. As part of the program, we are reducing
our workforce by approximately 900 positions. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of $4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

          In
March 2015, we announced plans to restructure our color pigments business, another step in our comprehensive restructuring program in our Pigments and Additives segment, and recorded
restructuring expense of approximately $12 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

          In
July 2016, we announced plans to close our Pigments and Additives segment's South African titanium dioxide manufacturing facility. As part of the program, we recorded restructuring
expense of approximately $5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $1 million during the second quarter of 2016.
The majority of the long-lived assets associated with this manufacturing facility were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2015.   

          In
connection with planned restructuring activities, our Pigments and Additives segment recorded accelerated depreciation as restructuring expense of $8 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.   

2015 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES     

          In June 2015, our Polyurethanes segment announced a restructuring program in Europe. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded
restructuring expense of $14 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related primarily to workforce reductions.   

          In
June 2015, our Advanced Materials segment initiated a restructuring program in Europe. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring expense of
$6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related primarily to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation recorded as restructuring, impairment and plant closing
costs.   

          In
September 2011, we announced plans to implement a significant restructuring of our Textile Effects segment, including the closure of our production facilities and business support
offices in Basel, Switzerland, as part of an ongoing strategic program aimed at improving the Textile Effects segment's long-term global competitiveness. In connection with this plan, during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, our Textile Effects segment recorded charges of $6 million for non-cancelable long-term contract termination costs, $4 million for decommissioning
and $2 million in other restructuring costs associated with this initiative. In addition, we recorded charges of $5 million associated with other initiatives.   

In
December 2014, we announced that we were taking significant action to improve the global competitiveness of our Pigments and Additives segment. As part of a comprehensive
restructuring program, we plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 900 positions. In connection with this restructuring program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our
Pigments and Additives segment recorded charges of $51 million for workforce reductions, $3 million for pension related charges and $12 million in other restructuring costs
associated with this initiative.

          In
February 2015, we announced a plan to close the 'black end' manufacturing operations and ancillary activities at our Calais, France site, which will reduce our titanium dioxide
capacity by approximately 100 kilotons, or 13% of our European titanium dioxide capacity. In connection with this announcement, we began to accelerate depreciation on the affected assets and recorded
accelerated depreciation in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $73 million as restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs. In addition, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we recorded charges of $21 million for workforce reductions and non-cash charges of $10 million.   

          In

6. DEBT (Continued)     

Huntsman International     

DIRECT AND SUBSIDIARY DEBT     

          Huntsman Corporation's direct debt and guarantee obligations consist of a guarantee of certain indebtedness incurred from time to time to
finance certain insurance premiums. Substantially all of our other debt, including the facilities described below, has been incurred by our subsidiaries (primarily Huntsman International). Huntsman
Corporation is not a guarantor of such subsidiary debt.   

          Certain
of our subsidiaries are designated as nonguarantor subsidiaries ("Nonguarantors") and have third-party debt agreements. These debt agreements contain certain restrictions with
regard to dividends, distributions, loans or advances. In certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to
us.   

Debt Issuance Costs     

          We record debt issuance costs related to a debt liability on the balance sheet as a reduction in the face amount of that debt liability. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amount of debt issuance costs directly reducing the debt liability was $60 million and $67 million, respectively. We record
the amortization of debt issuance costs as interest expense.   

Senior Credit Facilities     

          As of September 30, 2016, our senior credit facilities ("Senior Credit Facilities") consisted of our revolving credit facility

obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and certain of our foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Guarantors"), and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic property, plant and equipment, the stock of all of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign
subsidiaries, and pledges of intercompany notes between certain of our subsidiaries.   

          On
both July 22, 2016 and September 30, 2016, Huntsman International prepaid $100 million of its 2015 Extended Term Loan B. In connection with the
$200 million prepayments on our term loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1 million in the third quarter of 2016.   

Amendment to the Credit Agreement     

          On April 1, 2016, Huntsman International entered into a fifteenth amendment to the agreement governing the Senior Credit Facilities (the
"Credit Agreement"). The amendment provides for a new term loan facility, the 2016 Term Loan B, to refinance existing term loans pursuant to the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of
$550 million. The net proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan B were used to repay in full Huntsman International's extended term loan B due 2017, our extended term loan
B series 2 due 2017 and our term loan C due 2016 ("Term Loan C"). In connection with these repayments, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately
$2 million in the second quarter of 2016.

6. DEBT (Continued)    

          The
2016 Term Loan B matures on April 1, 2023, provided that the maturity date will accelerate if we do not repay, refinance or have a minimum level of liquidity available to
enable us to repay certain of our senior notes upon maturity. The 2016 Term Loan B is subject to the same terms and conditions as our existing senior secured term loan facilities.   

The
2016 Term Loan B bears interest at an interest rate margin of LIBOR plus 3.50% (subject to a 0.75% floor) and amortizes in annual amounts equal to 1% of the principal amount of the
2016 Term Loan B, payable quarterly commencing on June 30, 2016.   

          The
amendment also extends the stated termination date of our Revolving Facility from March 20, 2017 to March 20, 2021, provided that the maturity date will accelerate if
we do not repay, refinance or have a minimum level of liquidity available to enable us to repay our 2015 Extended Term Loan B due 2019 or our senior notes upon their maturity. The amendment further
increased the committed amount of our Revolving Facility by $25 million (from $625 million to $650 million). Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at the same rate
as the existing revolving commitments. As of September 30, 2016 we had no borrowings under our Revolving Facility.   

A/R Programs     

          Our U.S. accounts receivable securitization program ("U.S. A/R Program") and our European accounts receivable securitization program ("EU A/R
Program" and collectively with the U.S. A/R Program, "A/R Programs") are structured so that we transfer certain of our trade receivables to the U.S. special purpose entity ("U.S. SPE") and the
European special purpose entity ("EU SPE") in transactions intended to be true sales or true contributions. The receivables collateralize debt incurred by the U.S. SPE and the EU SPE. Information
regarding our A/R Programs as of September 30, 2016 was as follows (monetary amounts in millions):   

(1)    The
amount of actual availability under our A/R Programs may be lower based on the level of eligible receivables sold, changes in the credit ratings of our
customers, customer concentration levels and certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred, as defined in the applicable agreements.
      (2)    The
applicable rate for our U.S. A/R Program is defined by the lender as either USD LIBOR or CP rate. The applicable rate for our EU A/R Program is either GBP LIBOR,
USD LIBOR or EURIBOR. In addition, the U.S. SPE and the EU SPE are obligated to pay unused commitment fees to the lenders based on the amount of each lender's commitment.
      (3)    As
of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $7 million (U.S. dollar equivalents) of letters of credit issued and outstanding under our U.S. A/R
Program.

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $473 million and $438 million, respectively, of accounts receivable were pledged as collateral under our A/R
Programs.   

Redemption of Notes and Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt     

          During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we redeemed or repurchased the following notes (dollars in millions):   

Note Payable from Huntsman International to Huntsman Corporation     

          As of September 30, 2016, we had a loan of $796 million to our subsidiary, Huntsman International (the "Intercompany Note"). The
Intercompany Note is unsecured and $100 million of the outstanding amount is classified as current as of September 30, 2016 on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of
September 30, 2016, under the terms of the Intercompany Note, Huntsman International promises to pay us interest on the unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum based on the previous monthly
average borrowing rate obtained under our U.S. A/R Program, less 10 basis points (provided that the rate shall not exceed an amount that is 25 basis points less than
the monthly average borrowing rate obtained for the U.S. LIBOR-based borrowings under our Revolving Facility).   

COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS     

We believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including our
Senior Credit Facilities, our A/R Programs and our notes.   

          Our
material financing arrangements contain certain covenants with which we must comply. A failure to comply with a covenant could result in a default under a financing arrangement
unless we obtained an appropriate waiver or forbearance (as to which we can provide no assurance). A default under these material financing arrangements generally allows debt holders the option to
declare the underlying debt obligations immediately due and payable. Furthermore, certain of our material financing arrangements contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions under which a
failure to comply with the covenants in one financing arrangement may result in an event of default under another financing arrangement.   

          Our
Senior Credit Facilities are subject to a single financial covenant (the "Leverage Covenant"), which applies only to the Revolving Facility and is calculated at the Huntsman
International level. The Leverage Covenant is applicable only if borrowings, letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the Revolving Facility (cash collateralized letters of credit or
guarantees are not deemed outstanding). The Leverage Covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant, which requires

    HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES    

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    

6. DEBT (Continued)    

  that
Huntsman International's ratio of senior secured debt to EBITDA (as defined in the applicable agreement) is not more than 3.75 to 1.   

          If
in the future Huntsman International fails to comply with the Leverage Covenant, then we may not have access to liquidity under our Revolving Facility. If Huntsman International
failed to comply with the Leverage Covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Facility, Huntsman International would be in default under
the Senior Credit Facilities, and, unless Huntsman International obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default (as to which we can provide no assurance), Huntsman International could
be required to pay
off the balance of the Senior Credit Facilities in full, and we may not have further access to such facilities.   

          The
agreements governing our A/R Programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. Any material failure to meet the applicable A/R Programs' metrics in the future could lead
to an early termination event under the A/R Programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the
discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the A/R Programs in full. An early termination event under the A/R Programs would also constitute an event of default under our Senior Credit
Facilities, which could require us to pay off the balance of the Senior Credit Facilities in full and could result in the loss of our Senior Credit Facilities.   

7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES     

We are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. From time to time, we enter into transactions, including
transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures.   

          All
derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes
in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. To the extent applicable, we perform effectiveness
assessments in order to use hedge accounting at each reporting period. For a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.   

          We
also hedge our net investment in certain European operations. Changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain European operations are recorded as an unrealized
currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss.   

          Our
revenues and expenses are denominated in various foreign currencies, and our cash flows and earnings are thus subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variations. From time to
time, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. Where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash
balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. Certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally
through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of one year or less). We do not

  hedge
our foreign currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately
$176 million in notional amount (in U.S. dollar equivalents) outstanding in forward foreign currency contracts.   

          Huntsman
International has entered into two interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in LIBOR under our Senior
Credit Facilities. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in
millions):   

Beginning
in 2009, Arabian Amines Company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of LIBOR interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%.
In connection with the consolidation of Arabian Amines Company as of July 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. See "Note 4. Variable Interest
Entities." The notional amount of the swap as of September 30, 2016 was $20 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge. As of September 30,
2016, the fair value of the swap was $2 million and was recorded in noncurrent liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For each of the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of nil due to changes in fair value of the swap.   

          In
November 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional  161 million. This swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. Under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed U.S. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on May 15 and November 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately  3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of this swap was $21 million
and was recorded in noncurrent assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.   

          In
March 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
 255 million. This swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we terminated these
cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million in payments from the counterparties.   

A
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. We also finance certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. We manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as

  permanent
loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges.   

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on our condensed statements of comprehensive income (loss). From time to time, we review
such designation of intercompany loans.   

          We
review our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. As of September 30, 2016, we have designated
approximately  671 million (approximately $754 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the amount of loss recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $11 million and $18 million, respectively, and was recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss) on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).   

8. FAIR VALUE     

The fair values of financial instruments were as follows (dollars in millions):   

The
carrying amounts reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the
immediate
or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of non-qualified employee benefit plan investments and investments in equity securities are obtained through market observable
pricing using prevailing market prices. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt are based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market
(Level 1).   

          The
fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The estimated fair
value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2016 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the
amounts presented herein.

8. FAIR VALUE (Continued)    

(2)    The
income approach is used to calculate the fair value of these instruments. Fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows, calculated
using relevant interest rates, exchange rates, and yield curves at stated intervals. There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine the fair value during the
current period.   

In
November 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract. These instruments have been categorized by us as
Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs associated with the credit valuation adjustment, which we deemed to be significant inputs to the overall measurement of fair
value at inception.    

   (3)    The
income approach is used to calculate the fair value of these instruments. Fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows, calculated
using relevant interest rates and yield curves at stated intervals. There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine the fair value during the current period.
      (4)    There
were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 within the fair value hierarchy for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015.

more is determined to be impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded charges of $1 million and nil, respectively, for the impairment of long-lived
assets.

Corporation common stock. Repurchases under this program may be made through open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs or by other
means. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including market conditions. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and
repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued from time

time without prior notice. On October 27, 2015, we entered into and funded an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $100 million of our common stock that was completed
in January 2016 with the purchase of 8.6 million shares. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock under the
repurchase program. As of September 30, 2016, there remained approximately $50 million of the amount authorized under the program that can be used for repurchases.   

COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS     

          During each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we paid dividends of
$30 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders and during each of the quarters ended September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends
of $31 million, or $0.125 per share, to common stockholders.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES     

LEGAL MATTERS     

Antitrust Matters     

          We were named as a defendant in consolidated class action civil antitrust suits filed on February 9 and 12, 2010 in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Maryland alleging that we, our co-defendants and other alleged co-conspirators conspired to fix prices of TiO 2  sold in the U.S. between at least March 1,
2002 and the present. The other defendants named in this matter were DuPont, Kronos and Cristal (formerly Millennium). On August 28, 2012, the court certified a class consisting of all U.S.
customers who purchased TiO 2  directly from the defendants (the "Direct Purchasers") since February 1, 2003. On December 13, 2013, we and all other defendants settled the
Direct Purchasers litigation and the court approved the settlement. We paid the settlement in an amount immaterial to our financial statements.   

          On
November 22, 2013, we were named as a defendant in a civil antitrust suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota brought by a Direct Purchaser who opted
out of the Direct Purchasers class litigation (the "Opt-Out Litigation"). On April 21, 2014, the court severed the claims against us from the other defendants sued and ordered our case
transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Subsequently, Kronos, another defendant, was also severed from the Minnesota case and claims against it were transferred and
consolidated for trial with our case in the Southern District of Texas. On February 26, 2016, we reached an agreement to settle the Opt-Out Litigation and subsequently paid the settlement in an
amount immaterial to our financial statements.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)    

          We
were also named as a defendant in a class action civil antitrust suit filed on March 15, 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by the
purchasers of products made from TiO 2  (the "Indirect Purchasers") making essentially the same allegations as did the Direct Purchasers. On October 14, 2014, plaintiffs filed their
Second Amended Class Action Complaint narrowing the class of plaintiffs to those merchants and consumers of architectural coatings containing TiO 2 . On August 11, 2015, the court
granted our motion to dismiss the Indirect Purchasers litigation with leave to amend the complaint. A Third Amended Class Action Complaint was filed on September 29, 2015 further limiting the
class to consumers of architectural paints. Plaintiffs have raised state antitrust claims under the laws of 15 states, consumer protection claims under the laws of nine states, and unjust enrichment
claims under the laws of 16 states. On November 4, 2015, we and our co-defendants filed another motion to dismiss. On June 13, 2016, the court substantially denied the motion to dismiss
except as to consumer protection claims in one state.   

          On
August 23, 2016, we were named as a defendant in a fourth civil antitrust suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by an Indirect
Purchaser, Home Depot. Home Depot is an Indirect Purchaser primarily through paints it purchasers from various manufacturers. Home Depot makes the same claims as the Direct and Indirect Purchasers.   

The
plaintiffs in the Indirect Purchasers claims seek to recover injunctive relief, treble damages or the maximum damages allowed by state law, costs of suit and attorneys' fees. We are
not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees. Nevertheless, we have incurred costs relating to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts which in the aggregate could
be material to us. Because of the overall complexity of these cases, we are unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss and we have made no accrual with respect to these claims.   

Product Delivery Claim     

          We have been notified by a customer of potential claims related to our alleged delivery of a different product than the one the customer had
ordered. Our customer claims that it was unaware that the different product had been delivered until after that product had been used to manufacture materials which were subsequently sold. Originally,
the customer stated that it had been notified of claims by its customers of up to an aggregate of  153 million (approximately $172 million) relating to this matter and
claimed that we may be responsible for all or a portion of these potential claims. Our customer has since resolved some of these claims and the aggregate amount of the current claims is now
approximately  113 million (approximately $127 million). Based on the facts currently available, we believe that we are insured for any liability we may ultimately have
in excess of $10 million. However, no assurance can be given regarding our ultimate liability or costs. We believe our range of possible loss in this matter is between  0 and
 113 million (approximately $127 million), and we have made no accrual with respect to this matter.   

Indemnification Matters     

          On July 3, 2012, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ("the Banks") demanded that we
indemnify them for claims brought against them by certain MatlinPatterson entities that were formerly our stockholders ("MatlinPatterson") in litigation filed by MatlinPatterson on June 19,
2012 in the 9th District Court in Montgomery County, Texas (the "Texas Litigation").

  These
claims allegedly arose from the failed acquisition by and merger with Hexion. The Texas Litigation was dismissed, which was upheld by the Ninth Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court
denied review by final order entered January 7, 2016.   

          On
July 14, 2014, the Banks demanded that we indemnify them for additional claims brought against them by certain other former Company stockholders in litigation filed
June 14, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (the "Wisconsin Litigation"). The stockholders in the Wisconsin Litigation have made essentially the same
factual allegations as
MatlinPatterson made in the Texas Litigation and, additionally, have named Apollo Global Management LLC and Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. as defendants. Stockholder plaintiffs in the
Wisconsin Litigation assert claims for misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. On June 30, 2016, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the Apollo defendants and filed responses to the
Banks' previously filed motions to dismiss, which remain pending. We denied the Banks' indemnification demand for both the Texas Litigation and the Wisconsin Litigation.   

Other Proceedings     

          We are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under provisions of
applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. Except as otherwise disclosed in this report, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters will have
a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.   

13. ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS     

EHS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES     

          We may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under EHS laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair
pollution control equipment. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our capital expenditures for EHS matters totaled $40 million and $92 million, respectively. Because capital expenditures for these
matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements, our capital expenditures for EHS matters have varied
significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts we may spend related to EHS and other applicable laws.   

ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES     

          We have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties.
Liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimates are calculated using present value techniques as
appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. The environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as
asset retirement obligations. We had accrued $37 million and $38 million for environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of
these amounts, $2 million and $6 million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated

  balance
sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and $35 million and $32 million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheets for September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In certain cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to
30 years. We may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess.   

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS     

          Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state laws, a current or former owner or
operator of real property in the U.S. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and
a current owner or operator may be
liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in France and Australia, can
hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. Currently, there are approximately 10 former facilities or third-party sites in the U.S. for which we have been notified
of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA. Based on current information and past experiences at other CERCLA sites, we do not
expect these third-party claims to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

          Under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") in the U.S. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition
to our hazardous waste permit. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil,
groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. For example, our Port Neches, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana,
facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under RCRA. Similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing
facilities, such as Australia, India, France, Hungary and Italy.   

West Footscray Remediation     

          By letter dated March 7, 2006, our former Base Chemicals and Polymers facility in West Footscray, Australia was issued a cleanup notice
by the Environmental Protection Authority Victoria ("EPA Victoria") due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site. On August 23, 2010, EPA Victoria revoked a
second cleanup notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accrued liability of approximately
$17 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site. We can provide no assurance that the authority will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or
that additional costs will not be required for the cleanup.

North Maybe Mine Remediation     

          The North Maybe Canyon Mine site is a CERCLA site and involves a former phosphorous mine near Soda Springs, Idaho, which is believed to have
been operated by several companies, including a predecessor company to us. In 2004, the U.S. Forest Service notified us that we are a CERCLA potentially responsible party ("PRP") for contamination
originating from the site. In February 2010, we and Wells Cargo (another PRP) agreed to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study of a portion of the site and are currently engaged in that
process. At this time, we are unable to reasonably estimate our potential liabilities at this site.   

Port Neches Flaring Matter     

          As part of the Environmental Protection Agency's (the "EPA") national enforcement initiative on flaring operations and by letter dated
October 12, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") notified us that we were in violation of the Clear Air Act ("CAA") based on our response to a 2010 CAA Section 114
Information Request. The EPA has used the enforcement initiative to bring similar actions against refiners and other chemical manufacturers and has sought to collect civil penalties in excess of
$100,000. Specifically, the EPA alleged violations at our Port Neches, Texas facility from 2007-2012 for flare operations not consistent with good pollution control practice and not in compliance with
certain flare-related regulations. As a result of these findings, the EPA referred this matter to the DOJ. We provided a formal response to the DOJ and the EPA with a supplemental data submission on
April 29, 2013. We have been engaged in discussions with the DOJ and the EPA regarding these alleged violations and conducted field trials on an alternate flare monitoring method beginning in
September 2014. We are currently unable to determine the likelihood or magnitude of any potential penalty or injunctive relief that may be incurred in resolving this matter.   

14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS     

On May 5, 2016, our stockholders approved a new Huntsman Corporation 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2016 Stock Incentive Plan"), which reserved 8.2 million shares for
issuance. The Huntsman Corporation Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "Prior Plan"), remains in effect for outstanding awards granted pursuant to the Prior Plan, but no further awards
may be granted under the Prior Plan. Under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan we may grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom stock,
performance share units and other stock-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, provided that incentive stock options may be
granted solely to employees. The terms of the grants under both the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan are fixed at the grant date. As of September 30, 2016, we were authorized to
grant up to 8.2 million shares under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 8 million shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan
available for grant. Option awards have a maximum contractual term of 10 years and generally must have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of our common stock on the date the
option award is granted. Outstanding stock-based awards generally vest over a three-year period; certain performance share unit awards vest over a two-year period.

14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued)     

The compensation cost from continuing operations under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan for our Company and Huntsman International were as follows (dollars in millions):   

The
total income tax benefit recognized in the statements of operations for us and Huntsman International for stock-based compensation arrangements was $5 million each for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

STOCK OPTIONS     

          The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. The expected term of options granted was estimated based on the
contractual term of the instruments and employees' expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The assumptions noted below represent the weighted average of the assumptions utilized for stock options granted during the
periods.

14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued)    

A
summary of stock option activity under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months then ended is presented
below:   

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.03 per option. As of September 30, 2016, there
was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option arrangements granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan. That cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years.   

          The
total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended both September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately nil.   

NONVESTED SHARES     

          Nonvested shares granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan consist of restricted stock and performance share unit awards,
which are accounted for as equity awards, and phantom stock, which is accounted for as a liability award because it can be settled in either stock or cash.   

The
fair value of each performance share unit award is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses various assumptions, including an expected volatility rate and a risk-free
interest rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted-average expected volatility rate was 39.3% and 30.0%, respectively and the weighted average risk-free interest
rate was 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. For the performance share unit awards granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the number of shares earned varies based upon the
Company achieving certain performance criteria over two-year and three-year performance periods. The performance criteria are total stockholder return of our common stock relative to the total
stockholder return of a specified industry peer group for the two-year and three-year performance periods.

14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued)    

          A
summary of the status of our nonvested shares as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months then ended is presented below:   

(1)    As
of September 30, 2016, a total of 454,900 restricted stock units were vested but not yet issued, of which 60,948 vested during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. These shares have not been reflected as vested shares in this table because, in accordance with the restricted stock unit agreements, shares of common stock are not issued
for vested restricted stock units until termination of employment.     

As
of September 30, 2016, there was $32 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share compensation arrangements granted under the 2016 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Prior Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. The value of share awards that vested during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $15 million and $20 million, respectively.   

15. INCOME TAXES     

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. We evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Valuation allowances are reviewed
on an individual tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
These conclusions require significant judgment. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider the cyclicality of our businesses and cumulative income or losses
during the applicable period. Cumulative losses incurred over the applicable period limits our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for the future. Changes in expected
future income in applicable jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, for unrecognized tax benefits that impact tax expense, we recorded a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits and a
corresponding income tax
benefit of $6 million and a net decrease in unrecognized benefits and a corresponding income tax benefit of $5 million, respectively. Additional increases and decreases in unrecognized
tax

were offset by cash settlements or decreases in net deferred tax assets and, therefore, did not affect income tax expense.   

Huntsman Corporation     

          We recorded income tax expense of $58 million and $85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax
jurisdictions. Notably, we continue to earn a significant portion of our pre-tax income in the United States with an approximate 35% federal and state blended effective tax rate. Our MTBE earnings are
taxed at the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. Variability in our MTBE earnings has a meaningful impact on our effective tax rate. The combination of significantly lower MTBE earnings, weather related and
other production outages in the U.S., and higher earnings in countries with valuation allowances, resulted in an unusually low effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016.   

Huntsman International     

          Huntsman International recorded income tax expense of $58 million and $85 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances

16. NET INCOME PER SHARE     

Basic income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing net income available to Huntsman
Corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive
securities.

16. NET INCOME PER SHARE (Continued)    

          Basic
and diluted income per share is determined using the following information (in millions):   

Additional
stock-based awards of 5.5 million and 7.0 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and 5.9 million and 2.7 million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. However, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because the
effect would be anti-dilutive.   

17. OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION     

We derive our revenues, earnings and cash flows from the manufacture and sale of a wide variety of differentiated and commodity chemical products. We have reported our operations through
five segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials, Textile Effects and Pigments and Additives. We have organized our business and derived our operating segments around differences
in product lines.

(1)    Beginning
in the second quarter of 2016, we use segment adjusted EBITDA as the measure of each segment's profit or loss. We believe that segment adjusted EBITDA more
accurately reflects what management uses to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their financial performance. We have recasted the measure of each segment's profit
or loss in the prior periods disclosed to reflect segment adjusted EBITDA.     

Segment
adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests and certain Corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition, integration and separation expenses;
(b) EBITDA from discontinued operations; (c) gain (loss) on disposition of businesses/assets; (d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain legal settlements and
related expenses;

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS            

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     

          With respect to Huntsman Corporation, certain information set forth in this report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning the
Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than historical factual information are
forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenue, expenses, profit, profit margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit
obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position or other projected financial measures; management's plans and strategies for future operations, including statements relating to
anticipated operating performance, cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, or
other distributions, strategic opportunities, securities offerings, stock repurchases, dividends and executive compensation; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified
laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in
those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or
developments that we intend or believe will or may occur in the future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will,"
"should," "anticipates" or "intends" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make additional forward-looking statements from time to
time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.   

All
forward-looking statements, including without limitation management's examination of historical operating trends, are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our
expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and

because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable law.   

There
are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this report.
Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks set forth in "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors" below, "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our
Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

OVERVIEW     

Business     

          We operate in five segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials, Textile Effects and Pigments and Additives. Our products
comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. Our products are used in a wide range of applications,
including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, personal care and hygiene, durable and non-durable consumer products, digital inks, electronics, medical, packaging,
paints and coatings, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dye industries. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including MDI, amines,
surfactants, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer   

  65  

Table of Contents   

  formulations,
textile chemicals, dyes, titanium dioxide and color pigments. Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $7,262 million and
$7,967 million, respectively.   

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS     

Separation of our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects Businesses     

          In connection with our previously announced plans to separate our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses through a U.S. tax-free
spin-off to our stockholders, on October 28, 2016, SpinCo filed an initial registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC. Subject to market conditions, we expect the spin-off to be
completed in the first half of 2017.   

Sale of European Surfactants Manufacturing Facilities     

          On August 3, 2016, we announced that Innospec had committed to purchase our European surfactants business for an enterprise value of
$225 million pursuant to the terms of an Exclusivity and Put Option Agreement under which we could, by notice to Innospec, exercise an option to enter into an agreed form SAPA with Innospec. We
have provided that notice and, as of October 25, 2016, we and Innospec have each signed the SAPA and an amendment thereto. Under the terms of the transaction, Innospec will acquire our
manufacturing facilities located in Saint-Mihiel, France; Castiglione delle Stiviere, Italy; and Barcelona, Spain. The $225 million enterprise value includes our related trade receivables and
payables, which we will retain. The purchase price will be subject to additional working capital and other adjustments. Closing is expected to occur by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and is
subject to customary conditions. We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale to repay debt. The assets and liabilities of this business are included in our Performance Products segment and are
classified as held for sale on the accompanying balance sheets.   

          Upon
consummating the planned transaction, we will enter into supply and long-term tolling arrangements with Innospec in order to continue marketing certain core products strategic to
our global agrochemicals, lubes and certain other businesses.   

OUTLOOK     

          Our third quarter 2016 results reflect our continued focus on three strategic priorities: first, generating free cash flow of more than
$350 million in 2016; second, growing margins and earnings in our core downstream differentiated businesses; and third, separating our titanium dioxide business.   

We
believe that we are well positioned to accomplish these objectives. With increased discipline related to capital expenditures and working capital management, we generated significant
free cash flow in the third quarter, enabling us to prepay $200 million of our debt. We are experiencing increased sales volumes and improving margins in our MDI urethanes business, stable
margins in the key businesses in our Performance Products segment and steadily improving margins in our Advanced Materials and Textile Effects segments. Our focus on growing margins and earnings
resulted in strong earnings during the third quarter, notwithstanding weather related and other production outages.   

On
October 28, 2016, we filed an initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC as part of the process to spin off our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects
businesses. We are experiencing improved business conditions and increased selling prices for titanium dioxide within the Pigments and
Additives segment and we believe we will be well positioned for a separation in the first half of 2017. Our ability to effect the spin-off is subject to, among other things, market conditions and the
approval of our Board of Directors.

In
2016 and 2017, we expect to spend approximately $450 million and $400 million on capital expenditures, respectively.   

          We
expect our 2016 and 2017 adjusted effective tax rates to be approximately 25%-30%, with variability primarily conditioned on earnings within the U.S. Our MTBE earnings are
taxed at the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, and variability in our MTBE earnings has a meaningful impact on our adjusted effective tax rate. We expect our long term adjusted effective tax rate to be
approximately 30%.

(1)    Our
management uses adjusted EBITDA to assess financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as
appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain Corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following
adjustments: (a) business acquisition, integration and separation expenses; (b) EBITDA from discontinued operations; (c) (gain) loss on disposition of businesses/assets;
(d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (f) amortization of    
  72

pension
and postretirement actuarial losses; (g) net plant incident remediation costs (credits); and (h) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. We believe that
net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable
to adjusted EBITDA.    

  We
believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing the businesses' ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items
that management believes are not indicative of the businesses' operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in
isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our
management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities
analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry.
For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly
among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various
jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize
different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among
companies.    

  Nevertheless,
our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of our Company as compared to net income of Huntsman
Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. For example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and interest expense is a
necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to
provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.    

  In
addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is
useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific
underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in
future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or
future results.    

(2)    Adjusted
net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman
International, as appropriate: (a) business acquisition, integration and separation expenses; (b) loss from discontinued operations; (c) (gain) loss on disposition of
businesses/assets; (d) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (e) certain legal settlements and related (income) expenses; (f) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial
losses; (g) net plant incident remediation costs (credits); and    
  73  

Table of Contents   

(h) restructuring,
impairment and plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing
adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities.
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information.    

(3)    The
income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total
adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it
provides more meaningful information than is provided under GAAP.
      (4)    Includes
costs associated with transition activities relating to the migration of our information system data centers and the transition of our Textile Effects
segment's production from Basel, Switzerland to a tolling facility. These transition costs were included in either selling, general and administrative expenses or cost of sales on our condensed
consolidated statements of operations.
      (5)    Capital
expenditures, net of reimbursements, represent cash paid for capital expenditures less payments received as reimbursements from customers and joint venture
partners. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures of $290 million and $454 million, respectively, were reimbursed in part by
$28 million and $11 million, respectively.
      (6)    Management
internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate the Company's liquidity, (b) to evaluate strategic investments, (c) to plan
stock buyback and dividend levels, and (d) to evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be
inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operating activities and used in investing
activities, excluding merger and acquisition/disposition activities. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the Company's condensed consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be
adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.    

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     

          For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation was $55 million on revenues of
$2,363 million, compared with net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation of $55 million on revenues of $2,638 million for the same period of 2015. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 net income attributable to Huntsman International was $54 million on revenues of $2,363 million, compared with net income attributable to Huntsman International
of $56 million on revenues of $2,638 million for the same period of 2015. The unchanged net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation and the decrease of $2 million in net
income attributable to Huntsman International was the result of the following items:  

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $275 million, or 10%, as compared with the 2015 period. The
decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices in all our segments and lower sales volumes in our Polyurethanes, Performance Products and Advanced Materials segments. See
" Segment Analysis" below.   
            Our gross profit and the gross profit of Huntsman International for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by
$75 million each, or 16% each, as compared with the 2015    
 
  74

period.
The decrease resulted from lower gross margins in our Polyurethanes, Performance Products and Pigments and Additives segments. See " Segment Analysis" below.   

Our operating expenses and the operating expenses of Huntsman International for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by
$55 million each, or 19%, as compared with the 2015 period, primarily related to a decrease in acquisition expenses, the impact of translating foreign currency amounts to the U.S. dollar, lower
foreign currency transaction losses and a gain associated with the sale of a business within our Pigments and Additives segment.   
            Restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $45 million from
$14 million in the 2015 period. For more information concerning restructuring activities, see "Note 5. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing Costs" to our condensed consolidated
financial statements.   
            Loss on early extinguishment of debt for three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $1 million from $8 million in
the 2015 period. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million related to the redemption of the remainder of our
senior subordinated notes due 2021.   
            Our income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to an income tax benefit of $1 million from an
income tax expense of $49 million in the 2015 period. The income tax expense of Huntsman International for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to nil from
$48 million in the 2015 period. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation
allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. For further information concerning taxes, see "Note 15. Income Taxes" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Polyurethanes      

          The decrease in revenues in our Polyurethanes segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015
was primarily due to lower average selling prices and lower MTBE sales volumes, partially offset by higher MDI sales volumes. MDI average selling prices decreased in response to lower raw material
costs. MTBE average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of lower pricing for high octane gasoline. MTBE sales volumes decreased primarily due to the impact of weather related and other
production outages. MDI sales volumes increased due to higher demand in the Americas and European regions. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower MTBE margins and the
impact of weather related and other production outages estimated at approximately $15 million, partially offset by higher MDI margins and sales volumes.   

Performance Products      

          The decrease in revenues in our Performance Products segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of
2015 was due to lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes. Average selling prices decreased primarily in response to lower raw material costs and competitive market conditions. Sales
volumes decreased primarily due to the impact of weather related and other production outages, softer demand in China and oilfield applications as well as competitive market conditions. The decrease
in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the impact of weather related and other production outages estimated at approximately $10 million as well as lower margins in our amines, maleic
anhydride and upstream intermediates businesses.   

Advanced Materials      

          The decrease in revenues in our Advanced Materials segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of
2015 was due to lower sales volumes and lower average selling prices. Sales volumes decreased primarily due to soft demand for low value business in our coatings and construction and wind markets,
partially offset by global growth in our aerospace and electronic markets. Average selling prices decreased in our Asia Pacific region primarily as a result of competitive pressure in our electrical,
electronic and wind markets, partially offset by higher average selling prices in our European and Americas regions. Segment adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat as lower sales volumes and lower
margins were mostly offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs.

Textile Effects      

          The decrease in revenues in our Textile Effects segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015
was due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs and the foreign currency exchange impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar against major international currencies. Sales volumes increased in key target countries, mainly in South Asia. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to
higher margins from lower raw material costs as well as lower selling, general and administrative costs.   

Pigments and Additives      

          The decrease in revenues in our Pigments and Additives segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 was due to lower average selling prices. Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of competitive pressure; however, they increased compared to the prior quarter. Sales volumes
were unchanged as increased end use demand for our titanium dioxide products was offset by seasonally lower volumes for our additives products. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily
due to higher margins resulting from restructuring savings.   

Corporate and other      

          Corporate and other includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign exchange gains and losses, LIFO inventory valuation reserve
adjustments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, unallocated restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs, nonoperating income and expense, benzene sales and gains and losses on the disposition
of corporate assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other for Huntsman Corporation increased by $5 million to a loss of
$45 million from a loss of $50 million for the same period in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other for Huntsman
International increased by $5 million to a loss of $44 million from a loss of $49 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other
resulted primarily from an increase in unallocated foreign currency exchange gain and an increase in income from benzene sales, partially offset by a decrease in LIFO inventory valuation income and an
increase in unallocated corporate overhead.   

Discontinued Operations      

          The operating results of our former polymers, base chemicals and Australian styrenics businesses are classified as discontinued operations, and,
accordingly, the revenues of these businesses are excluded from revenues for all periods presented. The adjusted EBITDA of these former businesses are included in discontinued operations for all
periods presented. The loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results, legal costs, restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs and gain (loss) on disposal with respect to
our former businesses.

financial statements.   
            Loss on early extinguishment of debt for nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $3 million from $31 million in
the 2015 period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million primarily related to the redemption of our senior
subordinated notes due 2021.   
            Our income tax expense and the income tax expense of Huntsman International for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to
$58 million from $85 million in the 2015 period. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by
the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. For further information concerning taxes, see "Note 15. Income Taxes" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to increased operating income as described in " Results
of Operations" above as well as a $359 million favorable variance in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the same period of
2015.   

          Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $270 million and $383 million, respectively. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid $290 million and $454 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we made investments in Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. of $23 million and $26 million, respectively, and in our BASF Huntsman Shanghai Isocyanate Investment B.V. joint
venture of nil and $12 million, respectively, and received dividends from Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. of $25 million and $33 million, respectively. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid nil and $14 million, respectively, for the acquisition of businesses and received proceeds from a purchase price adjustment of nil and
$18 million, respectively, related to our acquisition of the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we received $66 million from the termination of cross-currency interest rate contracts.   

          Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $397 million and $418 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash
used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in repayments of long-term debt during the 2016 period as
compared to the 2015 period. On April 1, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Term Loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million. Additionally, on April 1, 2016, we used the
net proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan B to repay in full our extended term loan B due 2017, extended term loan B series 2 due 2017 and our Term Loan C. On both July 22, 2016 and
September 30, 2016, we prepaid $100 million of our Extended Term Loan B. On March 31, 2015, we issued  300 million (approximately $326 million)
aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes. On April 17, 2015, we used the net proceeds of this offering to redeem $289 million ($294 million carrying value) of our senior
subordinated notes due 2021 and redeemed the remaining $195 million ($198 million carrying value) of our senior subordinated notes due 2021 during the third quarter of 2015.   

          Free
cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were cash proceeds of $569 million and use of cash of $1 million, respectively. The improvement
in free cash flow was attributable to the changes in cash flows from operating and investing activities, excluding merger and acquisition activities.

Changes in Financial Condition     

          The following information summarizes our working capital position (dollars in millions):   

Our
working capital increased by $77 million as a result of the net impact of the following significant changes:  

The increase in cash and cash equivalents of $182 million resulted from the matters identified on our condensed consolidated statements
of cash flows.   
            Accounts and notes receivable increased by $17 million mainly due to higher revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.   
            Inventories decreased by $248 million primarily due to lower inventory volumes and lower inventory costs.    
            Prepaid expenses decreased by $37 million mainly due to the distribution of employee termination and other restructuring costs that were
prefunded during the fourth quarter of 2015.   
            Accounts payable decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower purchases consistent with the lower inventory balances noted above.    
            Accrued liabilities decreased by $31 million primarily due to the distribution of prefunded restructuring costs.    
            Current portion of debt decreased by $82 million primarily due to the repayment of our Term Loan C during the second quarter of 2016. On
April 1, 2016, this debt was refinanced with the 2016 Term Loan B. Additionally, on both July 22, 2016 and September 30, 2016, Huntsman International prepaid $100 million
of its 2015 Extended Term Loan B. See "Note 6. Debt Direct and Subsidiary Debt" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
            Current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale as of September 30, 2016 represent the assets and liabilities of our
European surfactants business included in the planned transaction with Innospec.

LIQUIDITY     

          We depend upon our cash, credit facilities, A/R Programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working capital
needs. As of September 30, 2016, we had $1,247 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of $450 million in cash and restricted cash, $633 million
in availability under our Revolving Facility, and $164 million in availability under our A/R Programs. Our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. The following matters had,
or are expected to have, a significant impact on our liquidity:  

Cash from our accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable, increased by approximately $224 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We expect volatility in our working capital components to continue.    
            During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $450 million on capital expenditures. Our future expenditures include certain EHS
maintenance and upgrades; and periodic maintenance and    
 
  85  

Table of Contents   

repairs
applicable to major units of manufacturing facilities. We expect to fund this spending with cash provided by operations.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans of
$54 million. During 2016, we expect to contribute an additional amount of approximately $20 million to these plans.   
            We are involved in a number of cost reduction programs for which we have established restructuring accruals. As of September 30, 2016,
we had $118 million of accrued restructuring costs from continuing operations, of which $68 million is classified as current. For further discussion of these plans and the costs
involved, see "Note 5. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing costs" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
            The payment of dividends is a business decision made by our Board of Directors from time to time based on our earnings, financial position and
prospects, and such other considerations as our Board of Directors considers relevant. Historically, our Board of Directors has declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per share of common stock.
While management currently expects that the Company will continue to pay the quarterly cash dividend, its dividend practice may change at any time.   
            On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized our Company to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common
stock. On October 27, 2015, we entered into and funded an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $100 million of our common stock that was completed in January 2016 with
the purchase of 8.6 million shares. We have $50 million remaining that is available under this authorization that is available to be used to purchase additional shares. For more
information, see "Note. 10. Huntsman Corporation Stockholders' Equity Share Repurchase Program" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
            On August 3, 2016, we announced that Innospec had committed to purchase our European surfactants business for an enterprise value of
$225 million pursuant to the terms of an Exclusivity and Put Option Agreement under which we could, by notice to Innospec, exercise an option to enter into an agreed form SAPA with Innospec. We
have provided that notice and, as of October 25, 2016, we and Innospec have each signed the SAPA and an amendment thereto. Under the terms of the transaction, Innospec will acquire our
manufacturing facilities located in Saint-Mihiel, France; Castiglione delle Stiviere, Italy; and Barcelona, Spain. The $225 million enterprise value includes our related trade receivables and
payables, which we will retain. The purchase price will be subject to additional working capital and other adjustments. Closing is expected to occur by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and is
subject to customary conditions. We expect to use the net proceeds from the sale to repay debt. The assets and liabilities of this business are included in our Performance Products segment and are
classified as held for sale on the accompanying balance sheets. For more information, see "Note 1. General Recent Developments Sale of European Surfactants Manufacturing
Facilities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
            In connection with the spin-off of our Pigments and Additives and Textile Effects businesses into a separate, publicly traded company, which we
refer to as "SpinCo," we anticipate that SpinCo will enter into new financing arrangements in anticipation of the spin-off. After SpinCo has entered into its new financing arrangements but immediately
prior to separation, it will make a cash distribution to Huntsman International and, at separation, SpinCo will assume various Huntsman International indebtedness. We anticipate that SpinCo will fund
such cash distribution and will repay such assumed indebtedness with the proceeds of its new financing arrangement. In connection with the spin-off, we expect to incur various significant one-time
costs associated with the spin-off in the coming periods.

On both July 22, 2016 and September 30, 2016, Huntsman International prepaid $100 million of the 2015 Extended Term Loan
B. In connection with the $200 million prepayments on our term loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. See "Note 6.
Debt Direct and Subsidiary Debt Senior Credit Facilities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements.    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $88 million classified as current portion of debt, including a short-term borrowing facility in China totaling $12 million,
scheduled Senior Credit Facilities amortization payments totaling $18 million, debt at our variable interest entities of $20 million, and certain other short-term facilities and
scheduled amortization payments totaling $38 million. Although we cannot provide assurances, we intend to renew, repay or extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the next twelve
months.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $343 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our
variable interest entities. Additionally, we have material intercompany debt obligations owed to us by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our
local operations. Nevertheless, we could repatriate cash as dividends or as repayments of intercompany debt. If foreign cash were repatriated as dividends, the dividends could be subject to U.S.
federal and state income taxes without any offsetting foreign tax credit relief. At present, we estimate that we will generate sufficient cash in our U.S. operations, together with the payments of
intercompany debt if necessary, to meet our cash needs in the U.S and we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. as dividends. Cash held by certain foreign subsidiaries, including our variable
interest entities, may also be subject to legal restrictions, including those arising from the interests of our partners, which could limit the amounts available for repatriation.   

CAPITAL RESOURCES     

          We are now commissioning a new production facility in Augusta, Georgia for the synthesis of iron oxide pigments, which we purchased from
Rockwood Holdings, Inc. During commissioning, the facility has experienced delays producing products at the expected specifications and quantities, causing us to question the capabilities of
the Augusta technology. Based on the facility's performance during the commissioning process, we have concluded that production capacity at our Augusta facility will be substantially lower than
originally anticipated.   

RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND PLANT CLOSING COSTS     

          Since our acquisition of the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., our Pigments and Additives
segment has been involved in a cost reduction program expected to reduce costs by approximately $140 million and improve its global competitiveness. In addition, we have announced a capacity
reduction at our titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in Calais, France expected to generate approximately $35 million of annual savings. The cost savings from this cost reduction program
were achieved during the first half of 2016.   

          For
further discussion of these and other restructuring plans and the costs involved, see "Note 5. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing Costs" to our condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Our critical accounting policies are presented in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            

          We are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks. From time to time, we
enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures.   

All
derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes
in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged items are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss, to the extent effective, and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. To the extent applicable, we perform effectiveness
assessments in order to use hedge accounting at each reporting period. For a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.   

We
also hedge our net investment in certain European operations. Changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain European operations are recorded as an unrealized
currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss.   

          Our
revenues and expenses are denominated in various foreign currencies, and our cash flows and earnings are thus subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variations. From time to
time, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in foreign currency rates. Where practicable, we generally net multicurrency cash
balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. Certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions, principally
through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts (generally with maturities of one year or less). We do not hedge our foreign currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the
effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $176 million in notional amount (in U.S. dollar equivalents)
outstanding in forward foreign currency contracts.   

          Huntsman
International has entered into two interest rate contracts to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in LIBOR under our Senior
Credit   

  88  

Table of Contents   

  Facilities.
These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in
millions):   

Beginning
in 2009, Arabian Amines Company entered into a 12-year floating to fixed interest rate contract providing for a receipt of LIBOR interest payments for a fixed payment of 5.02%.
In connection with the consolidation of Arabian Amines Company as of July 1, 2010, the interest rate contract is now included in our consolidated results. See "Note 4. Variable Interest
Entities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The notional amount of the swap as of September 30, 2016 was $20 million, and the interest rate contract is not designated
as a cash flow hedge. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the swap was $2 million and was recorded in noncurrent liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For
each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a reduction of interest expense of nil due to changes in fair value of the swap.   

          In
November 2014, we entered into two five year cross-currency interest rate contracts and one eight year cross-currency interest rate contract to swap an aggregate notional
$200 million for an aggregate notional  161 million. This swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. Under the cross-currency
interest rate contract, we will receive fixed U.S. dollar payments of $5 million semiannually on May 15 and November 15 (equivalent to an annual rate of 5.125%) and make interest
payments of approximately  3 million (equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 3.6%). As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of this swap was $21 million
and was recorded in noncurrent assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.   

          In
March 2010, we entered into three five year cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional $350 million for an aggregate notional
 255 million. This swap was designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we terminated these
cross-currency interest rate contracts and received $66 million in payments from the counterparties.   

A
portion of our debt is denominated in euros. We also finance certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are, in many cases, denominated in currencies other than
the entities' functional currency. We manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means, including cross-currency swaps, the designation of certain intercompany loans
as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges.   

          Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on
intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on our condensed statements of comprehensive income (loss). From time to time, we review
such designation of intercompany loans.   

          We
review our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. As of September 30, 2016, we have designated
approximately  671 million (approximately $754 million) of euro-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate contracts as a hedge of our net investment. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the amount of loss recognized on the hedge of our net investment was $11 million   

  89  

Table of Contents   

  and
$18 million, respectively, and was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).    

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES            

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that,
as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

          No
changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). However, we can only give reasonable assurance that our
internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could cause investors to lose
confidence in our reported financial information and could result in a lower trading price for our securities.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION            

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS            

          During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no material developments with respect to material legal proceedings
referenced in Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS            

          For information regarding risk factors, see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the risk factors noted in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors are applicable to the Company.   

The proposed spin-off of our Pigments   Additives and Textile Effects businesses is contingent upon
the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us if not completed.      

          On October 28, 2016, we announced plans to spin off our Pigments   Additives and Textile Effects businesses into a separate,
publicly traded company we refer to as "SpinCo." Completion of the proposed spin-off is subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions
that could delay, prevent, or otherwise adversely affect the spin-off. Completion of the spin-off will be contingent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, authorization and approval of
our Board of Directors, receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS, receipt of a tax opinion regarding the tax-free status of the spin-off, completion of new financing arrangements, execution of
ancillary agreements, and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the spin-off will be completed as expected, if at all.   

          In
pursuing the proposed spin-off, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences, including, but not limited to, the
following:  

execution of the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from management, which may postpone the execution of other
initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;   
            completion of the spin-off will require strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations, which
could lead to a disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and to complete the proposed spin-off;    
            completion of the spin-off may require certain management and procedural redundancies as we prepare for the spin-off, which may result in
operating inefficiencies; and   
            we will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees, whether
or not it is completed.    

We
may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spin-off.   

Any
of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.   

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off.      

          We may not realize some or all of the financial, operational, managerial, and other anticipated benefits from the spin-off, or the spin-off may
not provide such benefits on the scale we anticipate. In addition, we will incur one-time costs in connection with the spin-off that may negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve.   

  91  

Table of Contents   

If the proposed spin-off of our Pigments   Additives and Textile Effects businesses is completed, the
trading price of our common stock will likely decline.      

          We expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spin-off to be lower than immediately preceding the spin-off, as the
trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our Pigments   Additives and Textile Effects businesses. In addition, there can be no assurance that that the combined
value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies following the completion of the spin-off will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the
proposed spin-off not occurred.   

The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.      

          The spin-off is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). We are seeking, and completion of the spin-off is conditioned upon the receipt of, a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to the effect
that our retention of SpinCo Class A common stock will not be in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of federal income tax, that certain post-spin-off
exchanges of such SpinCo stock for our Company's indebtedness will be treated as tax-free under Section 355 and 361 of the Code and that certain payments or transfers of assets and liabilities
that may occur following the spin-off will be treated as part of the spin-off transaction (the "IRS Ruling"). If the IRS Ruling is received, our tax counsel is expected to issue an opinion that our
pro rata distribution of all outstanding SpinCo Class B common stock to our stockholders qualifies as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and
that certain elements of the restructuring transactions undertaken as part of the spin-off will also qualify for tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 361 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the
"Tax Opinion").   

          The
tax-free treatment of the spin-off will be contingent on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinion, both of which will be based on certain facts, representations
and undertakings. If any of such facts, representations or undertakings are not correct, are incomplete, or are violated, the IRS Ruling could be revoked or modified by the IRS and our Company's
ability to rely on the Tax Opinion could be jeopardized. If the spin-off distribution, and/or related internal transactions, were determined to be taxable, Huntsman or SpinCo could incur significant
U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the spin-off were deemed to be taxable, each holder of Huntsman common stock who received shares of SpinCo would generally be treated as receiving
a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of SpinCo received.   

          Even
if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in a corporate-level taxable gain to our Company if 50 percent or more, by vote or
value, of Huntsman or SpinCo common stock, is treated as acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related
transactions that includes the distribution. In that event, while our Company would recognize a taxable gain as described above, the distribution would be tax-free to our common stockholders.

CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO EXCHANGE ACT RULES 13A-14(A) and 15D-14(A),   AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002            

  I,
Peter R. Huntsman, certify that:   

          1.     I
have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Huntsman Corporation and Huntsman International LLC;   

2.     Based
on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   

          3.     Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the registrants as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.     The
registrants' other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrants and have:   

(a)   Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrants, including their consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;   

          (b)   Designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

          (c)   Evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrants' disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

(d)   Disclosed
in this report any change in the registrants' internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrants' most recent fiscal quarter (the
registrants' fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrants' internal control over financial
reporting; and   

5.     The
registrants' other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrants'
auditors and the audit committee of the registrants' board of directors or board of managers, as applicable (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

(a)   All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the registrants' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

          (b)   Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrants' internal control over financial
reporting.
