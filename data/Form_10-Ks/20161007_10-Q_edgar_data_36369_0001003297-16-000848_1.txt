1.        
  Business and Significant Accounting Policies:   

Business   

First Hartford Corporation,
which was incorporated in Maine in 1909, and its subsidiaries (the Company), is
engaged in two business segments: 1) the purchase, development, ownership,
management and sale of real estate and 2) providing preferred developer
services for two corporate franchise operators (i.e.,  Fee for Service ).  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
wholly owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which the Company has a
controlling financial interest, including those where the Company has been
determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or meets
certain criteria as a sole general partner or managing member in accordance
with the consolidation guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification.  As such, included in the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements are the accounts of Rockland Place Apartments
Limited Partnership and Clarendon Hill Somerville Limited Partnership, in which
the Company is the sole general partner.  The Company s ownership percentage in
these variable interest entity partnerships is nominal.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8.03 of Regulation S-X. 
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals and adjustments) considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included.  Operating results for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire
year.  The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2016 was
derived from the audited financial statements for the year then ended.  For
further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2016.  

Because the Company is engaged
in the development and sale of real estate at various stages of construction,
the operating cycle may extend beyond one year.  Accordingly, following the
usual practice of the real estate industry, the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets are unclassified.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases,
(Topic 842), which is intended to improve financial reporting around leasing
transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that engage
in lease transactions (both lessee and lessor) that lease assets such as real
estate and manufacturing equipment. This ASU will require organizations that
lease assets referred to as  leases  to recognize on the balance sheet the
assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods within those years beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is in
process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on its
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

For further discussions on ASUs,
refer to the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 2016.

1.        
  Business and Significant Accounting Policies (continued):   

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share   

Basic income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to
the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator) during the reporting
periods.  Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by increasing the
denominator by the weighted average number of additional shares that could have
been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock, such as stock
options and warrants (using the  treasury stock  method).  

There were
no common stock equivalents outstanding at July 31, 2016 or July 31, 2015.     

Financial
Instruments and Fair Value   

The Company s financial
instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable
securities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and debt.  The fair values of
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are estimated to
approximate their carrying amounts because of their relative short-term
nature.  In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt approximates its
fair value.  Further, the carrying amount of fixed rate debt approximates fair
value since the interest rates on the debt approximates the Company s current
incremental borrowing rate.  Marketable securities consist of equity securities
and are stated at fair value based on the last sale of the period obtained from
recognized stock exchanges (i.e. Level 1). Accumulated other comprehensive
(loss) income consists solely of unrealized gains (losses) on marketable
securities.  

Segment Information   

The factors used by the
Company to identify reportable segments include differences in products and
services and segregated operations within the Company. The first segment,  Real
Estate Operations  participates in the purchase, development, management,
ownership and sale of real estate. Within its second segment,  Fee for
Service , the Company provides preferred developer services to CVS and
Cumberland Farms Inc. in certain geographic areas.  Summary financial
information for the two reportable segments is as follows:  

All costs after operating
expenses are costs of the real estate operation.

Segment Information
(concluded):   

The only assets in the balance
sheet belonging to the Fee for Service segment is restricted cash of $1,295,799
on July 31, 2016 and $1,664,214 on April 30, 2016 and receivables of $4,648,743
on July 31, 2016 and $5,956,103 on April 30, 2016.  

2.        
  Consolidated Variable Interest Entities and Investments in
Affiliated Partnerships:   

The Company has consolidated both Rockland
and Clarendon based on the express legal rights and obligations provided to it
by the underlying partnership agreements and its control of their business
activity.  The assets of these partnerships that can only be used to settle
their obligations and their liabilities for which creditors (or beneficial
interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company are
shown parenthetically in the line items of the consolidated balance sheets.  A
summary of the assets and liabilities of Rockland and Clarendon included in the
Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets follows:  

The Company accounts for its
50% ownership interest in Dover Parkade, LLC under the equity method of
accounting.  A summary of the operating results for this entity follows:

3.        
  Income Taxes:   

The Company files a Federal
consolidated tax return to report all income and deductions for its
subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in
several states. The tax returns are filed by the entity that owns the real
estate or provides services in such state. Some states do not allow a
consolidated or combined tax filing. Therefore, in the quarter ended July 31,
2016, state income taxes are greater than expected as income for some
subsidiaries cannot be offset by other subsidiaries with operating losses.   

In the quarter ended July 31,
2015, the Company had taxable income but had sufficient loss carryforwards so
income tax expense was minimal.    

4.          
 Litigation:   

On September 7, 2016, the Company was notified it lost the
first of two companion lawsuits against a former tenant for wrongful
termination of its separate leases at two of the Company s commercial shopping
centers.  As a result, the Company has accrued a liability of $198,000 as
of July 31, 2016 to cover reimbursement of defendant s claimed legal fees and
costs.  The Company is evaluating its options, including whether to appeal
the decision, contest the claimed fee amounts, and/or whether to continue to
proceed with the second companion lawsuit.  There were no other changes in litigation
since April 30, 2016.  

5.          
 Refinancings:   

Rockland Place Apartments LP  
Refinance:    On June 3, 2016, Rockland Place Apartments LP executed a First
Mortgage Note payable with the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency in the
amount of $14,300,000.  The note is nonrecourse, has a 40-year term and
requires monthly payments of principal and interest of $54,628.  The interest
rate is fixed at 3.41%.  The proceeds of the note were used to repay its bridge
mortgage note with a principal balance of $591,174, its Fourth Mortgage Note
with a principal balance of $500,000, and its Flexible Subsidy Capital
Improvement Loan with a principal balance of $4,268,539.  The proceeds also
funded closing costs and certain escrows that are being used to redevelop the
complex.    

6.          
 Purchases
of Real Estate:   

Buda, TX Land Purchases   : On April
29, 2016, the Company purchased a parcel of land in Buda, TX adjacent to
another parcel owned by the Company for $686,167 including closing costs.  On
May 13, 2016, the Company purchased three additional parcels of land adjacent
to these parcels for $1,051,034 including closing costs. These purchases were
financed by a new land loan of $1,505,000 with the balance funded by working
capital.  Key terms of the loan are as follows:

7.          
 Subsequent
Events:   

The Company has evaluated for subsequent
events through October 7, 2016, the date the financial statements were issued.  

Edinburg, TX - Refinance:    On
September 7, 2016, the Company partially refinanced its loans on its shopping
center property in Edinburg, TX.  The new loan with Goldman Sachs is for
$32,500,000 and is secured by the shopping center.  Proceeds from this new loan
were used to pay off $31,030,767 of existing debt with Protective Life and to
establish a $1,100,000 Earnout Reserve Account (ERA), with the balance used to
fund escrows and pay closing costs.  The remainder of the existing debt of $15,926,740
is secured by vacant land of approximately 50 acres attached to the shopping
center.  The $1,100,000 ERA will be returned to the Company if, within two
years, it can provide evidence that two significant named tenants have renewed
their lease options for an additional five years (or the Company has entered
into Approved Substitute Lease(s) for same) and the Earnout Debt Yield (EDY),
as defined, is equal to or greater than 8.30%.  If the Company fails to do so, a
minimum of $1,000,000 of the ERA will be used to reduce the principal balance
of the loan and up to $100,000 will be used to pay the applicable yield
maintenance premium.   The loan has a 30 year amortization and duration of 10
years (i.e., maturity date of September 6, 2026) with an interest rate of 4.604%. 
For the first year, interest only is paid monthly; beginning in October 2017, principal
and interest are paid monthly.  Prepayment of the loan is generally prohibited. 
The Company receives income directly to its operating account unless a  trigger
event  occurs in which case the cash goes into a lockbox account controlled by
the lender.  Basic  trigger events  include:   

Failure to maintain a 12 month-rolling Debt-Service Coverage
Ratio (DSCR), as defined, of 1.1:1.0,   

Failure to maintain a market-based Net Worth, as defined, of
$20,000,000,   

Failure to maintain Liquid Assets, as defined, of $2,000,000,  

Loan default,  

Various Rollover Trigger Events, which include certain
significant named tenants vacating, terminating or not renewing their leases,
or filing for bankruptcy and not replaced with an Approved Substitute Lease, as
defined.   

In addition, if a significant named tenant
goes dark, vacates, or is not in occupancy of substantially all of its current
space, the Company would have to deposit either a $2,000,000 reserve or letter
of credit with the lender until such time as agreed upon lease conditions being
met.   

With respect to the remaining balance of $15,926,740
from the original loans with Protective Life now secured by vacant land of
approximately 50 acres directly adjacent to the shopping center, the Company and
the lender have agreed that if the Company repays $2,000,000 of the balance by
November 7, 2016, the interest rate on the remaining balance will be reduced
from 5.0% to 4.0%.  The lender has also agreed that if the Company pays off the
entire loan by September 6, 2017, its 50% Additional
Interest Agreement (AIA) rights will terminate.  This remaining loan is
personally guaranteed by the Chairman of the Company.  
  
 Austin, TX   Land Sale:     On
September 20, 2016, the Company sold a parcel of land in Austin, TX for
$6,100,000 (cost of approximately $4,150,000) that was previously ground leased. 
The Company continues to own land attached to the sold parcel and is currently
overseeing construction of a single-tenant retail building of approximately
6,900 square feet on this property.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF   
                
 OPERATIONS     

The financial and business analysis below provides
information which the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and
understanding of the Company s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.  This analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and related notes.  

The following discussion and certain other sections of this
Report on Form 10-Q contain statements reflecting the Company s views about its
future performance and constitute  forward-looking statements  under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These views may involve risk
and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and may cause the Company s
actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in such
forward-looking statements.  Readers should consider how various factors
including changes in general economic conditions, cost of materials, interest
rates and availability of funds, and the nature of competition and relationship
with key tenants may affect the Company s performance.  The Company undertakes
no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or other.  

Critical Accounting
Policies   

There have been no significant changes in the Company s
critical accounting policies from those included in Item 7 of its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 under the subheading  Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates .    

Results of Operations 
Rental Income:   

Rental income for the
quarters ended July 31, by type of tenant, follows:  

The slight increase in residential rental income was
primarily caused by a decrease in vacancies at the Somerville, MA (i.e.,
Clarendon) property.  

The increase in commercial rental income was primarily
caused by rents received on the Company s development properties (e.g., New
Orleans, LA, Stanhope, NJ, Olathe, KS, etc.) and additional rents from new
tenants at the West Springfield, MA and Edinburg, TX properties, partially
offset by the impact of the voluntary foreclosure of the Putnam, CT property on
June 5, 2015.   

Service Income   

Service income for the
quarters ended July 31 follows:

OPERATIONS
(continued):    

Results of Operations
(continued):   

Service Income
(continued):   

The decrease in preferred developer fees reflected lower
fees received from both CVS and Cumberland Farms.  The decrease in CVS fees was
the result of a recent acquisition that has impacted in the slowing of their
pipeline for new stores.  The decrease in Cumberland Farms was the result of
timing of closings based on the construction schedule.   

Sales (and Cost of
Sales) of Real Estate   

Three months ended July 31, 2016:   

On June 29, 2016, the Company sold a property in Stanhope,
NJ for $10,000,051 (cost of $8,268,070).  A construction loan with a balance of
$6,329,667 was paid off with the proceeds.  

On June 30, 2016, the Company sold a portion of its
property in Edinburg, TX (i.e., Texas Roadhouse) for $2,210,000 (cost of $1,355,597). 
A mortgage loan with a balance of $1,279,136 was paid off with the proceeds.  

Three months ended July 31, 2015: 
   On May 28, 2015, the Company sold a parcel of land in
Pearland, TX for $1,104,161 (cost of $747,610).  

There were also costs related to property sales that
occurred in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 totaling $188,602 that were
not anticipated as of the prior fiscal year end.  

Other Revenues   

The increase in other income was primarily at the liquor
store, which obtained a liquor license in December 2014.  The sales at the
store have been increasing steadily as previously the store only sold beer and
wine.    

Operating Costs and
Expenses:   

Rental Expenses   

Rental expenses for the
quarters ended July 31, by type of tenant, follows:  

The slight increase in residential rental expenses were
mainly from increased repairs and painting expenses at the Somerville, MA (i.e.,
Clarendon) property.

Results of Operations

Operating Costs and
Expenses (concluded):   

Rental Expenses
(concluded:   

The slight decrease in commercial rental expenses were
mainly due to prior year professional and legal expenses incurred as part of
the initial effort to refinance the debt at the Cranston, RI shopping center,
largely offset by a legal liability of $198,000 as a result of the Company
losing the first of two companion lawsuits against a former tenant for wrongful
termination of its separate leases at two of the Company s commercial shopping
centers (see Note 4 of the Financial Statements included within for discussion)
and accelerated amortization expense of deferred commissions arising from the
sale of a portion of its property in Edinburg, TX (i.e., Texas Roadhouse).     

Service Expenses   

Service expenses for
the quarters ended July 31 follows:  

The decrease in preferred developer expenses and fees primarily
reflects lower commissions paid commensurate with the lower revenue, primarily
at Cumberland Farms.    

Selling, General and
Administrative ( SG A )    

There was a slight decrease in SG A expenses; there
were no individually significant items contributing to this decrease.

OPERATIONS
(continued):    

Non-Operating Income
(Expense) (continued):   

Interest Expense
(concluded):   

The increase in commercial interest expense was the result
of expense related to loans for the Company s development properties (e.g., New
Orleans, LA, Stanhope, NJ, Olathe, KS, etc.), partially offset by savings from
the prior year refinancings at Cranston and CP Associates.  

The increase in residential interest expense was the result
of the refinancing at Rockland as discussed in Note 5 of the Financial
Statements included within.  Note the loans paid off as part of this
refinancing did not accrue interest.  

Gain on Voluntary Foreclosure   

Putnam, CT   Transfer to Lender:    On November 1,
2014, a payment was due for the mortgage of the shopping center in Putnam,
Connecticut in the amount of approximately $4,700,000.  The rentable space of
the shopping center is 57,529 square feet, 46% of which was leased to one
store.  That store informed the Company that they were not renewing their
lease, which expired on January 31, 2015, and, as a result, the Company found
it impossible to refinance the mortgage without finding a replacement tenant. 
Therefore, on June 5, 2015, the Company agreed to transfer title of the
property to the lender.  The Company recognized a gain of $2,649,850 since the
mortgage was non-recourse and was in excess of the book value.  Pre-tax income
for this shopping center was $44,645 for the quarter ended July 31, 2015.  

Other Income   

Other income for the
quarters ended July 31 follows:  

The decrease in
investment income reflected realized gains on sales of securities in the prior
year that did not repeat in the current year.   

Gain (Loss) on
Derivatives (Non-Cash)   

The Company, through its 50% owned consolidated subsidiaries,
has entered into two separate floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements
with banks that expire in May 2025 and July 2031.  The Company has determined
that these derivative instruments do not meet the requirements of hedge
accounting and have therefore recorded the change in fair value of these
derivative instruments through income.  Note that the change in fair value
recorded through income is a non-cash item.

Non-Operating Income
(Expense) (concluded):   

Equity in Earnings of
Unconsolidated Subsidiary    

The equity in earnings
of unconsolidated subsidiary for the quarters ended July 31 follows:       

The Company has an investment in an affiliated limited
liability entity Dover Parkade, LLC, (Dover).  The Company has a 50% interest
in Dover which owns a shopping center in Dover Township, NJ.  The operating and
financial policies of Dover are not controlled by the Company.  For the years
prior to May 1, 2009, the Company was committed to providing funding to this
equity method investee.  The Company s investment was recorded at cost and
subsequently adjusted for its share of their net income and losses and distributions.
To 2009, losses and distributions from Dover exceeded the Company s
investment.  Since then, distributions from Dover have been credited to
income.  The Company does not control the rate of distributions of Dover.  Such
distributions are in excess of Dover s net assets since its accumulated net
losses (including significant amounts for depreciation and amortization) have
exceeded capital contributions.  

Income Taxes   

The Company files a Federal consolidated tax return to
report all income and deductions for its subsidiaries. The Company and its
subsidiaries file income tax returns in several states. The tax returns are
filed by the entity that owns the real estate or provides services in such
state. Some states do not allow a consolidated or combined tax filing.
Therefore, in the quarter ended July 31, 2016, state income taxes are greater
than expected as income for some subsidiaries cannot be offset by other
subsidiaries with operating losses.   

In the quarter ended July 31, 2015, the Company had taxable
income but had sufficient loss carryforwards so income tax expense was
minimal.    

Capital Resources and Liquidity   

At July 31, 2016, the Company had $5,570,694 of
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. This includes $3,666,866 belonging to partnership
entities in which the Company s financial interests range from .01% (VIEs) to
50%.  Funds received from CVS, which are to be paid out in connection with CVS
developments, amounted to $1,295,799 and tenant security deposits held by VIEs
of $406,029 are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents.

Capital Resources and Liquidity (concluded):   

At July 31, 2016, the Company had $1,470,491 of investments
in marketable securities, all of which belongs to partner entities.  

The sources of future borrowings that may be needed for new
construction loans, property purchases, or balloon payments on existing loans
are unclear at this time.  On December 7, 2015, the Company entered into a
$2,000,000 revolving demand loan agreement ( line of credit ) with a regional
bank.  The interest rate on this loan is Wall Street Journal Prime, with a
floor of 3.25%.  The loan is unsecured and there are no guarantors.  Interest
is to be paid monthly; principal is to be repaid within twelve months or on
demand, at the bank s discretion.  There are no prepayment penalties.  This
line of credit will primarily be used from time to time to fund initial investments
related to development opportunities.  As of July 31, 2016, the Company had
borrowings of $1,694,091 against this credit line.  The Company also obtained
another credit line as part of a purchase of land in Austin, TX as described in
Note 17 to the Company s financial statements included in the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. This $2,760,000
line of credit will primarily be used from time to time to fund initial
investments related to development opportunities.  As of July 31, 2016, the
Company had borrowings of $1,333,000 against this credit line.

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures , as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chairman and Treasurer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  We
conducted an evaluation (the  Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the
participation of our Chairman and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures ( Disclosure Controls )
as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15b of the
Exchange Act.  Based on the Evaluation, our Chairman and Treasurer concluded
that because of weaknesses in our control environment, our disclosure controls
were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
Notwithstanding weaknesses in our control environment, as of July 31, 2016, we
believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this
report present fairly the Company s financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented.
