   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (unaudited)     
   September 30, 2016   
     
   1. Organization and Basis of Presentation   
     
  The condensed financial statements of Reef Oil   Gas Income and Development Fund III, L.P. (the  Partnership ) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. We have recorded all transactions and adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Quarterly Report ). The adjustments are normal and recurring. The following notes describe only the material changes in accounting policies, account details, or financial statement notes during the first nine months of 2016. Therefore, please read these unaudited condensed financial statements and notes to unaudited condensed financial statements together with the audited financial statements and notes to financial statements contained in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Annual Report ). The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
   Going Concern   
     
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Partnership is a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm s opinion included in our Annual Report includes an explanatory paragraph regarding the Partnership s limited life, and management s plan to sell all remaining assets of the Partnership, wind up and terminate the Partnership during 2016, as specified in the Partnership s governing documents at its inception. It is likely that the sale of all Partnership assets will not be completed until early 2017, and the termination of the Partnership will not occur until 2017. As of September 30, 2016 the Partnership owned interests in approximately 280 wells, compared to over 600 wells at December 31, 2015. Reef does not expect sales proceeds from the sale of the Partnership s remaining assets will allow partners to recover their full investment in the Partnership. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for a limited life entity, the Partnership has not applied the liquidation basis of accounting to these financial statements.  
     
   Conversion of General Partner Interests   
     
  In accordance with the Partnership s Limited Partnership Agreement, all units of general partner interest are to be converted to units of limited partner interest in the year following completion of drilling activities of the Partnership. During October of 2015, management of the Partnership initiated a plan to sell all of the Partnership s assets, and, in connection with that plan, the Partnership has ceased participation in drilling activities. Effective March 1, 2016, with the exception of certain interest held by the managing general partner, all other units of general partner interest held by investor partners were converted into units of limited partner interest. Investor general partners will have limited liability as a limited partner for any Partnership operations conducted after the conversion date. However, investor general partners continue to have unlimited liability regarding Partnership activities that occurred prior to the conversion date.  
     
   2. Summary of Accounting Policies   
     
   Oil and Gas Properties   
     
  The Partnership follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method, all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with acquisition of properties and successful, as well as unsuccessful, exploration and development activities are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties and estimated future development costs, excluding unproved properties, are based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved reserves.  For these purposes, proved natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent ( BOE ) at a rate of 6 thousand cubic feet ( Mcf ) of natural gas to 1 barrel ( Bbl ) of crude oil. Under the full cost method of accounting, sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless such disposition would  
     
 4   

Table of Contents   
     
  significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized gain on sale of oil and gas properties totaling $0 and $100,543, respectively. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership recognized gain on sale of oil and gas properties totaling $0 and $1,673,100, respectively.  
     
  In applying the full cost method, the Partnership performs a quarterly ceiling test on the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, whereby the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost ceiling, which is defined as the sum of the estimated future net revenues from the Partnership s proved reserves using prices that are the preceding 12-month un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for crude oil and natural gas held constant and discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties, if any. If capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, and is shown as a reduction of oil and gas properties and as property impairment expense on the Partnership s statements of operations. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized $0 and $140,003 of impairment expense of proved properties, respectively. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership recognized $1,735,074 and $5,204,490 of impairment expense of proved properties, respectively.  
     
   Estimates of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves   
     
  The estimates of the Partnership s proved reserves at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC rules and accounting standards which require SEC reporting entities to prepare their reserve estimates using pricing based upon the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices over the preceding 12-month period and end of period costs. Future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than these prices and costs, which would impact the estimate of reserves and future cash flows. The Partnership s proved reserve information at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was based upon evaluations prepared by the senior reservoir engineer for Reef Exploration, L.P. ( RELP ), an affiliate of the Partnership and Reef Oil and Gas Partners, L.P. ( Reef ), the managing general partner of the Partnership.  
     
  Reservoir engineering, which is the process of estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves, is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. These estimates are dependent upon many variables, and changes occur as knowledge of these variables evolves. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise, and are subject to considerable upward or downward adjustments. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances could be material. In addition, reserve estimates for properties which have not yet been drilled, or properties with a limited production history may be less reliable than estimates for properties with longer production histories.  
     
  Reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the Partnership s depletion and impairment calculations. As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates. If proved reserve estimates decline, the rate at which depletion expense is recorded increases, reducing future net income. A decline in estimated proved reserves and future cash flows, whether caused by declining commodity prices or downward adjustments to the rate of production from Partnership wells, also reduces the capitalized cost ceiling and may result in increased impairment expense.  
     
   Restoration, Removal and Environmental Liabilities   
     
  The Partnership is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the Partnership to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum substances at various sites. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed.  
     
  Liabilities for expenditures of a non-capital nature are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation is probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are generally undiscounted values unless the timing of cash payments for the liability or component is fixed or reliably determinable.

Table of Contents   
     
  The Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new well is drilled or acquired.  Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.  
     
  The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life.  The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate.  Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well.  
     
  The following table summarizes the Partnership s asset retirement obligation for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable from affiliates, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to their short-term nature.  
     
   Recent Accounting Developments   Revenue Recognition   
     
  The following recently issued accounting pronouncement has been adopted or may impact the Partnership in future periods:  
     
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ) in May 2014, which provides accounting guidance for all revenues arising from contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The requirements of ASU 2014-09 will supersede prior revenue recognition requirements and most prior industry-specific guidance throughout the FASB s accounting standards codification, and will be effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Partnership is still considering the method of adoption but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially impact its operating results, financial position or cash flow.  
     
   3   . Transactions with Affiliates  
     
  Reef initially purchased 1% of the total Partnership units (8.9697 units of general partner interest), and received an additional 10% general partner interest as compensation for forming the Partnership. This 10% interest is  carried  by the Investor Partners and Reef pays no drilling or completion expenses for this interest. In addition, Reef has purchased 1.30 units of Partnership interest from investor partners. Effective September 1, 2015 Reef receives 11.13% and investor partners receive 88.87% of total cash distributions. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Reef received $131,349 and $1,965, respectively, in cash distributions related to its Partnership interest.

Table of Contents   
     
  The Partnership has no employees. RELP employs a staff including geologists, petroleum engineers, landmen and accounting personnel who administer all of the Partnership s operations. RELP is entitled to receive drilling compensation in an amount equal to 15% of the total well costs paid by the Partnership for wells operated by RELP. RELP served as the operator of the Partnership s Slaughter Field in Cochran County, Texas and the wells in which the Partnership held an interest thereon (the  Slaughter Dean Wells ) prior to their sale during the second quarter of 2015.  RELP also receives drilling compensation in an amount equal to 5% of the total well costs paid by the Partnership for all non-operated wells. While the Partnership has not engaged in oil and gas drilling activities during 2016, total well costs also include the costs of all developmental activities on a well, such as reworking, working over, deepening, sidetracking, fracturing a producing well, installing pipeline for a well or any other activity incident to the operations of a well, excluding ordinary well operating costs after completion.  Total well costs do not include costs relating to lease acquisitions.  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, RELP received $1,175 and $13,564, respectively, in drilling compensation. Drilling compensation payments are included in oil and gas properties in the financial statements.  
     
  Additionally, Reef and its affiliates are reimbursed for direct costs and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Partnership. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership paid or accrued to Reef and its affiliates $20,583 and $44,595, respectively, for direct costs and paid or accrued to Reef and its affiliates $0 and $2,805, respectively, for out of pocket expenses. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership paid or accrued to Reef and its affiliates $17,895 and $67,963, respectively, for direct costs and paid or accrued to Reef and its affiliates $206 and $2,579, respectively, for out of pocket expenses.  
     
  RELP allocates its general and administrative expenses as overhead to all of the partnerships to which it provides services, and this allocation is a significant portion of the Partnership s general and administrative expenses. The allocation of RELP s overhead to the partnerships to which it provides services is based upon several factors, including the level of drilling activity, revenues, and capital and operating expenditures of each partnership compared to the total levels of all partnerships. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the administrative overhead charged by RELP to the Partnership totaled $33,079 and $62,326, respectively. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the administrative overhead charged by RELP to the Partnership totaled $82,796 and $275,005, respectively. The administrative overhead charged by RELP is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. RELP s general and administrative costs include all customary and routine expenses, accounting, office rent, telephone, secretarial, salaries and other incidental expenses incurred by RELP or its affiliates that are necessary to the conduct of the Partnership s business, whether generated by RELP, its affiliates or third parties, but excluding direct and operating costs.  
     
  RELP processes joint interest billings and revenue payments on behalf of the Partnership. At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, RELP owed the Partnership $106,855 and $135,851, respectively, for net revenues processed in excess of joint interest, drilling compensation, direct costs, and out-of-pocket expenses. The cash associated with net revenues processed by RELP is normally received by RELP from oil and gas purchasers 30-60 days after the end of the month to which the revenues pertain. The Partnership settles its balances with Reef and RELP on at least an annual basis.

   Going Concern   
     
  Management is currently pursuing the sale of all Partnership assets. As a result, the Partnership is not expected to continue as a going concern. While the original intent was to wind up and terminate the Partnership during 2016, it

  is likely that the sale of all Partnership assets will not be completed until early 2017, and the termination of the Partnership will not occur until 2017. As of September 30, 2016 the Partnership owned interests in approximately 280 wells, compared to over 600 wells at December 31, 2015. Reef does not expect sales proceeds from the sale of the Partnership s remaining assets will allow partners to recover their full investment in the Partnership. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for a limited life entity, the Partnership has not applied the liquidation basis of accounting to these financial statements.  
     
   Overview / Outlook   
     
  Reef Oil   Gas Income and Development Fund III, L.P. is a Texas limited partnership formed on November 27, 2007. The Partnership was formed to purchase working interests in oil and gas properties with the purposes of (i) growing the value of properties through the development of proved undeveloped reserves, (ii) generating revenue from the production of crude oil and natural gas, (iii) distributing cash to the partners of the Partnership, and (iv) selling the properties, subject to certain market conditions, no earlier than 2010, but expected no later than 2015, in order to maximize return to the partners of the Partnership. Reef is the managing general partner of the Partnership.  
     
  The Partnership sought to purchase working interests in oil and gas properties with both proved producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. Between November 27, 2007 and June 30, 2010, the Partnership made three major property acquisitions with the capital raised by the Partnership, referred to as the Slaughter Dean acquisition, Azalea acquisition, and Lett acquisition, and acquired working interests in over 1,500 wells located in twelve states. On all properties purchased, the Partnership planned to produce existing proved reserves and develop any proved undeveloped reserves, but not to engage in exploratory drilling for unproved reserves. Drilling locations with unproved reserves, if any, could be farmed out or sold to third parties or other partnerships formed by Reef.  
     
  The management of the operations and other business of the Partnership is the responsibility of RELP, an affiliate of Reef and the Partnership. RELP served as operator of the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties prior to their sale in 2015. All wells included in the Azalea and Lett acquisitions are operated by third parties not affiliated with the Partnership, Reef, or any other Reef affiliate. The most significant property acquired in the Azalea and Lett acquisitions was a working interest in the Thums Long Beach Unit located underneath the Long Beach Harbor in Southern California. The Thums Long Beach Unit was sold during the fourth quarter of 2015.  
     
  As a result of the decrease in commodity prices which began during the third quarter of 2014, Reef decided to delay the sale of Partnership properties until prices recovered, with the hope of maximizing return to the investor partners. The sole exception to this policy was the Partnership s working interest in the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties. The waterflood development project implemented by Reef on the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties had not proven to be successful, and this older field exhibited high operating costs and also high workover costs. The Slaughter Dean acquisition properties were sold during the second quarter of 2015.  
     
  As commodity prices continued to decline throughout 2015, the Partnership saw its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows being severely adversely affected. The Partnership is not engaged in commodity futures trading or hedging activities, and does not have significant cash reserves on hand, since cash flows are normally distributed on a regular basis to the investor partners. During the first two quarters of 2015 working capital was being drained because the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties were being operated at a deficit. During the third quarter of 2015, lease operating costs, production taxes, and general and administrative expenses of the remaining Azalea and Lett acquisition properties exceeded revenues. Without a recovery in commodity prices, the Partnership would need to either borrow funds from Reef or sell properties to generate cash to cover the deficits. As Reef was unable to project when or if commodity prices would significantly recover, a decision was made in October 2015 to begin marketing the remaining assets of the Partnership, with expectation to complete the divestiture of properties, wind up, and terminate the Partnership during 2016. Currently Reef believes that all remaining assets will not be sold until early 2017, and the termination of the Partnership will therefore occur during 2017.  
     
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership made six oil and gas property sales, totaling approximately 75 wells and representing, in the aggregate, approximately 6.5% of the Partnership s total reserves on a BOE basis, as measured by the Partnership s December 31, 2015 reserve report. Cash proceeds from these oil and gas property sales totaled $104,567.

  During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership made four oil and gas property sales, totaling approximately 125 wells and representing, in the aggregate, approximately 9.5% of the Partnership s total reserves on a BOE basis, as measured by the Partnership s December 31, 2015 reserve report. Cash proceeds from these oil and gas property sales totaled $17,040.  
     
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership made nine oil and gas property sales, totaling approximately 135 wells and representing, in the aggregate, approximately 12.2% of the Partnership s total reserves on a BOE basis, as measured by the Partnership s December 31, 2015 reserve report. Cash proceeds from these oil and gas property sales totaled $52,987.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership continues to own working interests in approximately 280 wells acquired in the Azalea acquisition, located in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Mississippi and Montana. The Partnership has divested of all of its Colorado, Kansas, Alabama, and Arkansas properties during the first nine months of 2016.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  The Partnership was funded with initial capital contributions totaling $89,410,519 from both non-Reef partners and Reef.  Non-Reef partners purchased 490.9827 units of general partner interest and 397.0172 units of limited partner interest for $88,648,094, net of adjustments for sales to brokers for their own accounts, who were permitted to buy units at a price net of the commission that they would normally earn on sales of units. Reef contributed $762,425 for the purchase of 8.9697 units of general partner interest at a price of $85,000 per unit, which is net of the 15% management fee paid by non-Reef investors. The 15% management fee used to pay organization and offering costs, including sales commissions, totaled $13,168,094, leaving capital contributions of $76,242,425 available for Partnership activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership had expended $81,413,383 on property acquisition and development costs, prior to sales of the Partnership s interests or portions of its interests in certain properties. Expenditures in excess of available capital have been financed through debt or property sales, or have been recovered from cash flows by reducing Partnership distributions.  
     
  Working capital has declined during the first nine months of 2016, from $1,640,865 at December 31, 2015 to $412,696 at September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the distribution of sales proceeds totaling $1,165,107 received from property sales made during 2015 and 2016 to the investor partners during the first nine months of 2016.  The Partnership has retained a portion of the cash received from property sales to cover any deficits during the divestiture of all remaining properties and the winding up and termination of the Partnership. The Partnership generally maintains nominal working capital, as cash flows are normally utilized to pay monthly cash distributions to the partners.  Sources of future funding consist of cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and cash flow from sales of properties.  The Partnership may not be able to sell properties at the values desired in order to achieve its objective of selling Partnership properties on terms that provide a favorable return to investors.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  The following is a comparative discussion of the results of operations for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the related notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.  
     
  Partnership gross revenues from the sale of oil and natural gas from Partnership properties during the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $30,000 per month, and are slowly declining as properties are divested. However, during the third quarter the Partnership reviewed and adjusted previous revenue accruals, which included revising downward the amounts of previous revenue accruals, as well as reversing previous revenue accruals on sold properties. The adjustment to revenue, which totaled $90,287, reduced oil and gas sales revenues from $90,755 to $468 for the third quarter of 2016. The accrual adjustments also affected production taxes by $23,368, and reduced production taxes from $9,620 to a negative amount of $13,748 for the third quarter of 2016. The Partnership expects that during the fourth quarter, assuming oil and gas prices remain relatively stable, revenues will decline from the approximate $30,000 per month level of the prior quarter, as properties continue to be divested. The Partnership saw a slight decline in the average oil price received from $38.37 per Bbl in the second quarter to $36.00 per Bbl in the third quarter. Gas prices received rose slightly from $1.66 per Mcf during the second quarter to $1.78 per Mcf

  during the third quarter. Nonetheless, as a result of the property sales already made by the Partnership, it is difficult for oil and gas revenues from the Partnership s remaining properties to cover both operating as well as administrative costs at current price levels.  
     
  The estimated net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below. Reserve estimates are calculated using pricing based upon the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices over the preceding 12-month period and end of period costs. At September 30, 2016, the un-weighted arithmetic average prices were $41.97 per Bbl of crude oil and $2.40 per Mcf of natural gas, compared to $59.32 per Bbl of crude oil and $3.00 per Mcf of natural gas at September 30, 2015.  
     
  Proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discussed in this section include only the amounts which the Partnership can estimate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future years from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Proved reserves include only quantities that the Partnership expects to recover commercially using current prices, costs, existing regulatory practices and technology. Therefore, any changes in future prices, costs, regulations, technology or other unforeseen factors could materially increase or decrease the proved reserve estimates.  

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   
     
  The Partnership had a net loss of $124,957 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $1,927,024 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. During the three month period ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership s net loss of $1,927,024 was impacted by impairment of proved property totaling $1,735,074, which was recognized primarily due to lower 2015 commodity prices which reduced proved recoverable reserves. The Partnership did not recognize any impairment of proved properties during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. Excluding impairment of proved properties, the Partnership net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $191,950.  
     
  Partnership revenues totaled $468 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $272,980 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Third quarter 2016 revenues were impacted by downward revisions to prior revenue accruals totaling $90,287 as discussed above, and totaled $90,755 prior to the accrual adjustments. Production taxes, which totaled $9,620 for the third quarter of 2016 prior to adjustment, were adjusted downward by $23,368 to a negative amount of $13,748 for the third quarter of 2016. Sales volumes and sales revenues are continuing to decline as a result of the divestiture of Partnership properties during 2016. As of September 30, 2016, gross revenues from Partnership oil and gas sales, at current pricing, are approximately $30,000 per month, and sales volumes will continue to decline during the fourth quarter. At September 30, 2016, 44% of the Partnership s reserves are oil reserves and 56% of the Partnership s reserves are natural gas reserves on a BOE basis, so the average price of both commodities significantly impacts Partnership results.  
     
  While crude oil prices have remained relatively stable since June 2016, Reef believes they are likely to remain volatile, and commodity prices will have a significant impact on the Partnership s future results of operations. The Partnership has not and is currently not engaged in commodity futures trading, hedging activities, or derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. The Partnership sells substantially all of its production from successful oil and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at current spot market prices. Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk for the volatility in commodity prices inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, and the level of commodity prices has a significant impact on the Partnership s results of operations.  
     
  Lease operating expenses decreased from $175,741 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 to $66,650 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the Partnership s divestiture of properties. Lease operating expenses on the Thums Long Beach Unit and the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties, which were sold in 2015, totaled $47,223 of the $175,741 in lease operating expense incurred during the third quarter of 2015. Currently oil and gas sales revenues are no longer sufficient to satisfy lease operating and general

  and administrative costs, and we expect this trend to continue until all properties have been divested and the Partnership terminated.  
     
  General and administrative costs decreased from $140,174 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 to $68,084 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The allocation of RELP s overhead to the Partnership is a significant portion of general and administrative expenses. The allocation of RELP s overhead to partnerships is based upon several factors, including the level of drilling activity, revenues, and capital and operating expenditures of each partnership compared to the total levels of all partnerships. As properties are sold and the Partnership s operations wind down, its overhead allocation has decreased accordingly. The administrative overhead charged to the Partnership decreased from $82,796 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 to $33,079 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. In addition, during the three month period ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership incurred third party engineering costs of approximately $20,000.  
     
   Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   
     
  The Partnership had a net loss of $278,843 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $4,406,651 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. After adjusting for the gain on sales of oil and gas properties, the Partnership had a net loss of $379,386 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $6,079,846 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The primary reasons for the change in operating results are depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and impairment expense.  
     
  During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership recognized impairment expense of proved property totaling $140,003 and $5,204,490, respectively, primarily due to declines in the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity price over the preceding 12 month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Property impairment expense in 2016 is greatly reduced from 2015 levels, as the Partnership recorded impairment expense in excess of $5.4 million during 2015, in addition to selling its working interests in the Thums Long Beach Unit and Slaughter Dean acquisition properties, resulting in a proved property valuation of only $760,460 as of December 31, 2015. Given the higher property basis and higher production volumes that existed during 2015, depletion expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $491,429, compared to $55,859 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Estimates of reserves and future net revenues from those reserves are calculated based upon the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices over the preceding 12-month period. At September 30, 2015, estimated reserves were calculated using average prices of $59.32 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.00 per Mcf of natural gas. At September 30, 2016, estimated reserves were calculated using average prices of $41.97 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.40 per Mcf of natural gas. The Partnership has seen commodity prices remain relatively stable since June 2016.  The Partnership did not record any impairment of proved properties during the third quarter of 2016, and we do not expect to record impairment of proved properties during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     
  Partnership revenues totaled $169,501 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,336,922 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Sales revenues were impacted by adjustments to revenue accruals totaling $90,287 during the third quarter of 2016, and totaled $259,788 prior to the accrual adjustments. Sales revenues from the Partnership s two major properties sold during 2015, the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties and the Thums Long Beach Unit, totaled $864,602, or 64.7% of the $1,336,922 in revenues received during the first nine months of 2015. At current oil and gas prices, the gross sales revenues received by the Partnership for its remaining oil and gas properties are approximately $30,000 per month, and this level will decline as additional properties are divested. Production taxes, which totaled $28,130 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 prior to adjustment, were impacted by the revenue accrual adjustments and were adjusted downward by $23,368 to a reported amount of $4,762 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  While crude oil prices have risen into the mid-forties during June and July 2016, Reef believes they are likely to remain volatile, and commodity prices will have a significant impact on the Partnership s future results of operations. The Partnership has not and is currently not engaged in commodity futures trading, hedging activities, or derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. The Partnership sells substantially all of its production from successful oil and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at current spot market prices. Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk for the volatility in commodity prices inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, and the level of commodity prices has a significant impact on the Partnership s results of operations.

  Lease operating expenses decreased from $1,122,520 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to $125,214 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the Partnership s divestiture of properties. Lease operating expenses on the Thums Long Beach Unit and the Slaughter Dean acquisition properties, which were sold in 2015, totaled $737,371, or 65.7%, of the $1,122,520 in lease operating expense incurred during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. As a result of property sales made to date, and expected continued property sales as the Partnership moves to wind up operations and terminate, the Partnership s sales revenues are not sufficient to satisfy both operating and general and administrative costs.  
     
  General and administrative costs decreased from $454,863 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to $211,454 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The allocation of RELP s overhead to the Partnership is a significant portion of general and administrative expenses. The allocation of RELP s overhead to partnerships is based upon several factors, including the level of drilling activity, revenues, and capital and operating expenditures of each partnership compared to the total levels of all partnerships. As properties are sold and the Partnership s operations wind down, its overhead allocation has decreased accordingly. The administrative overhead charged to the Partnership decreased from $275,005 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to $62,326 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. In addition, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership incurred third party engineering costs of approximately $25,000.
