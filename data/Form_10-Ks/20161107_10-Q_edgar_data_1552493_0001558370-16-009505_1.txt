NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

CNH Industrial Capital LLC and its primary operating subsidiaries, including New Holland Credit Company, LLC ( New Holland Credit ), CNH Industrial Capital America LLC ( CNH Industrial Capital America ), and CNH Industrial Capital Canada Ltd. ( CNH Industrial Capital Canada ) (collectively,  CNH Industrial Capital  or the  Company ), are each a subsidiary of CNH Industrial America LLC ( CNH Industrial America ), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V. ( CNHI  and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  CNH Industrial ). CNH Industrial America and CNH Industrial Canada Ltd. (collectively,  CNH Industrial North America ) design, manufacture, and sell agricultural and construction equipment. CNH Industrial Capital provides financial services for CNH Industrial North America dealers and end-use customers primarily located in the United States and Canada.  

CNHI is incorporated in and under the laws of The Netherlands. CNHI has its corporate seat in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and its principal office in London, England. The common shares of CNHI are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  CNHI,  as well as on the Mercato Telematico Azionario managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.  

The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, which should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of our interim unaudited financial statements have been reflected.  

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company s subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and reflect the noncontrolling interests of the minority owners of the subsidiaries that are not fully owned for the periods presented, as applicable. A controlling financial interest may exist based on ownership of a majority of the voting interest of a subsidiary, or based on the Company s determination that it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ( VIE ). The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis, as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The consolidated status of the VIEs with which the Company is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.  

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include the allowance for credit losses and residual values of equipment on operating leases. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

NOTE 2: NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2016 

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02, Consolidation ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies and securitized structures. The new standard eliminates the previous deferral in Accounting Standards Codification 810, which allowed reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds to follow previously issued consolidations guidance, and makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. ASU 2015-02 has been adopted and did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 is intended to simplify the presentation of debt

(Unaudited) 

issuance costs. The new standard requires the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was retrospectively adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. As a result, $37,155 of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 was reclassified from other assets to long-term debt.  

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   ( ASU 2015-15 ), which amends ASC 835-30, Interest-Imputation of Interest. ASU 2015-15 clarifies the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. These costs may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. ASU 2015-15 has been adopted and did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  , which clarifies the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which amends ASU 2014-09. This ASU clarifies the requirement to assess collectability of contract consideration, clarifies the treatment of noncash consideration and provides a policy election to exclude from revenue amounts collected from customers for sales and similar taxes. These related ASU s have the same effective date and the same implementation requirements as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the method of adoption it will elect and the impact of the adoption of these revenue recognition updates on its financial position and results of operations.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements. An entity must also provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial doubt  about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). The purpose of this update is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users with more decision-useful information. Accordingly, ASU 2016-01 updates and revises various requirements, including measurement of equity investments at fair value with changes recognized in net income (except equity method or consolidated investees), which supersedes the current guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (e.g., trading or available for sale). It also requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (e.g. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet and in the accompanying notes. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its financial position and results of operations.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which relates to the accounting of leasing transactions. This standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 also will require disclosures

designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach and provides certain optional transition relief. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial position and results of operations.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ( ASU 2016-05 ) and ASU No. 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments   ( ASU 2016-06 ). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require designation of that hedging relationship if all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-06 clarifies the steps required to determine bifurcation of an embedded derivative. These standards will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-05 and ASU 2016-06 on its financial position and results of operations.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU 2016-13 ).  The purpose of this standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Entities will be required to utilize a forward-looking model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses under current guidance. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 on a modified-retrospective basis, and may be early adopted as of December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its financial position and results of operations.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). This standard provides guidance clarification to reduce diversity in classification of certain cash flow payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a retrospective transition basis to each period presented, and may be early adopted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 3: ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 

Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) is comprised of net income and other adjustments, including foreign currency translation adjustments, pension plan adjustments, changes in fair value of the retained interests in the off-book retail transactions and changes in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges. The Company does not provide income taxes on currency translation adjustments ( CTA ), as the historical earnings from the Company s foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. If current year earnings are repatriated, the amount to be repatriated is determined in U.S. dollars and converted to the equivalent amount of foreign currency at the time of repatriation; therefore, the repatriation of current year earnings will not have an impact on the CTA component of the Company s AOCI balance.

Restricted Receivables and Securitization 

As part of its overall funding strategy, the Company periodically transfers certain receivables into VIEs that are special purpose entities ( SPEs ) as part of its asset-backed securitization programs.  

SPEs utilized in the securitization programs differ from other entities included in the Company s consolidated financial statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated from the Company s assets. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, the Company has sold the receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal entities. Upon transfer of the receivables to the SPEs, the receivables and certain cash flows derived from them become restricted for use in meeting obligations to the SPEs  creditors. The SPEs have ownership of cash balances that also have restrictions for the benefit of the SPEs  investors. The Company s interests in the SPEs  receivables are subordinate to the interests of third-party investors. None of the receivables that are directly or indirectly sold or transferred in any of these transactions are available to pay the Company s creditors until all obligations of the SPE have been fulfilled or the receivables are removed from the SPE.  

The secured borrowings related to the restricted receivables are obligations that are payable as the receivables are collected. The following table summarizes the restricted receivables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Within the U.S. retail receivables securitization programs, qualifying retail receivables are sold to limited purpose, bankruptcy remote SPEs. In turn, these SPEs establish separate trusts to which the receivables are transferred in exchange for proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the trusts. In Canada, the receivables are transferred directly to the trusts. These trusts were determined to be VIEs. In its role as servicer, CNH Industrial Capital has the power to direct the trusts  activities. Through its retained interests, the Company has an obligation to absorb certain losses, or the right to receive certain benefits, that could potentially be significant to the trusts. Consequently, the Company has consolidated these retail trusts.  

With regard to the wholesale receivable securitization programs, the Company sells eligible receivables on a revolving basis to structured master trust facilities, which are limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote SPEs. These trusts were determined to be VIEs. In its role as servicer, CNH Industrial Capital has the power to direct the trusts  activities. Through its retained interests, the Company provides security to investors in the event that cash collections from the receivables are not sufficient to make principal and interest payments on the securities. Consequently, CNH Industrial Capital has consolidated these wholesale trusts.  

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is the Company s estimate of losses for receivables owned by the Company and consists of two components, depending on whether the receivable has been individually identified as being impaired. The first component of the allowance for credit losses covers the receivables specifically reviewed by management for which the Company has determined it is probable that it will not collect all the principal and interest payments as per the terms of the contract. Receivables are individually reviewed for impairment based on, among other items, amounts outstanding, days past due and prior collection history. These receivables are subject to impairment measurement at the loan level based either on the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables  effective interest rate.  

The second component of the allowance for credit losses covers all receivables that have not been individually reviewed for impairment. The allowance for these receivables is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by financial product. The allowance for retail and wholesale credit losses is based on loss forecast models that consider a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience, collateral value, portfolio balance and

(Unaudited) 

delinquency. The loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis. In addition, qualitative factors that are not fully captured in the loss forecast models, including industry trends, and macroeconomic factors are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.  

Charge-offs of principal amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is determined that all amounts due will not be collected.  

The Company s allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments: retail and wholesale. A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. The retail segment includes retail notes and finance lease receivables. The wholesale segment includes wholesale financing to CNH Industrial North America dealers.   

Further, the Company evaluates its portfolio segments by class of receivable: United States and Canada. Typically, the Company s receivables within a geographic area have similar risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring risk. These classes align with management reporting.

Utilizing an internal credit scoring model, which considers customers  attributes, prior credit history and each retail transaction s attributes, the Company assigns a credit quality rating to each retail customer, by specific transaction, as part of the retail underwriting process. This rating is used in setting the terms on the transaction, including the interest rate. A description of the general characteristics of the customers  risk grades is as follows: 

Titanium   Customers from whom the Company expects no collection or loss activity. 

Platinum   Customers from whom the Company expects minimal, if any, collection or loss activity. 

Gold, Silver, Bronze   Customers defined as those with the potential for collection or loss activity. 

A breakdown of the retail portfolio by the customer s risk grade at the time of origination as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows:

As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the wholesale portfolio, the Company utilizes an internal credit-scoring model that assigns a risk grade for each dealer. The scoring model considers the strength of the dealer s financial condition and payment history. The Company considers the dealers  ratings in the quarterly credit allowance analysis. A description of the general characteristics of the dealer risk grades is as follows:  

Grades A and B     Includes receivables due from dealers that have significant capital strength, moderate leverage, stable earnings and growth, and excellent payment performance. 

Grade C     Includes receivables due from dealers with moderate credit risk. Dealers of this grade are differentiated from higher grades on a basis of leverage or payment performance. 

Grade D     Includes receivables due from dealers with additional credit risk. These dealers require additional monitoring due to their weaker financial condition or payment performance. 

A breakdown of the wholesale portfolio by its credit quality indicators as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows:  

The following tables present information at the level at which management assesses and monitors its credit risk. Receivables are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Delinquency is reported on receivables greater than 30 days past due.

Recognition of income is generally suspended when management determines that collection of future finance income is not probable or when an account becomes 120 days delinquent, whichever occurs first. Interest accrual is resumed if the receivable becomes contractually current and collection becomes probable. Previously suspended income is recognized at that time. The receivables on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

A restructuring of a receivable constitutes a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) when the lender grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. As a collateral-based lender, the Company typically will repossess collateral in lieu of restructuring receivables. As such, for retail receivables, concessions are typically provided based on bankruptcy court proceedings. For wholesale receivables, concessions granted may include extended contract maturities, inclusion of interest-only periods, modification of a contractual interest rate to a below market interest rate and waiving of interest and principal.  

TDRs are reviewed along with other receivables as part of management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses attributable to TDRs is based on the most probable source of repayment, which is normally the liquidation of collateral. In determining collateral value, the Company estimates the current fair market value of the equipment collateral and considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and third-party guarantees.

Before removing a receivable from TDR classification, a review of the borrower is conducted. If concerns exist about the future ability of the borrower to meet its obligations based on a credit review, the TDR classification is not removed from the receivable.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 807 retail and finance lease receivable contracts classified as TDRs, of which the pre-modification value was $37,658 and the post-modification value was $36,532. A court has determined the concession in 245 of these cases. The pre-modification value of these contracts was $4,050 and the post-modification value was $3,404. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately 598 retail and finance lease receivable contracts classified as TDRs, of which the pre-modification value was $20,040 and the post-modification value was $18,858. A court has determined the concession in 302 of these cases. The pre-modification value of these contracts was $5,113 and the post-modification value was $4,302. As the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is determined by a court based on available assets, subsequent re-defaults are unusual and were not material for retail and finance lease contracts that were modified in a TDR during the previous 12 months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s wholesale TDRs were immaterial.  

NOTE 5: DEBT 

On August 15, 2016, the Company repaid its U.S. wholesale term ABS of $367,300.  

On September 21, 2016, the Company, through a bankruptcy-remote trust, issued $752,360 of amortizing asset-backed notes secured by U.S. retail loan contracts.  

On September 30, 2016, the Company extended the maturity date of the $1,200,000 U.S. retail committed asset-backed facility to September 28, 2018.   

NOTE 6: INCOME TAXES 

The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 31.7% and 32.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was 32.4% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to 34.0% for the same period in 2015. The Company s provision for income taxes is based on an estimated tax rate for the year applied to the year-to-date federal, state and foreign income. The 2016 estimated annual tax rate is expected to be lower than the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% primarily due to profits in tax jurisdictions with lower rates, including Canada.  

NOTE 7: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This fair value option must be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings. The election can be made at the acquisition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability, or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election may not be revoked once made. The Company did not elect the fair value measurement option for eligible items.

Fair-Value Hierarchy 

U.S. GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s internally-developed market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy:  

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 

Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. 

Level 3   Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.  

Determination of Fair Value 

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items in Level 1. In some cases where a market price is not available, the Company will make use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the items are classified in Level 2.  

If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates, currency rates, or yield curves. Items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.  

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes details of the valuation models and the key inputs to those models, as well as any significant assumptions.  

Derivatives 

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivatives used as hedges are effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. The Company does not hold or issue derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes. The credit risk for the interest rate hedges is reduced through diversification among counterparties, utilizing mandatory termination clauses and/or collateral support agreements. Derivative instruments are generally classified in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The cash flows underlying all derivative contracts were recorded in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  

Interest Rate Derivatives 

The Company has entered into interest rate derivatives in order to manage interest rate exposures arising in the normal course of business. Interest rate derivatives that have been designated in cash flow hedging relationships are being used by the Company to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates related to debt and anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt in future periods. Gains and losses on these instruments, to the extent that the hedge relationship has been effective, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in interest expense over the period in which the Company recognizes interest expense on the related debt. Ineffectiveness recognized related to these hedging relationships was not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These amounts are recorded in  Other expenses  in the consolidated statements of income. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedge

relationships is 45 months. The after-tax losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that will be recognized in interest expense over the next 12 months are approximately $505.  

The Company also enters into interest rate derivatives with substantially similar economic terms that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk related to the Company s committed asset-backed facilities. These facilities require the Company to enter into interest rate derivatives. To ensure that these transactions do not result in the Company being exposed to this risk, the Company enters into an offsetting position. Unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes in these instruments are recognized directly in income and were insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Most of the Company s interest rate derivatives are considered Level 2. The fair market value of these derivatives is calculated using market data input for forecasted benchmark interest rates and can be compared to actively traded derivatives. If the future notional amount of the Company s interest rate derivatives is not known in advance, the derivatives are considered Level 3 derivatives. The fair market value of these derivatives is calculated using market data input and a forecasted future notional balance. The total notional amount of the Company s interest rate derivatives was approximately $3,087,040 and $2,840,821 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The ten-month average notional amounts as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,138,854 and $2,938,845, respectively.  

Foreign Exchange Contracts 

The Company uses forward contracts to hedge certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Such derivatives are considered economic hedges and are not designated as hedging instruments. The changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized directly as income in  Other expenses  and are expected to offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the exposures being managed.  

All of the Company s foreign exchange derivatives are considered Level 2 as the fair value is calculated using market data input and can be compared to actively traded derivatives.  

Financial Statement Impact of the Company s Derivatives 

The fair values of the Company s derivatives as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded as follows:

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of which are classified as Level 2:  

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 hierarchy levels during the periods presented.  

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, floating-rate affiliated accounts and notes receivable, floating-rate short-term debt, interest payable and short-term affiliated debt was assumed to approximate its fair value. Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified as Level 1 and the remainder of the financial instruments listed are classified as Level 2.

*    Under the fair value hierarchy, receivables measurements are classified as Level 3 and long term debt measurements are classified as Level 2. 

Financial Assets 

The fair value of receivables was determined by discounting the estimated future payments using a discount rate, which includes an estimate for credit risk.  

Financial Liabilities 

The fair values of long-term debt were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Overview 

Organization 

We offer a range of financial products and services to the dealers and customers of CNH Industrial North America. The principal products offered are retail financing for the purchase or lease of new and used CNH Industrial North America equipment and wholesale financing to CNH Industrial North America dealers. Wholesale financing consists primarily of floor plan financing, as well as financing equipment used in dealer owned rental yards, parts inventory and working capital needs. In addition, we purchase equipment from dealers that are leased to retail customers under operating lease agreements.  

Trends and Economic Conditions 

Our business is closely related to the agricultural and construction equipment industries because we offer financing products for such equipment. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, CNH Industrial s net sales of agricultural equipment and net sales of construction equipment generated in NAFTA were $888 million and $316 million, respectively, representing decreases of 7% and 3% from the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, CNH Industrial s net sales of agricultural equipment and net sales of construction equipment generated in NAFTA were $2,649 million and $920 million, respectively, representing decreases of 19% and 14% from the same period in 2015.  

In general, our receivable mix between agricultural and construction equipment financing directionally reflects the mix of equipment sales by CNH Industrial North America. As such, changes in the agricultural industry or with respect to our agricultural equipment borrowers may affect the majority of our portfolio.  

Net income attributable to CNH Industrial Capital LLC was $45.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $54.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher depreciation costs associated with the operating lease portfolio, partially offset by a lower tax rate. Net income attributable to CNH Industrial Capital LLC was $149.0 million and $166.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to higher depreciation costs associated with the operating lease portfolio, partially offset by a lower tax rate. The receivables balance greater than 30 days past due as a percentage of managed receivables was 0.7%, 0.6% and 0.5% at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Macroeconomic issues for us include the uncertainty of governmental actions in respect to monetary, fiscal and legislative policies, the global economic recovery, capital market disruptions, trade agreements and financial regulatory reform. Significant volatility in the price of certain commodities could also impact CNH Industrial North America s and our results.

Results of Operations 

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues 

Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Revenues totaled $237.0 million and $711.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $237.0 million and $697.1 million for the same periods in 2015. A higher average operating lease portfolio primarily drove the year over year increase. The average yield for the managed portfolio was 7.0% and 6.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 6.9% and 6.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Interest income on retail notes and finance leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $52.8 million and $159.6 million, respectively, representing a decrease of $2.2 million and an increase of $2.4 million from the same periods in 2015. For the third quarter, the decrease was primarily due to a $4.2 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, partially offset by a $2.0 million favorable impact from higher interest rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, the increase was due to a $14.3 million favorable impact from higher interest rates, partially offset by a $11.9 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets.  

Interest income on wholesale notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18.2 million and $51.7 million, representing decreases of $0.7 million and $6.6 million from the same periods in 2015. The decreases were primarily due to the unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets.  

Interest and other income from affiliates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $98.1 million and $300.8 million, respectively, compared to $100.6 million and $306.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compensation from CNH Industrial North America for retail low rate financing programs and interest waiver programs offered to customers was $41.4 million and $130.1 million, respectively, a decrease of $5.9 million and $16.7 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower originations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compensation from CNH Industrial North America for wholesale marketing programs was $39.0 million and $117.3 million, respectively, an increase of $1.7 million and $5.3 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively. For select operating leases, compensation from CNH Industrial North America for the difference between market rental rates and the amounts paid by customers was $17.4 million and $52.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.3 million and $5.0 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively. The increases were primarily due to a higher average portfolio.

Rental income on operating leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $61.1 million and $180.6 million, representing an increase of $6.0 million and $24.5 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher average earning assets.  

Other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.7 million and $18.9 million, respectively, representing a decrease of $0.6 million and $0.4 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively.  

Expenses 

Expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Interest expense totaled $77.4 million and $228.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $73.1 million and $219.3 million for the same periods in 2015. For the third quarter, the increase was due to a $7.8 million unfavorable impact from higher average interest rates, partially offset by a $3.6 million favorable impact from lower average total debt. For the nine months, the increase was due primarily to a $19.8 million unfavorable impact from higher average interest rates, partially offset by a $10.7 million favorable impact from lower average total debt.  

The provision for credit losses was $6.8 million and $20.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $6.4 million and $17.5 million for the same periods in 2015. The increases in 2016 were primarily due to retail write offs.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation of equipment on operating leases was $62.2 million and $179.6 million, respectively, an increase of $12.6 million and $39.3 million from the same periods in 2015, respectively, primarily due to a higher operating lease portfolio and updated depreciation estimates.  

Other expenses decreased by $1.1 million and $2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to lower losses on equipment held for sale.  

The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 31.7% and 32.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was 32.4% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to 34.0% for the same period in 2015. The decreases in the effective tax rates were primarily due to profits in tax jurisdictions with lower rates, including Canada.

Receivables and Equipment on Operating Leases Originated and Held 

Receivables and equipment on operating lease originations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Retail, wholesale and equipment on operating lease originations decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of CNH Industrial North America equipment.  

Total receivables and equipment on operating leases held as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

The total retail receivables balance over 30 days past due as a percentage of the retail receivables was 1.0%, 0.9% and 0.8% at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. At those same dates, the total wholesale receivables balance over 30 days past due as a percentage of the wholesale receivables was not significant. Total retail receivables on nonaccrual status, which represent receivables for which we have ceased accruing finance income, were $47.9 million, $54.0 million and $38.5 million at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Total wholesale receivables on nonaccrual status were $44.8 million, $81.7 million and $62.5 million at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Total receivable write off amounts and recoveries, by product, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Our allowance for credit losses on all receivables financed totaled $85.7 million at September 30, 2016, $94.7 million at December 31, 2015 and $96.7 million at September 30, 2015. The level of the allowance is based on quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions, collateral value and credit risk quality. We believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses in our receivable portfolio as of September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources principally focuses on our statements of cash flows, balance sheets and capitalization. CNH Industrial Capital s current funding strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments and funding options.  

In the past, securitization has been one of our most economical sources of funding and, therefore, the majority of our originated receivables are securitized, with the cash generated from such receivables utilized to repay the related debt or, in the case of wholesale receivables, to purchase new receivables. We expect securitization to continue to represent a substantial portion of our liquidity plan.  

In addition, we have committed secured and unsecured facilities, unsecured bonds, affiliate borrowings and cash to fund our liquidity needs. We have accessed the unsecured bond market in order to add more diversity to our funding sources. As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding unsecured senior notes totaled $3.8 billion. We expect continued changes to our funding profile, with less reliance on the securitization market.  

Cash Flows 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our cash flows were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 generated cash of $453 million, resulting primarily from net income of $149 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization of $181 million, deferred income tax expense of $27 million and cash from changes in working capital of $75 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a $20 million improvement in cash from working capital, a $40 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $18 million decrease in net income and a $12 million decrease in deferred income tax expense.  

41 

Table of Contents  

Investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 generated cash of $551 million, resulting primarily from a net reduction in receivables of $551 million and a decrease in restricted cash of $231 million, partially offset by $231 million in net expenditures for equipment on operating leases. The increase in cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a $245 million reduction in net expenditures for equipment on operating leases and a $21 million increase in restricted cash, partially offset by a $56 million lower reduction in receivables.  

Financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 used cash of $1,091 million, resulting primarily from net cash paid on affiliated debt of $18 million, $412 million from net cash paid on long term debt, $436 million from net cash paid on short term borrowings and a $225 million dividend paid to CNH Industrial America. The increase in cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a $678 million decrease in short-term borrowings, a $516 million reduction in net cash received on long-term debt and higher dividends of $110 million paid to CNH Industrial America, partially offset by a decrease of $844 million in net cash paid on affiliated debt and the $60 million redemption of preferred stock of a subsidiary in 2015.  

Securitization 

CNH Industrial Capital and its predecessor entities have been securitizing receivables since 1992. Because this market generally remains a cost effective financing source and allows access to a wide investor base, we expect to continue utilizing securitization as one of our core sources of funding in the near future. CNH Industrial Capital has completed public and private issuances of asset backed securities in both the U.S. and Canada and, as of September 30, 2016, the amounts outstanding were approximately $6.6 billion. Our securitizations are treated as financing arrangements for accounting purposes.  

Committed Asset Backed Facilities 

CNH Industrial Capital has committed asset backed facilities with several banks or through their commercial paper conduit programs. Committed asset backed facilities for the U.S. and Canada totaled $2.8 billion at September 30, 2016, with original borrowing maturities of up to two years. The unused availability under the facilities varies during the year, depending on origination volume and the refinancing of receivables with term securitization transactions and/or other financing. At September 30, 2016, approximately $1.3 billion of funding was available for use under these facilities.  

Unsecured Funding 

As of September 30, 2016, our outstanding unsecured senior notes were as follows (dollars in thousands):  

(1) 

Includes fair value adjustment.     

(2) 

Includes unamortized debt discount.     

On October 21, 2016, we completed an offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% unsecured notes due 2021, issued at a price of 99.441%.  

On November 1, 2016, we repaid $500 million of our 6.250% unsecured notes.  

These notes, which are senior unsecured obligations of CNH Industrial Capital LLC, are guaranteed by CNH Industrial Capital America and New Holland Credit.  

As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding a $100 million unsecured term loan with a final maturity in March 2018. Additionally, we had undrawn, unsecured revolving credit facilities of $100 million with a final maturity in March 2019 and $300 million with a consortium of banks, with a final maturity in June 2019.

Table of Contents  

Affiliate Sources 

CNH Industrial Capital borrows, as needed, from CNH Industrial. This source of funding is primarily used to finance various assets and provides additional flexibility when evaluating market conditions and potential third party financing options. We have obtained financing from CNHI treasury subsidiaries and, from time to time, have entered into term loan agreements. We had affiliated debt of $5 million and $23 million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Equity Position 

Our equity position also supports our ability to access various funding sources. Our stockholder s equity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.  

During 2016, CNH Industrial Capital LLC paid cash dividends of $225 million to CNH Industrial America.  

Liquidity 

The majority of CNH Industrial Capital s debt is self-liquidating from the cash generated by the underlying receivables. Normally, additional liquidity should not be necessary for the repayment of such debt. New originations of retail receivables are usually warehoused in committed asset-backed facilities until being refinanced in the term ABS market or with other third party debt. The majority of new wholesale receivables are financed through a master trust and funded by variable funding notes.   

Our liquidity available for use as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands):  

The liquidity available for use varies due to changes in origination volumes, reflecting the financing needs of our customers, and is influenced by the timing of any refinancing of underlying receivables.  

In connection with a limited number of funding transactions, we provide financial guarantees to various parties on behalf of certain foreign financial services subsidiaries of CNHI for approximately $256.7 million as of September 30, 2016. The guarantees are in effect for the term of the underlying funding facilities plus 365 days. The underlying facilities are renewable annually.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

See our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 under the caption  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in such annual report. There were no material changes to these policies or estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2016 

In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015 02,   Consolidation   ( ASU 2015 02 ). ASU 2015 02 is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies and securitized structures. The new standard eliminates the previous deferral in Accounting Standards Codification 810, which allowed reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds to follow previously issued consolidations guidance, and makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. ASU 2015 02 has been adopted and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 03,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835 30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015 03 ). ASU 2015 03 is intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new standard requires the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015 03 was retrospectively adopted by us on January 1, 2016. As a result, $37 million of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 was reclassified from other assets to long term debt. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015 15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line of Credit Arrangements   ( ASU 2015 15 ), which amends ASC 835 30, Interest Imputation of Interest. ASU 2015 15 clarifies the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. These costs may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. ASU 2015 15 has been adopted and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014 09 ). ASU 2014 09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605   Revenue Recognition   and most industry specific guidance throughout the Codification. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015 14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014 09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  , which clarifies the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014 09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance in ASU 2014 09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 12,   Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which amends ASU 2014 09. This ASU clarifies the requirement to assess collectability of contract consideration, clarifies the treatment of noncash consideration and provides a policy election to exclude from revenue amounts collected from customers for sales and similar taxes. These related ASU s have the same effective date and the same implementation requirements as ASU 2014 09. We are currently assessing the method

of adoption we will elect and the impact of the adoption of these revenue recognition updates on our financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 15,   Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014 15 ). ASU 2014 15 provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements. An entity must also provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial doubt  about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014 15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825 10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016 01 ). The purpose of this update is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users with more decision useful information. Accordingly, ASU 2016 01 updates and revises various requirements, including measurement of equity investments at fair value with changes recognized in net income (except equity method or consolidated investees), which supersedes the current guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (e.g., trading or available for sale). It also requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (e.g. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet and in the accompanying notes. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 01 on our financial position and results of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016 02 ), which relates to the accounting of leasing transactions. This standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016 02 also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years, but early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016 02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach and provides certain optional transition relief. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 02 on our financial position and results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ( ASU 2016 05 ) and ASU No. 2016 06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments   ( ASU 2016 06 ). ASU 2016 05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require designation of that hedging relationship if all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016 06 clarifies the steps required to determine bifurcation of an embedded derivative. These standards will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 05 and ASU 2016 06 on our financial position and results of operations. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU 2016 13 ). The purpose of this standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Entities will be required to utilize a forward looking model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses under current guidance. ASU 2016 13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis, and may be early adopted as of December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016 13 on our financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). This standard provides guidance clarification to reduce diversity in classification of certain cash flow payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 on a retrospective transition basis to each period presented, and may be early adopted. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
