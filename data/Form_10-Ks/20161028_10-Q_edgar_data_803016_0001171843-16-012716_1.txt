Forward-Looking
Statements   

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future consolidated results of operations, business
and growth strategies, financing plans, our competitive position and the effects of competition. Forward-looking statements include
all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by forward-looking words such as  anticipate ,  believe ,
 could ,  estimate ,  expect ,  intend ,  plan ,  may ,
 should ,  will ,  would ,  project  and similar expressions. These forward-looking
statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and certain
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Particular uncertainties arise from the behavior
of financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and securities prices, from unanticipated changes in the risk characteristics
of the lease and loan portfolio, the level of defaults and a change in the provision for credit losses, and from numerous other
matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive or regulatory nature.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking
statements. Management does not undertake to update our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising
after the date on which they are made.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1- BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of
California First National Bancorp (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries California First National Bank ( CalFirst
Bank  or the  Bank ) and California First Leasing Corporation ( CalFirst Leasing ) have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The
material under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
is written with the presumption that the readers have read or have access to the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of June 30, 2016 and for the year
then ended. 

In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial
statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated
balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders 
equity for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending
June 30, 2017. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the fiscal 2016 financial
statements to conform to the presentation of the fiscal 2017 financial statements. 

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 addresses diversity in how certain
cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public
business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other
entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating
the impact of this new requirement on the cash flows of the Company. 

NOTE 3   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

At September 30, 2016, the Company has one stock option plan, which
is more fully described in Note 14 in the Company s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to ASC Topic 718,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ), compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period
using the fair-value based method for all new awards calculated at the grant date. 

During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $1,100 in each respective quarter. Such expense related to options granted
during fiscal 2013. The Company has not awarded any new grants in fiscal 2017 and has calculated the stock-based compensation
expense based upon the original grant date fair value as allowed under ASC 718. The valuation variables utilized at the grant
dates are discussed in the Company s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $3,700 of
total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested shares is expected to be recognized over the next 10 months. 

Stock option activity for the periods indicated is summarized in
the following table: 

Stock options outstanding and exercisable are summarized below: 

NOTE 4   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:   

ASC Topic 820:  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tiered
value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs based on the extent to which inputs used are observable in the market and requires the
Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  If a value is based on
inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value calculation. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: 

Level
1 - Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets;   

        Level
2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments
in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the
market;   

        Level
3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use inputs not observable in the market and based on the entity s
own judgment. Level 3 valuation techniques could include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques, and rely on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   

ASC 820 applies whenever other accounting pronouncements require
presentation of fair value measurements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at
fair value. As such, ASC 820 does not apply to the Company s investment in leases. The Company s financial assets measured
at fair value on a recurring basis include primarily securities available-for-sale and at September 30, 2016, there were no liabilities
subject to ASC 820. 

Securities available-for-sale include U.S. Treasury Notes, corporate
bonds, U.S. government agency ( Agency ) mortgaged-backed securities ( MBS ), and a mutual fund investment
and generally are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The fair value of corporate bonds and the Agency
MBS are obtained from independent quotation bureaus that use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values based
on observable transactions, but not a quoted bid, or are valued using prices obtained from the custodian, who uses third party
data service providers (Level 2 input). U.S. Treasury Notes and the mutual fund are valued by reference to the market closing or
last trade price (Level 1 inputs). In the unlikely event that no trade occurred on the applicable date, an indicative bid or the
last trade most proximate to the applicable date would be used (Level 2 input). 

The following table summarizes the Company s assets, which
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016: 

Certain financial assets, such as collateral dependent impaired
loans and repossessed or returned assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured
at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. During the year ended
June 30, 2016, the equipment subject to a lease rejected in bankruptcy was transferred from lease receivables and recorded as repossessed
equipment in other assets. 

The fair value of repossessed equipment is based on available market
information, including independent appraisal and sales results, less estimated selling costs. The equipment repossessed was initially
recorded at the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of transfer to repossessed assets and subsequently
written down based on an updated appraisal. 

The following table summarizes the Company s assets which
are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

NOTE 5   FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:   

In accordance with ASC 825-50, the following table summarizes the
estimated fair value of financial instruments as of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, and includes financial instruments
that are not accounted for or carried at fair value. In accordance with disclosure guidance, certain financial instruments, including
all lease related assets and liabilities and all non-financial instruments are excluded from fair value of financial instrument
disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate of the fair values presented does not represent the total underlying value
of the Company. These fair value estimates are based on relevant market information and data, however, given there is no active
market or observable market transactions for certain financial instruments, the Company has made estimates of fair values which
are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. 
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimated values. 

For cash and cash equivalents and demand and savings deposits, because
of their short-term nature, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Values for investments and available-for-sale securities are determined as set forth in Note 4, 6 and 7. The fair values of loan
participations that trade regularly in the secondary market are based upon current bid prices in such market at the measurement
date and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. For other loans, the estimated fair value is calculated based on
discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar
credit quality and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These calculations have been adjusted for credit risk
based on the Company s historical credit loss experience. The fair value of certificates of deposit and short-term borrowings
are estimated based on discounted cash flows using current offered market rates or interest rates for borrowings of similar maturity
and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows: 

NOTE 6   INVESTMENTS:  

Investments are carried at cost and consist of the following: 

The investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB )
stock is a required investment related to CalFirst Bank s borrowing relationship with the FHLB. The FHLB obtains its funding
primarily through issuance of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The U.S. Government does not guarantee
these obligations, and each of the twelve FHLB s are generally jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s
debt. Therefore, the Company s investment could be adversely impacted by the financial operations of the FHLB and actions
by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. These investments have no stated maturity. 

CalFirst Bank is required to hold Federal Reserve Bank stock equal
to 6% of its capital surplus, which is defined as additional paid-in capital stock, less any gains (losses) on available for sale
securities as of the current period end. 

The mortgage-backed investment consists of one U.S. agency issued
security. The Company has determined that it has the ability to hold this investment until maturity and, given the Company s
intent to do so, anticipates that it will realize the full carrying value of its investment and carries the security at amortized
cost. 

NOTE 7   SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE : 

The amortized cost, fair value, and carrying value of securities
were as follows: 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale
securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities
because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
no realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company
realized a gain of $23,000 from an early call of a corporate debt security for proceeds of $4.8 million. There were no available-for-sale
securities in a gross unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016. The following table presents the fair value and associated
gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2016. 

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment portfolios to determine whether any securities
are other-than-temporarily impaired. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other factors,
length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the
issuer, the intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery and whether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized
cost basis. 

At September 30, 2016 and at June 30, 2016, U.S. Treasury notes
and Agency MBS with an amortized cost of $77.3 million and $79.1 million, respectively, were pledged to secure borrowings from
the FHLB (see Note 11). 

NOTE 8   NET INVESTMENT IN LEASES   

The Company's net investment in leases consists of the following: 

The minimum lease payments receivable and estimated residual value
are discounted using the internal rate of return method related to each specific capital lease. Unearned income includes the offset
of initial direct costs of $2.6 million at September 30, 2016 and at June 30, 2016. 

NOTE 9   COMMERCIAL LOANS  

The Company s investment in commercial loans consists of the
following: 

Commercial loans are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal
balances reduced by the allowance for loan losses and net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, or unamortized premiums
or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees and certain
direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related commercial loan. 

In addition to the amount outstanding on revolving lines of credit
set forth above, the Company had additional unused commitments on revolving lines of credit in the amount of $2.0 million at September
30, 2016 and $524,000 at June 30, 2016. The Company has a recorded liability for unfunded loan commitments of $50,000 at September
30, 2016 and at June 30, 2016 related to such commitments. 

NOTE 10   CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE
FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

The following tables provide information on the credit profile of
the components of the portfolio and allowance for credit losses related to  financing receivables  as defined under
ASC Topic 310, Receivables.  This disclosure on  financing receivables  covers the Company s direct
finance and sales-type leases and all commercial loans, but does not include operating leases and transactions in process.  
The portfolio is disaggregated into segments and classifications appropriate for assessing and monitoring the portfolios 
risk and performance. This disclosure does not encompass all risk assets or the entire allowance for credit losses. 

Portfolio segments identified by the Company include leases and
loans. These segments have been disaggregated into four classes: 1) commercial leases, 2) education, government and non-profit
leases, 3) commercial and industrial loans and 4) commercial real estate loans. Relevant risk characteristics for establishing
these portfolio classes generally include the nature of the borrower, structure of the transaction and collateral type. The Company s
credit process includes a policy of classifying all leases and loans in accordance with a risk rating classification system consistent
with regulatory models under which leases and loans may be rated as  pass ,  special mention ,  substandard ,
or  doubtful . These risk categories reflect an assessment of the ability of the borrowers to service their obligation
based on current financial position, historical payment experience, and collateral adequacy, among other factors. The Company uses
the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass   Includes credits
of the highest quality as well as credits with positive primary repayment source but one or more characteristics that are of higher
than average risk. 

Special Mention   Have
a potential weakness that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the lease or loan or of
the Company s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard   Are inadequately
protected by the paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any. Substandard credits have a well-defined weakness
that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt or indicate the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the
deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful   Based on current
information and events, collection of all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the lease or loan agreement is considered
highly questionable and improbable. 

The risk classification of financing receivables by portfolio class
is as follows: 

The accrual of interest income on leases and loans will be discontinued
when the customer becomes ninety days or more past due on its lease or loan payments with the Company, unless the Company believes
the investment is otherwise recoverable. Leases and loans may be placed on non-accrual earlier if the Company has significant doubt
about the ability of the customer to meet its lease or loan obligations, as evidenced by consistent delinquency, deterioration
in the customer s financial condition or other relevant factors. Payments received while on non-accrual are applied to reduce
the Company s recorded value. 

The following table presents the aging of the financing receivables
by portfolio class: 

The allowance balances and activity in the allowance related to
financing receivables by portfolio segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are presented in
the following table: 

The following table presents the recorded investment in loans and
leases and the related allowance based on impairment method as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 by portfolio segment. 

NOTE 11   BORROWINGS  

CalFirst Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
and can take advantage of FHLB programs for overnight and term advances at published daily rates. Under terms of a blanket collateral
agreement, advances from the FHLB are collateralized by qualifying real estate loans and investment securities. The Bank also has
authority to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) discount window amounts secured by certain lease receivables.
Borrowing capacity from the FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the acceptability and risk rating of securities, loan and lease
collateral and both the FRB and FHLB could adjust advance rates applied to such collateral at their discretion.  

The borrowings from the FHLB and weighted average interest rates
at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, there was available borrowing capacity from
the FHLB of $36.5 million related to qualifying real estate loans of $6.7 million and securities pledged with an amortized cost
of $77.3 million. There were no borrowings from the FRB, leaving availability of approximately $97.3 million secured by $123.9
million of lease receivables. 

NOTE 12   SEGMENT REPORTING  

The Company s two subsidiaries, CalFirst Bank, an FDIC-insured
national bank, and CalFirst Leasing are considered to be two different business segments. Below is a summary of each segment s
financial results for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

cALIFORNIA FIRST NATIONAL
BANCORP 

ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
                                                                                 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

General   

California First National Bancorp, a California
corporation (the  Company ), is a bank holding company headquartered in Orange County, California with a bank subsidiary,
California First National Bank ( CalFirst Bank  or the  Bank ) and a leasing subsidiary, California First
Leasing Corp ( CalFirst Leasing ). The primary business of the Company is secured financing provided through leasing
and financing capital assets, commercial loans acquired through participation in the syndicated commercial loan market, by providing
non-recourse loans to third parties secured by leases and equipment, and direct commercial loans. CalFirst Bank, now responsible
for substantially all lease and loan origination, has migrated from predominately leasing toward over 50% commercial loans, with
a lease and loan portfolio diversified geographically and across industries. The Bank gathers deposits through posting rates on
the Internet and conducts all banking and other operations from one central location. 

The Company s finance, loan and interest
income includes interest income earned on the Company s investment in lease receivables and residuals, commercial loans and
investment securities. Non-interest income primarily includes gains realized on the sale of leased property and leases, income
from sales-type and operating leases, gains and losses realized on investments, and other income. Income from sales-type leases
relates to the re-lease of lease property ( lease extensions ) while income from operating leases generally involves
lease extensions that are accounted for as an operating lease rather than as a sales-type lease. 

The Company's operating results are subject
to quarterly fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including the size and credit quality of the lease and loan portfolios,
the volume and profitability of leased property being re-marketed through re-lease or sale, the interest rate environment, the
market for investment securities, the volume of new lease or loan originations, including variations in the mix and funding of
such originations, and economic conditions in general. The Company s principal market risk exposure currently is related
to interest rates and the impact the interest rate environment has on its net interest margin. The Company s current balance
sheet structure is short-term in nature, with over 70% of interest-earning assets, $614.5 million, and 83% of interest bearing
liabilities, $554.9 million, repricing within one year. The Company s interest margin is susceptible to the disparate impact
of varying movements in market interest rates as many of the Company s leases, loans and liquid investments are tied to U.S.
Treasury rates and Libor that often do not move in step with bank deposit rates. As a result, this can cause a greater change in
net interest income than indicated by the repricing asset and liability comparison. 

The Company conducts its business in a manner
designed to mitigate risks. However, the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing and banking industries and
the Company is subject to risks through its leases and loans held in its own portfolio, investment securities, lease transactions
in process, and residual investments. The Company takes steps to manage risks through the implementation of strict credit management
processes and on-going risk management review procedures. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of the Company s financial
statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates that impact the stated amount of assets and liabilities
at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a reporting period. These accounting estimates
are based on management s judgment and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements
and the possibility that future events may differ from current judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result
in materially different estimates. The critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed from and should be read in conjunction
with the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The Company's estimates are reviewed continuously
to ensure reasonableness. However, the amounts the Company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts. 

Overview of Results and Trends    

The following discussion is provided in addition
to the required analysis of earnings in order to discuss trends in our business. The Company believes this analysis provides additional
meaningful information on a comparative basis. 

Net earnings for the first quarter ended September
30, 2016 of $1.96 million were up 13.6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as the result of a 16% increase in interest income
and lower provision for credit losses that was offset in part by a 50% increase in interest expense. The increased interest income
in fiscal 2017 related to a 57% increase in the average loan portfolio from September 2015 while higher interest expense reflected
higher deposit balances and rates paid. 

New loan bookings of $51.5 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 2017 were down 21.9% from $66.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while new lease bookings of
$30.5 million were up 18.8% from $25.6 million booked in the comparable quarter. Combined, total lease and loan bookings of $82.0
million were 11% below the $91.7 million booked the prior year. The net investment in leases and loans of $646.8 million at September
30, 2016 was up less than 1% from June 30, 2016 but increased 17.1% from $552.1 million at September 30, 2015. 

New lease and loan originations during the first
quarter of fiscal 2017, while 21% below the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which was an historic peak quarter for the Company, exceeded
the last three quarters of fiscal 2016. As a result, the backlog of approved lease and loan commitments of $117.4 million at September
30, 2016 is down 7% from the level of a year ago but up 31.3% from June 30, 2016. 

The Company s portfolio of investment
securities decreased 2.2% to $97.6 million at September 30, 2016 related to the payments received on certain securities and lower
unrealized gains related to rising interest rates during the period. Total assets decreased 0.5% to $884.1 million, with net worth
at $192.8 million and a common equity tier 1 capital of 24.8%. 

Consolidated Statement of Earnings Analysis

Summary --  For the first quarter ended
September 30, 2016, net earnings of $1.96 million increased $234,000, or 13.6% from $1.72 million earned during the first quarter
ended September 30, 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.19 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 15.6% from $0.16 for
the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The 2017 earnings per share benefitted from a reduction in average shares outstanding. 

Net Interest Income --  Net interest income
is the difference between interest earned on the investment in leases, loans, securities and other interest earning assets and
interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning
assets, the movement of interest rates, and funding and pricing strategies. 

The following table presents the components
of the increases (decreases) in net finance, loan and interest income before provision for credit losses by volume and rate: 

Net interest income was $5.3 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, a $349,000, or 7.0% increase compared to the same quarter of the prior year. Total interest income
for the first quarter ending September 30, 2016 increased 15.9% to $7.2 million from $6.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2016. This increase includes a $1.5 million, or 63.5%, increase in commercial loan income and a $187,900, or 39.7% increase in
investment income offset by a $664,300, or 19.2% decrease in finance income. The growth in commercial loan income reflected a 56.7%
increase in average loan balances to $405.7 million from $258.9 million, and a 15 basis point increase in average loan yield. The
decrease in finance income was due to a 21.7% decrease in average lease balances to $223.5 million that offset a 15 basis point
improvement in the average yield that benefited from accelerated finance income from early terminated leases, Without that boost,
the average lease yield in the quarter would have been down by 17 basis points. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the average
yield on cash and investments of 1.26% was unchanged from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as investments increased 20.1% to $97.1
million, but at average yields that declined 9 basis points to 2.10%, while average cash balances increased by 62.5% to $113.4
million with an average yield up 35 basis points. Interest expense paid increased 49.9% to $1.9 million, reflecting a 28.2% increase
in the average balance of deposits and borrowings to $671.3 million and a 17 basis point increase in average rate paid to 1.15%.
The increased interest cost is largely due to a 16 basis points increase in average cost of deposits to 1.20% on a $149.5 million
increase in average deposits, with the total funding cost increase tempered by a 8 basis point increase average rate of borrowings
to 0.43%. 

The following table presents the Company s
average balances, finance and loan income and interest earned or interest paid, the related yields and rates on major categories
of the Company s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Yields/rates are presented on an annualized basis. 

(1)    Average balance is based on month-end balances, includes non-accrual leases, and is
presented net of unearned income. 

(2)    Net interest spread is equal to the difference between the average yield on interest
earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 

(3)    Net interest margin represents net direct finance and interest income as a percent
of average interest earning assets. 

The average yield on all interest-earning assets
for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased to 3.45% from 3.60% for the first quarter ended September 30, 2015, while the average
rate paid on all interest-bearing liabilities increased by 17 basis points to 1.15%. As a result, the net interest margin decreased
to 2.53% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 2.85% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decline in net interest spread
and margin in fiscal 2017 is largely due to the increase in lower yielding commercial loans to 48% of average interest earning
assets from 37% during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and this is compounded by higher rates paid on deposits. The average yield
on interest earning assets can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to transaction activity in both the lease and loan portfolio. 

Provision for Credit Losses --  The Company
recorded a $300,000 provision for credit losses during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a $500,000 provision made
during the quarter ending September 30, 2015. The first quarter 2017 provision related to the growth in the loan portfolio since
June 30, 2016 while the overall credit profile of the portfolios remained stable. 

Non-interest Income --  Total
non-interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by 2.1% to $915,000 from $896,000 in the first quarter of
the prior year reflecting a 39% increase in income from end of term transactions and $240,000 decline in gains on sale of leases.
Operating and sales-type lease income related to end-of-term transactions increased by $440,600 and offset  a decline
in gains realized on the sale of leases and leased property of $454,000. 

Non-interest Expenses --  The Company s
non-interest expenses of $2.7 million reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased by $154,000 or 6.1% from $2.5
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase reflected higher compensation expense recognized during the period. 

Income Taxes --  Income
taxes were accrued at a tax rate of 39.50% and 38.91% for the first quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing
the estimated annual tax rate at the end of each respective first quarter. The increase in the fiscal 2017 tax rate relates primarily
to state apportionment changes.   

Financial Condition Analysis  

Consolidated total assets at September 30, 2016
of $884.1 million decreased 0.5% from $888.2 million at June 30, 2016 but increased 16.3% from September 30, 2015. The change since
June 30, 2016 reflects a $18.8 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio offset by declines in the net investment in leases
of $13.4 million, $4.4 million in cash and due from banks, $2.2 million in securities available-for-sale and $2.0 million of property
acquired for transactions in process. 

Lease Portfolio 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 100% and 96.4%, respectively, of the new leases
booked by the Company were held in its own portfolios. Of the new leases booked during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, 100% were
originated directly by the Company compared to 94% during the prior year first quarter. The Company s net investment in leases
at September 30, 2016 of $224.3 million compared to $237.7 million at June 30, 2016. The $13.4 million decrease in the net investment
in leases during the quarter is due to the volume of new leases being booked during the period not exceeding payments received
and leases terminating. 

The Company often makes payments to purchase
leased property prior to the commencement of the lease. The disbursements for these lease transactions in process are generally
made to facilitate the lessees  property implementation schedule. The lessee generally is obligated by the lease to make
rental payments directly to the Company during the period that the transaction is in process, and contractually obligated to reimburse
the Company for all disbursements under certain circumstances. Income is not recognized while a transaction is in process and prior
to the commencement of the lease. At September 30, 2016, the Company s investment in property acquired for transactions in
process of $28.9 million was down from $30.9 million at June 30, 2016, and from $40.8 million at September 30, 2015. 

Commercial Loan
Portfolio 

The Company s net commercial loan portfolio
increased $18.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to $422.5 million compared to $403.7 million at June 30, 2016.
The increase in the Company s commercial loan portfolio reflected new commercial loans booked of $51.5 million offset by
repayments aggregating to $32.6 million during the quarter. Additional loan commitments of $22.0 million were made during the
quarter but not funded, and at September 30, 2016 unfunded commercial loan commitments of $29.0 million were up from $15.3 million
at June 30, 2016. 

Asset Quality  

The Company monitors the performance of all
leases and loans held in its own portfolio, transactions in process, as well as lease transactions assigned to lenders, if the
Company retains a residual investment in the leased property subject to those leases. An ongoing review of all leases and loans
ten or more days delinquent is conducted. Leases and loans that are delinquent with the Company or an assignee are coded in the
Company s accounting and tracking systems in order to provide management visibility, periodic reporting, and appropriate
reserves. The accrual of interest income on leases and loans generally will be discontinued when the lease or loan becomes ninety
days or more past due on its payments with the Company, unless the Company believes the investment is otherwise recoverable. Leases
and loans may be placed on non-accrual earlier if the Company has significant doubts about the ability of the customer to meet
its obligations, as evidenced by consistent delinquency, deterioration in the customer s financial condition or other relevant
factors. 

The following table summarizes the Company s
non-performing leases and loans. 

There was no change in non-performing assets
at September 30, 2016 as compared to June 30, 2016. In addition to the non-performing leases identified above, there was $3.93
million of investment in leases at September 30, 2016 classified as substandard or with credits that currently are experiencing
financial difficulties or that management believes may experience financial difficulties in the future. This amount compared to
$3.96 million at June 30, 2016 and $271,000 at September 30, 2015. Although these credits have been identified as potential problems,
they may never become non-performing. These potential problem leases are considered in the determination of the allowance for credit
losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses provides coverage
for probable and estimatable losses in the Company s lease and loan portfolios. The allowance recorded is based on a quarterly
review of all leases and loans outstanding and transactions in process. Lease receivables, loans or residuals are charged off when
they are deemed completely uncollectible. The determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s
judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the portfolios. 

The allowance for credit losses increased $303,000
to $7.16 million (1.10% of net investment in leases and loans before allowances) at September 30, 2016 from $6.86 million (1.06%
of net investment in leases and loans before allowances) at June 30, 2016. The allowance at September 30, 2016 consisted of $230,900
allocated to specific accounts that were identified as problems and $6.93 million that was available to cover losses inherent in
the portfolio. This compared to $48,000 allocated to specific accounts at June 30, 2016 and $6.8 million available for losses inherent
in the portfolio at that time. The increase in the specific allowance at September 30, 2016 primarily relates to the downgrade
during the quarter of the credit of two specific leases. The Company considers the allowance for credit losses of $7.16 million
at September 30, 2016 adequate to cover losses specifically identified as well as inherent in the lease and loan portfolios. However,
no assurance can be given that the Company will not, in any particular period, sustain lease and loan losses that are sizeable
in relation to the amount reserved, or that subsequent evaluations of the lease and loan portfolio, in light of factors then prevailing,
including economic conditions and the on-going credit review process, will not require significant increases in the allowance for
credit losses. Among other factors, economic and political events may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss even further. 

Securities Available-for-sale 

Total securities available-for-sale was $93.7
million as of September 30, 2016, compared with $95.8 million at June 30, 2016. The amortized cost and fair value of the Company s
securities portfolio available-for-sale at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are as follows: 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the
Company s portfolio of securities available-for-sale declined $2.2 million due to pay downs of $1.8 million and a decrease
in unrecognized gains in the value of the securities of $312,000. At September 30, 2016, the weighted average maturity of the portfolio
is 5.6 years and the corresponding weighted average yield was 1.91%. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

The Company funds its operating activities through
internally generated funds, bank deposits and borrowings, and non-recourse debt. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company s
cash and cash equivalents were $100.7 million and $105.1 million, respectively. 

Deposits at CalFirst Bank totaled $629.7 million
at September 30, 2016 compared to $497.3 million at September 30, 2015 and $633.1 million at June 30, 2016. The $132.4 million
increase from September 30, 2015 was used primarily to fund the growth in the Bank s loan and securities portfolios and maintain
liquidity. The following table presents the ending balances, average balances and average rates paid on deposits for the quarters
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The following table shows the maturities of certificates of deposits at September 30,
2016: 

The Bank has borrowing agreements with the Federal
Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB ) and as such, can take advantage of FHLB programs for overnight and term advances
at published daily rates. The Bank had a short-term borrowing outstanding of $40.0 million at September 30, 2016 at an average
rate of 0.43% and an outstanding balance of $42.0 million at September 30, 2015 at an average rate of 0.35%. Under terms of the
blanket collateral agreement, advances from the FHLB are collateralized by qualifying securities and real estate loans, with $36.5
million available under the agreement as of September 30, 2016. The Bank also has the authority to borrow from the Federal Reserve
Bank ( FRB ) discount window amounts secured by certain lease receivables with unused borrowing availability at September
30, 2016 of approximately $97.3 million. 

An additional source of liquidity for financing
and managing the lease portfolio comes from selling, participating or assigning certain lease term payments to banks or other financial
institutions. If the transaction is characterized as a sale of the financial asset or meets the parameters of a participating interest,
the lease is removed from the balance sheet and a resulting gain or loss is recognized. If the Company retains a controlling interest
in the lease, the assignment is considered a secured borrowing with the associated financing characterized as non-recourse debt.
The assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate
outstanding debt. At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding non-recourse debt aggregating $3.0 million relating to discounted
lease rentals assigned to unaffiliated lenders. In the past, the Company has been able to obtain adequate non-recourse funding
commitments, and the Company believes it will be able to do so in the future. 

The following table presents capital and capital
ratio information for the Company and CalFirst Bank as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and reflects the transition to the
Basel III capital standard from previous regulatory capital adequacy guidelines under the Basel I framework. The Basel III capital
standard phases in through 2019 and revises the definition of capital, increases minimum capital ratios, introduces regulatory
capital buffers above those minimums, introduces a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and revises the rules for calculating
risk-weighted assets. Under Basel III, the Bank made a one-time election to opt out of the requirement to include components of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in common equity Tier 1 capital. The adoption of the new capital standard had an
immaterial impact on capital levels and related ratios and the Company and Bank continue to exceed regulatory capital requirements
and are considered  well-capitalized  under guidelines established by the FRB and OCC. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following table summarizes various contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2016. Commitments to purchase property for leases are binding and generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses. Commercial loan commitments are agreements to lend to a customer or purchase a participation
provided there is no violation of any condition in the contract.  These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates
or other termination clauses.  Since the Company expects some of the commitments to expire without being funded, the total
amounts do not necessarily represent the Company s future liquidity requirements. 

(1)    Disbursements to purchase property on approved lease or loan commitments are estimated
to be completed within one year, but it is likely that some portion could be deferred or never funded. 

The need for cash for operating activities has
been increasing as the Company expands its loan portfolio. The Company believes that existing cash balances, cash flow from operations,
cash flows from its financing and investing activities, and assignments (on a non-recourse basis) of lease payments will be sufficient
to meet its foreseeable financing needs. 

Inflation has not had a significant impact upon
the operations of the Company. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial
instrument arising from changes in market indices such as interest rates and equity prices. The Company s principal market
risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the exposure due to differences in the repricing characteristics of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Market risk also arises from the impact that fluctuations in interest rates may have on
security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are
accounted for at fair value. As the banking operations of the Company have grown and securities and deposits represent a greater
portion of the Company s assets and liabilities, the Company is subject to increased market risk. The Bank has an Asset/Liability
Management Committee and policies established to manage its interest rate and market risk. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had $102.1
million of cash or invested in securities of very short duration. The Company s gross investment in lease payments receivable
and loan principal of $675.2 million consists of leases with fixed rates and loans with fixed and variable rates, however, $512.4
million of such investments reprice within one year of September 30, 2016. This compares to the Bank s interest bearing deposit
and borrowing liabilities of $669.9 million, of which 83.1%, or $554.9 million, reprice within one year. CalFirst Leasing has no
interest-bearing debt, and non-recourse debt does not represent an interest rate risk to the Company because it is fully amortized
through direct payments from lessees to the purchaser of the lease receivable. Based on the foregoing, at September 30, 2016 the
Company had assets of $614.5 million subject to changes in interest rates over the next twelve months, compared to repricing liabilities
of $554.9 million. 

The consolidated gap analysis below sets forth
the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for selected time bands.
The mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time band is commonly referred to as the  gap  for that period.
A positive gap (asset sensitive) where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities generally will
result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment. A negative
gap (liability sensitive) will generally have the opposite result on the net interest margin. However, the traditional gap analysis
does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and other factors that could have
an impact on interest rate sensitivity or net interest income. Sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may
adversely impact our income to the extent that the interest rates associated with the assets and liabilities do not change at the
same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. 

In addition to the consolidated gap analysis,
the Bank measures its asset/liability position through duration measures and sensitivity analysis, and calculates the potential
effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis. The interest rate sensitivity modeling includes the creation of prospective twelve
month "baseline" and "rate shocked" net interest income simulations. After a "baseline" net interest
income is determined, using assumptions that the Bank deems reasonable, market interest rates are raised or lowered by 100 to 300
basis points instantaneously, parallel across the entire yield curve, and a "rate shocked" simulation is run. Interest
rate sensitivity is then measured as the difference between calculated "baseline" and "rate shocked" net interest
income. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's
management, including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There
were no changes made during the most recent fiscal quarter to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
