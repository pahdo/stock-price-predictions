Note 1.   Nature of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Nature of Business : 

Lightning Gaming, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated
on March 1, 2007 and on January 29, 2008, completed a merger with Lightning Poker, Inc. ( Lightning Poker ) which became
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Lightning Poker was formed to manufacture and market a fully automated,
proprietary electronic poker table (the  Poker Table ) to commercial and tribal casinos, card clubs, and other gaming
and lottery venues. Lightning Poker s Poker Table is designed to improve economics for casino operators while improving overall
player experience. 

In 2008, the Company, as the sole member, established Lightning
Slot Machines, LLC ( Lightning Slots ) through which it commenced the design, manufacture, marketing, sale and operation
of video slot machines to customers in various gaming jurisdictions. The current slot machine products are:

Our gaming products feature advanced graphics and engaging games
based on licensed, well-recognized brands, cartoon characters and proprietary non-branded themes. 

Our consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company, including  Lightning Poker and Lightning Slots.  All
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Basis of Presentation:  

The unaudited interim financial statements contained herein should
be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 25, 2016 ( Form 10-K ). The
accompanying interim financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Article 8.03 of Regulation
S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, accordingly, do not include all the disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) with respect to annual
financial statements. The interim consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Company s
accounting practices described in the Form 10-K but have not been audited. In management s opinion, the financial statements
include all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Company s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015
were derived from the Company s audited financial

Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)  

Note 1.  Nature of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Basis of Presentation    (Continued) 

statements, but do not include all disclosures required by
GAAP. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the entire year. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which assumes realization of all assets and settlement or payment of all liabilities in the ordinary
course of business. The Company has limited capital resources and the Company has experienced net operating losses and
negative cash flows from operations since inception. The generation of cash flow sufficient to meet the Company s cash
needs in the future will depend on the Company s ability to obtain the regulatory approvals required to
distribute its products and successfully market them to more casinos. Based on our cash flow projections and
anticipated revenues, we believe we have sufficient cash flows to support our operations for the next twelve months, however
if supplemental financing becomes necessary, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such financing,
on reasonable and feasible terms, or at all. If the Company needs additional funding and is unable to obtain it, its
financial condition would be adversely affected. In that event, it would have to postpone or discontinue planned operations
and projects. The Company s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon these factors, among others. The   financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

There were no material changes during the most recent fiscal
quarter in the Company s significant accounting policies described in the Form 10-K. 

The allowance for accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was $23,000 and $18,000, respectively, which includes amounts for expected credits to be issued as well as doubtful
accounts. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued converged guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts
with customers. The new guidance removes inconsistencies in current revenue recognition requirements, provides a framework for
addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition across industries, entities and jurisdictions, and provides
more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. This guidance replaces the numerous
GAAP revenue recognition requirements that are industry specific and establishes the principles to report about the nature, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with customers to users of financial statements. 

Additions to this update were issued by the FASB and IASB in March
2016, clarifying the operability and understandability on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, further clarifications
were issued on two aspects: identifying performance obligations and clarifying the licensing implementation guidance. An additional
update was issued in May 2016, which included a technical correction, clarifying the objective of assessing the collectability
criterion, the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers, specifying that the measurement date for
noncash consideration is at contract inception, and practical guidance for applying contract modifications and completed contracts
at the transition date. These updates do not change the core principles of this guidance but rather provide clarification and implementation
within the scope of this topic. 

The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company is assessing the impact it will have on our financial statements.

Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)  

Note 1.  Nature of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  (Continued) 

In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures in
the presentation of financial statements when the uncertainty exists about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
The update provides guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures. Along with requiring management s assessment of the entity s ability to continue
as a going concern, the guidance provides: 

a definition for the term  substantial doubt   

requires an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods;  

provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans;  

requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management s plans;  

requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated;
and  

requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued.  

The amendment is effective for the annual and interim
periods ending after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact this guidance may
have on our financial statements.  

In July 2015, the FASB issued an update under the inventory topic
which more clearly articulates the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory, stating that an entity should
measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments
in this update do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory
method. The amendment is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company is assessing the impact this guidance may have on our financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued an update under the income taxes
topic, simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This update aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets
and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The amendments in this update are effective
for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and the Company is assessing the impact this
guidance may have on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB finalized the accounting standard and
issued an update under the Leases topic. The update provides for major changes by lessees in that a lessee must recognize on its
statement of financial position both an asset ( right-of-use ), representing its right to use the underlying asset,
and a lease liability for all leases, other than short-term leases with terms of twelve months or less. The guidance defines a
lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment
(an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means that
the customer has both (1) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and (2) the
right to direct the use of the asset. Differentiation between finance and operating leases still remains however the most notable
difference from previous guidance is recognizing the asset and liability on the statement of financial position for operating leases. 

Lightning Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated
Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)  

Note 1.  Nature of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  (Continued) 

For finance leases, lessees are required to: 

1.    Recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position which
is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments;   
 
    2.    Recognize interest in the statement of comprehensive income on the lease liability separately
from amortization of the right-of-use asset; and                                                                     
       3.    Classify
                                         in the statement of cash flows repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability
                                         within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable
                                         lease payments within operating activities.   

For operating leases, lessees are required to: 

1.    Recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position which
is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments;   
 
    2.    Recognize a single lease cost, generally allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis;
and   
 
    3.    Classify all cash payments in the statement of cash flows as operating activities.    

Under the update, lessor accounting for leases remains largely unchanged
providing that lessor accounting is aligned with changes made to the lessee accounting guidance and key aspects under the revenue
recognition guidance. 

The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and the Company is assessing the impact this guidance will have on our
financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update on the stock compensation topic, simplifying several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, balance sheet classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and statement of cash flows classification. While the amendments in the update are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, certain aspects of the amendment, such as those
relating to the timing of excess tax benefits recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and cash
flow classification must be applied retrospectively. The Company is assessing the impact this guidance will have on our
financial statements.

Note 5.  Debt  

On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with
The Co-Investment Fund II, L.P. ( CI II ) in which the entire principal and accrued interest on promissory notes
and other related loan agreements outstanding and due to CI II, including warrants to purchase a maximum of 12,151,385 shares
of Company stock, as well as the 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Series A Nonvoting Capital Stock then outstanding, were
converted into 181,000 shares of (voting) Common Stock, par value $0.001, and 33,300,000 shares of Nonvoting Common Stock,
par value $0.001, of the Company. Upon the conversion, all notes, loans, accrued interest, and warrants due to CI II were
terminated in their entirety and all obligations were extinguished. 

Prior to conversion, substantially all of the Company s assets
had been pledged as collateral on debt and all of the notes were due on June 30, 2017 with interest at 8% on each note payable
at maturity. In May 2015, the lender agreed to suspend the accrual of interest on all of the notes outstanding, effective April
1, 2015, in anticipation of converting its debt and related obligations to equity in the transaction described above. 

See Note 7, Stockholders  Equity, and Note 9, Related Party
Transactions, for more information on debt and warrant transactions. 

Note 6. Commitments  

 In November 2009, the Company entered into a lease agreement
for its corporate offices which became effective in January 2010 for a term of sixty-seven months. In September 2014, the
lease was amended to include the following: 1) an extension of the lease term to February 28, 2021; 2) modification of the
minimum annual and monthly rents for the extended lease term; 3) a rent abatement period of six months commencing October 1,
2014; and 4) an option to extend the term for a period of five years. 

Lightning Gaming,
Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)  

Note 6. Commitments (Continued)  

Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life
of the lease and is recorded as a deferred rent obligation during the abatement period. The deferred rent is reduced by the difference
between the rent due and the straight-line expense upon commencement of the rental payments. Rental expense under this lease for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $37,386 and $34,475, respectively. Rental expense under this lease for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $117,095 and $105,156, respectively. 

Future minimum lease payments are as follows: 

The Company routinely enters into license agreements for the use
of intellectual properties and technologies. These agreements generally provide for royalty advances and license fee payments when
the agreements are signed and minimum commitments which are cancelable in certain circumstances. 

In October 2009 the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement
with Hearst Holdings, Inc. and King Features Syndicate Division to use the brands POPEYE and related family of characters in gaming
devices distributed worldwide excluding the United Kingdom and Japan. The initial term of the agreement was for one year with the
Company s right to extend the agreement for eight additional one-year terms upon payment of minimum royalties. The Company
paid the minimum royalties and extended the term of the agreement to December 2013. In April 2013, the Company was granted the
right to sublicense the POPEYE brand for distribution to bar and salon customers only in Spain for the remainder of the renewal
term. In December 2013, the Company and Hearst Holdings entered into a second renewal agreement extending the license and sublicense
renewal term from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. The extension agreement provides the Company the right to extend the agreement
for six additional renewal terms upon the payment of minimum royalties during the renewal period. 

In June 2011, the Company entered into a license agreement with
Hearst Holdings, Inc. to use the brand Blondie and related family of characters in gaming devices distributed worldwide. The initial

In November 2014, the Company entered into a license agreement with
Hearst Holdings, Inc. for the worldwide distribution of gaming devices using Flash Gordon and associated family of characters.

royalty payments will be $25,000 for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Note 7.  Stockholders  Equity  

Stock Option Plan : On March 8, 2006, Lightning Poker adopted
an equity incentive plan to enable Lightning Poker to offer key employees, consultants and directors equity interests in Lightning
Poker, thereby helping to attract, retain and motivate such persons to exercise their best efforts on behalf of Lightning Poker.
After the Merger, the options previously granted by Lightning Poker were exchanged for options to buy the Company's stock under
the Company's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Stock Plan ) having substantially the same terms. The options are granted
at the discretion of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) and, at September 30, 2016, the maximum aggregate number
of shares issuable under the Stock Plan was 2,500,000. The purchase price of each option will be determined by the Board at the
time the option is granted, but in no event will be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time of
grant. Options granted will not be exercisable after 10 years from the grant date.

Note 7. Stockholders  Equity (Continued)  

Stock Option Plan  (Continued) 

Options generally vest at 20% per year starting from the grant date
and are fully vested after five years. The options can be exercised in partial or full amounts upon a change in control and at
such other times as specified in the award agreements. 

A summary of option transactions in 2016 is as follows: 

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based upon publicly traded companies with characteristics
similar to those of the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within
the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected
to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant. There were no options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In order to provide an incentive to designated employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors and other service providers who perform services contributing to the growth of
the Company, and by aligning the interests of participants with the interests of stockholders, the Board declared it advisable
and in the Company s best interest and on May 25, 2016, approved the 2016 Stock Option Plan (the  2016 Plan ).
The 2016 Plan will permit the granting of nonqualified stock options. The shares underlying the options will be shares of our nonvoting
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and the total aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Plan is 5,700,000
shares. The purchase price of each option will be determined by the Board at the time the option is granted, but in no event will
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time of grant. Options granted will not be exercisable after
10 years from the grant date. As of September 30, 2016, there were no options granted under the 2016 Plan. 

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the statement
of operations based on awards ultimately expected to vest and may be reduced for estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense
related to stock options for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $-0- and $84, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense related to stock options was $-0- and $591, respectively.

As of September 30, 2016, all compensation costs related to nonvested

Warrants : In accordance with the loans obtained by the Company,
the lender previously held warrants to purchase 12,151,385 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $1.00 per share,
expiring at various times from April 2016 through October 2019. The purchase price was subject to adjustment from time to time
pursuant to the respective provisions of the warrant agreements. The Company calculated the value of warrants at the time of issuance
using a binomial pricing model. 

On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with
CI II in which the entire principal and accrued interest on promissory notes and other related loan agreements outstanding
and due to CI II, including the warrants described above, as well as the 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Series A Nonvoting
Capital Stock then outstanding, were converted into 181,000 shares of (voting) Common Stock, par value $0.001, and 33,300,000
shares of Nonvoting Common Stock, par value $0.001, of the Company. 

Note 8.  Income Taxes  

The Company recognizes and measures deferred income tax benefits
and liabilities based on the likelihood of their realization in future years. A valuation allowance must be established to
reduce deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred benefits will not be realized. 

As a result of the cancellation of debt and accrued interest
on debt on August 6, 2015, the Company recognized an attribute reduction of the net operating loss ( NOL )
carryforward effective January 1, 2016 of approximately $11,683,000, reducing the NOL carryforward available as of that date
from $25,104,000 to $13,126,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has available, for federal and state income tax
purposes, carryforwards of approximately $13,617,000, which expire at various times through 2036. The utilization of the
NOL carryforwards is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate sufficient taxable income during the
carryforward periods. The NOL carryforwards are also subject to certain limitations on their utilization should changes
in Company ownership occur. The Company has not recognized any NOL carryforward benefits or other net deferred tax assets in
the financial statements.

Note 9.  Related Party Transactions  

In May 2015, CI II agreed to suspend the accrual of interest
on all of the notes outstanding, effective April 1, 2015, in anticipation of entering into an agreement with the Company to
convert its debt outstanding into equity. On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with CI II in which the
entire principal and accrued interest on promissory notes and other related loan agreements outstanding and due to CI II,
including warrants to purchase a maximum of 12,151,385 shares of Company stock, as well as the 4,500,000 shares of Preferred
Series A Nonvoting Capital Stock then outstanding, were converted into 181,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share, and 33,300,000 shares of the Company s Nonvoting Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share.
Upon the conversion, all notes, loans, accrued interest, and warrants due to CI II were terminated in their entirety and all
obligations were extinguished. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest
expense on all of the loans to CI II as described above, amounted to $-0- and $312, respectively. Interest on the loans from CI
II was $-0- and $294,970 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2015, the Company made no
principal or interest payments on those loans and, on August 6, 2015, the loans were converted into equity in the transaction as
described above. 

Note 10. Concentration of Risk   Major Customers  

The Company generated approximately 16% of its revenue from its
top three customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 15% of its revenue from its top three customers for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.

Overview  

We were formed to develop and market our Poker Table, which is an
electronic poker table that provides a fully automated table gaming experience without a dealer in casinos and card rooms in regulated
jurisdictions worldwide. In 2009, we commenced the design, manufacture, marketing, sale and operation of video slot machines to
customers in various gaming jurisdictions. The current products are:

      Jungle Book

When we expanded our products to include slot machines, we embarked
on an initiative to market our slot machines to Native American jurisdictions as well as the commercial casino marketplace and
cruise lines. Our gaming products feature advanced graphics and engaging games and are based on licensed, well-recognized brands,
cartoon characters and proprietary non-branded themes. 

Our Poker Table is designed to increase revenue and security while
helping to reduce the labor costs associated with poker play. Our Poker Table achieves the goal of increasing revenue by allowing
a larger number of hands to be played per hour, increasing the  rake  or per-hand fee collected by the operator commensurately.
The elimination of a live dealer also reduces labor costs and permits more tables to be operational in jurisdictions where skilled
poker dealers are in short supply. In 2008, we developed a newer version of the Poker Table, which eliminated the need for a separate,
stand-alone cashless accounting system. The newer version allows for cash management at the Poker Table. 

Our slot machines are placed into the market using a daily lease
model or a revenue sharing model. We have 198 slot machines out on lease or revenue share in 41 different casinos and cruise ships.
As of November 14, 2016, we have sold or leased 62 newer version Poker Tables to domestic and international casinos, card rooms,
and cruise ships. 

We are registered as an approved vendor to distribute products to
gaming venues located in 14 state and Canadian province jurisdictions. 

We have generated revenues, but we have a history of losses since
our inception. We incurred a net loss of $512,043 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

(All amounts rounded to the nearest $1,000) 

Revenues   

The Company s revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $693,000 compared to $912,000 for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $219,000. 

Sales of gaming products, namely slot machines, decreased by $112,000
to $60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $172,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Lease and license fees decreased by a net of $108,000 to $633,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
$741,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The decrease in revenues
was due to the reduction in the installed slot machine base experienced during mid to late 2015. Pressure on casinos to reduce
lease expense and cut costs, consolidations and mergers in the industry creating mega-corporations that undercut pricing to gain
market share and eliminate competition,   and casinos increasing hold percentages that reduce
win percentages on which revenue-share fees are based were several of the reasons for the reduction in the revenue and the recurring
revenue base. In addition, while the for-sale market of our slot machines is successfully generating revenue and cash flow, it
is reducing the recurring revenue install base. The for-sale market reduced recurring revenue machines by 20 in 2015 and an additional
18 in the first nine months of 2016.  

Cost of Products Sold   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of products
sold decreased by $20,000 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was due to the decrease in
sales of slot machines that occurred during the quarter. 

Operating Expenses   

Operating expenses decreased by $49,000 to $127,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $176,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was
the result of the reduction in salaries and associated payroll costs from the vacancy in the operations manager position and the
reduction of costs directly associated with the slot machine activity during the quarter, i.e. freight, conversions and installation. 

Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development expenses decreased by $41,000 to $95,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $136,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development
expenses are primarily related to the development of new gaming equipment themes and technology and consist mainly of
payroll and related expenses for programmers and graphic artists and the costs to acquire new brands. This decrease is attributable
to the reduction in the number of programmers on staff and the use of consultants during the quarter. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $45,000
to $502,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $547,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This
decrease was due to the reduction in lab compliance fees as the result of a credit received in July 2016 that offset expense from
previous periods and the reduction in personnel costs associated with the vacancies in the outside salesperson in marketing and
compliance manager positions. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization decreased by $60,000 to $70,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $130,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease
was the result of the reduction of depreciation for slot machines that were fully depreciated or sold. 

Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenue   

The Company s revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,074,000 compared to $2,841,000 for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of
$767,000. As explained above, the decrease in revenues was due to the reduction in the installed slot machine base experienced
during mid to late 2015. Pressure on casinos to reduce lease expense and cut costs, consolidations and mergers in the industry
creating mega-corporations that undercut pricing to gain market share and eliminate competition,   and
casinos increasing hold percentages that reduce win percentages on which revenue-share fees are based were several of the reasons
for the reduction in the revenue and the recurring revenue base. In addition, while the for-sale market of our slot machines is
successfully generating revenue and cash flow, it is reducing the recurring revenue install base. The for-sale market reduced recurring
revenue machines by 20 in 2015 and an additional 18 in 2016.  

Cost of Products Sold   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of
products sold increased $66,000 to $100,000 from $34,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was due to the increase in the number of slot machines sold during the year as part of the for-sale market
initiative implemented to diminish the effects of the decrease in lease revenues. 

Operating Expenses   

Operating expenses decreased $193,000 to $382,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $575,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was
the result of the reduction in salaries and associated payroll costs from the vacancy in the operations manager position and the
reduction of costs directly associated with the slot machine activity during the year, i.e. freight, conversions and installation. 

Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development expenses decreased by $71,000 to $315,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $386,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development
expenses are related to the development of gaming equipment and consist mainly of payroll and related expenses for programmers
and graphic artists and the costs to acquire new brands. This decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in the number
of programmers on staff and consultants used during the year. 

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses   

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28,000
to $1,552,000   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $1,524,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to higher professional fees associated with the annual SEC audit requirements
and the common area maintenance ( CAM ) cost adjustment associated with the building lease as a result of the lessor s
2015 CAM reconciliation, offset by reductions in personnel costs in marketing and compliance. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization decreased $176,000 from $413,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $237,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was from
assets built and placed in gaming venues in prior years that are now fully depreciated or sold. 

Net Interest Expense   

Net interest expense decreased $295,000
from $295,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $-0-   for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. This decrease was as a result of the   agreement by the lenders to discontinue
the accrual of interest effective April 1, 2015, in anticipation of converting its debt into equity of the Company.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We have incurred net losses since inception. We have historically
funded our operating costs, research and development activities, working capital investments and capital expenditures associated
with our growth strategy with proceeds from the issuances of our stock and loans however commencing in 2015, we were able to fund
these costs with the proceeds from the sales of our gaming products. These transactions are described in more detail following
the discussion of cash flows below: 

Discussion of Statement of Cash Flows   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating
activities increased by $84,000 to $99,000 used in operating activities as compared to cash used of $15,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash from operating activities was due to the larger net loss experienced in 2016 and
the timing of payments to creditors, suppliers and vendors. 

Net cash used in investing activities realized a swing of
$174,000, from $127,000 provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $47,000 used in
investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in investing activities is primarily the
function of the net investment in property and equipment, principally slot machines used in our operations, and brand
licenses. This increase in cash used was the result of the $217,000 reduction in proceeds from the sale of slot machines
offset by the reduction of investments in property and equipment and brand licenses of $43,000. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities was $-0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,000 from $1,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, which represented the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock to a non-related
party. 

Operations and Liquidity Management   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a
net loss of $512,043 and used $99,212 in cash from operating activities. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance was
$210,791. The generation of cash flow sufficient to meet our cash needs in the future will depend on our ability to
obtain the regulatory approvals required to distribute our products and successfully market them to casinos and card clubs.
Our current gross cash requirements are between approximately $280,000 to $325,000 per month, principally for salaries,
professional services, licenses, marketing, office expenses and the purchase of the hardware components for our products. 

Based on our cash flow projections and anticipated revenues, we
believe we have sufficient cash flow to support our operations for the next twelve months. 

Contractual Obligations   

The table below sets forth our known contractual obligations as
of September 30, 2016: 

(1)  
      Represents operating lease agreements for office and warehouse facilities.  

(2)  
      Represents guaranteed royalty fee for brand license.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going Concern  

The Company s financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which assumes realization of all assets and settlement or payment of all liabilities in the ordinary
course of business. We have limited capital resources, and have had net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations
since the Company s inception. An increase in sales contracts and installation orders are an indication that conditions
have recently been improving and the Company expects these conditions to continue to improve, however the generation of cash flow
sufficient to meet the Company s cash needs in the future will depend on the Company s ability to obtain the regulatory
approvals required to distribute its products and successfully market them to more casinos and card clubs. Based
on our cash flow projections and anticipated revenues, we believe we have sufficient cash flows to support our operations for the
next twelve months, however if supplemental financing becomes necessary, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to
obtain such financing, on reasonable and feasible terms, or at all. 

In addition, the Company s ability to sell or lease its products
on a large scale may require additional financing for working capital. There is no assurance that the Company would be able to
obtain such financing, if at all, on reasonable terms. If the Company needs additional funding and is unable to obtain
it, the Company s financial condition would be adversely affected. In that event, the Company would have to postpone
or discontinue planned operations and projects. The Company s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon these factors,
among others. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Chief Executive Officer
( CEO ) and Controller as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of September
30, 2016, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our CEO and
Controller, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and Controller
have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level. 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during our quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
