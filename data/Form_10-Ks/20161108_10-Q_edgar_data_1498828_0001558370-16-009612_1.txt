NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), with intercompany transactions between consolidated subsidiaries eliminated. In accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) should refer to The Howard Hughes Corporation s ( HHC  or the  Company ) audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  Annual Report ) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 29, 2016 with the SEC. Certain amounts in 2015 have been reclassified to conform to 2016 presentation. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and equity for the interim periods have been included. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Management has evaluated for disclosure or recognition all material events occurring subsequent to the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements up to the date and time this Quarterly Report was filed. 

NOTE 2 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    The standard addresses how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The effective date of this standard is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU   2016-  13,    Financial Instruments Credit Losses  .  The standard modifies the impairment model for most financial assets, including trade accounts receivables and loans, and will require the use of an  expected loss  model for instruments measured at amortized cost. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The effective date of the standard is for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The standard amends several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.   The new guidance will require entities to recognize all income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability ac  counting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The effective date of this standard is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.   We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases  .  ASU 2016-02, codified in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 842, amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize mos  t leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The effective date of this standard is for

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

UNAUDITED 

fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  The new Leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after  , the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  .  The standard modifies whether: (1) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider represent a variable interest; (2) a limited partnership or similar entity has the characteristics of a variable interest entity ( VIE ) per consolidation guidance in ASC 810-10-65; and (3) a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The effective date of the standard is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 for public companies. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2016, and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued ASU 2014-09    Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The effective date of this standard is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach. Preliminary assessments of our revenue streams indicate that after adoption we will not be able to recognize revenue for condominium projects on a percentage of completion basis and generally revenue will be recognized when the units close and the title has transferred to the buyer. We are continuing to evaluate the new guidance to determine any other impacts on our consolidated financial statements, and we expect to select the implementation methodology by the filing of our annual report on 2016 Form 10-K.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,    Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  .  This ASU requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.     The effective date of this standard is for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We   do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 3 SPONSOR AND MANAGEMENT WARRANTS 

On November 9, 2010, we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to certain of our sponsors (the  Sponsor Warrants ). The exercise price for the warrants of     $50.00     per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying each warrant are subject to adjustment for future stock dividends, splits or reverse splits of our common stock or certain other events. The 1,916,667     of Sponsor Warrants outstanding are exercisable at any time and expire on November 9, 2017. 

In November 2010 and February 2011, we entered into certain agreements (the  Management Warrants ) with David R. Weinreb, our Chief Executive Officer, Grant Herlitz, our President, and Andrew C. Richardson, our former Chief Financial Officer, in each case prior to his appointment to such position to purchase shares of our common stock. The Management Warrants represent 2,862,687 underlying shares, which may be adjusted pursuant to a net settlement option, were issued pursuant to such agreements at fair value in exchange for a combined total of approximately $19.0 million in cash from such executives at the commencement of their respective employment. Mr. Weinreb and Mr. Herlitz s warrants have exercise prices of $42.23 per share and Mr. Richardson s warrants have an exercise price of $54.50 per share. Generally, the Management Warrants become exercisable in November 2016 and expire in February 2018.

UNAUDITED 

As of September 30, 2016, the estimated $124.3 million fair value for the Sponsor Warrants representing warrants to purchase 1,916,667 shares and the estimated $205.1 million fair value for the Management Warrants representing warrants to purchase 2,862,687 shares have been recorded as liabilities because the holders of these warrants could require us to settle such warrants in cash upon a change of control. The estimated fair values for the outstanding Sponsor Warrants and Management Warrants were $123.1 million and $184.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The fair values were estimated using an option pricing model and Level 3 inputs due to the unavailability of comparable market data, as further discussed in Note 7     Fair Value of Financial Instruments  . Decreases and increases in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants and the Management Warrants are recognized as either warrant liability gains or losses, respectively, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

On October 7, 2016, we entered into a management warrant agreement with our new Chief Financial Officer, David R. O Reilly, prior to his appointment to the position.  This warrant represents 50,125 underlying shares with an exercise price of $112.08 per share and was issued at fair value in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. 

NOTE 4 EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed after adjusting the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation for the effects of all potentially dilutive common shares. The dilutive effect of options and nonvested stock issued under stock based compensation plans is computed using the  treasury stock  method. The dilutive effect of the Sponsor Warrants and Management Warrants is computed using the if converted method. Gains associated with the changes in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants and Management Warrants are excluded from the numerator in computing diluted earnings per share because inclusion of such gains in the computation would be anti dilutive. 

Information related to our EPS calculations is summarized as follows:

Table of Contents  

THE HOWARD HUGHES CORPORATION 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

UNAUDITED 

The diluted EPS computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 excludes 343,500 and 404,000 stock options, respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The diluted EPS computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 excludes 153,781 shares of restricted stock, respectively,   because performance conditions have not been met. 

The diluted EPS computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 excludes 147,538 and 124,122 stock options, respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.    

NOTE 5 RECENT TRANSACTIONS 

On July 20, 2016, we acquired our joint venture partner s 18.57% interest in the 314-unit Millennium Six Pines Apartments (formerly known as Millennium Woodlands Phase II, LLC) for $4.0 million resulting in the dissolution of the joint venture. Simultaneously with the buyout, we replaced the joint venture s existing $37.7 million construction loan with a $42.5 million fixed rate loan at 3.39% maturing August 1, 2028.   Total assets of $67.9 million and liabilities of $42.7 million, including the fixed rate loan noted above, were consolidated into our financial statements at fair value as of the acquisition

date.   In accordance with GAAP, we recognized a gain of $27.1 million in conjunction with this acquisition relating to the step-up to fair value of the assets acquired.   Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our investment in   Millennium Six Pines Apartments   under the equity method. We now own 100% of this Class A multi-family property located in The Woodlands Town Center. Included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are revenues of $1.1 million and a pre-tax net loss of $0.2 million since the acquisition date.    

On June 1, 2016, the Circle T Ranch joint venture sold approximately 74 acres. Our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect $10.5 million of pre-tax income on this transaction.  

On March 16, 2016, we sold the 80 South Street Assemblage ( 80 South Street ) for net cash proceeds of $378.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $140.5 million.   80 South Street was comprised of a 42,694 square foot lot with certain air rights, providing total residential and commercial development rights of 817,784 square feet that had been acquired over the course of 2014 and 2015. 

On September 4, 2015, the Company sold The Club at Carlton Woods, its 36-hole golf and country club in The Woodlands, for net cash proceeds of $25.1 million, and purchaser s assumption of net liabilities of $4.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $29.1 million. The property was comprised of total assets of $20.9 million and total liabilities of $24.9 million. The property was developed and operated by us as an amenity for selling residential lots in a gated community in The Woodlands. Most of the lots have been sold, and the sale of this asset allowed us to redeploy capital to our development activities. 

NOTE 6 IMPAIRMENT 

We review our real estate assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. GAAP related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that if impairment indicators exist and expected undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset over our anticipated holding period are less than its carrying amount, an impairment provision should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The impairment analysis does not consider the timing of future cash flows and whether the asset is expected to earn an above or below market rate of return. 

During the third quarter 2016, we implemented a plan to sell Park West, a 249,177 square foot open-air shopping, dining and entertainment destination in Peoria, Arizona that is one of our non-core operating assets. As of September 30, 2016, the property met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Those criteria specify that the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, sale of the asset must be probable and its transfer expect to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year. A sale will allow us to redeploy the net cash proceeds from this unleveraged asset into our existing developments. Consistent with prior financial statements where we noted that a decrease by 10% of the estimated undiscounted cash to be received from this property would result in an impairment, we have recognized a $35.7 million impairment charge due to our shorter anticipated holding period. The $34.9 million net carrying value of Park West, after the impairment, represents our best estimate of its current fair market value. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately recover this amount through a sale. 

The following table summarizes our provision for impairment:

Each investment in Real Estate and Other Affiliates as discussed in Note 8     Real Estate and Other Affiliates   is evaluated periodically for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary. If the decrease in value of our investment in a Real Estate and Other Affiliate is deemed to be other-than-temporary, our investment in such Real Estate and Other Affiliate is reduced to its estimated fair value.  

No impairment charges were recorded for any of our investments in Real Estate and Other Affiliates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015.  

NOTE 7 FAIR VALUE  

ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The standard establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring assets or liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the asset or liability. Assets or liabilities with readily available active quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices, generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.  

The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy levels required under ASC 820 for each of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  

Cash equivalents consist of registered money market mutual funds which invest in United States treasury securities that are valued at the net asset value of the underlying shares in the funds as of the close of business at the end of each period. 

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. 

The valuation of warrants is based on an option pricing model, utilizing inputs which are classified as Level 3 due to the unavailability of comparable market data. The following table presents a rollforward of the valuation of our Sponsor and Management warrants:  

14 

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

UNAUDITED 

(a) 

All gains/losses during 2016 and 2015 were unrealized. Changes in the fair value of the Sponsor and Management Warrants are recognized in net income as a warrant liability gain or loss.     

The inputs to the valuation model include the fair value of stock related to the warrants, exercise price and term of the warrants, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield and, with respect to the Management Warrants, a discount for lack of marketability. Generally, an increase in expected volatility would increase the fair value of the liability, while a decrease in expected volatility would decrease the fair value of the liability, but the impact of the volatility on fair value diminishes as the market value of the stock increases above the strike price. As the period of restriction lapses, the marketability discount reduces to zero and increases the fair value of the warrants. 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our warrants as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

(a) 

Based on our implied equity volatility.

The estimated fair values of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows: 

Notes receivable are carried at net realizable value which approximates fair value. The estimated fair values are based on certain factors, such as current interest rates, terms of the note and credit worthiness of the borrower. 

The fair value of fixed-rate debt in the table above, not including our Senior Notes (please refer to Note 9     Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable  ), was estimated based on a discounted future cash payment model, which includes risk premiums and a risk free rate derived from the current London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or U.S. Treasury obligation interest rates. The discount rates reflect our judgment as to what the approximate current lending rates for loans or groups of loans with similar maturities and credit quality would be if credit markets were operating efficiently and assuming that the debt is outstanding through maturity. The fair values of our Senior Notes, included in fixed-rate  debt in the table above, are based upon the last trade price closest to the end of the period presented. 

The carrying amounts for our variable-rate debt approximate fair value given that the interest rates are variable and adjust with current market rates for instruments with similar risks and maturities. 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these instruments. 

NOTE 8 REAL ESTATE AND OTHER AFFILIATES 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the development and operations of real estate assets that are referred to as  Real Estate and Other Affiliates.  These partnerships or joint ventures are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 810   Consolidation  . 

In accordance with ASC 810, we assess our joint ventures at inception to determine if any meet the qualifications of a variable interest entity (VIE). We consider a partnership or joint venture a VIE if: (a) the total equity investment is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) characteristics of a controlling financial interest are missing (either the ability to make decisions through voting or other rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity); or (c) the voting rights of the equity holders are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity and/or their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in ASC 810, we reassess our initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a VIE.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

UNAUDITED 

We perform a qualitative assessment of each VIE to determine if we are the primary beneficiary, as required by ASC 810. A company has a controlling financial interest and must consolidate the VIE if it has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s performance, and (2)  benefits,  defined as the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The variable interest model requires a reporting entity to reevaluate whether an entity is a VIE upon the occurrence of certain significant events as listed in ASC 810-10-35-4, including any event that changes the design of the entity and calls into question the entity s sufficiency of equity at risk or characteristics of a controlling financial interest (i.e. amendments to legal governing documents, returns or additions of equity, curtailments or modifications to activities in a way that impacts the equity at risk, etc.). 

We account for investments in joint ventures which are not VIEs where we own a non-controlling interest and investments in joint ventures deemed to be VIEs for which we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary but have significant influence using the equity method. We use the cost method to account for investments where we do not have significant influence over the joint venture s operations and financial policies. Generally, the operating agreements with respect to our Real Estate Affiliates provide that assets, liabilities and funding obligations are shared in accordance with our ownership percentages. 

Our investments in Real Estate and Other Affiliates that are reported on the equity and cost methods are as follows: 

(a) 

Please refer to the discussion below for a description of the joint venture ownership structure.     

(b) 

As of July 20, 2016, we acquired our joint venture partner s interest in Millennium Six Pines Apartments (formerly known as Millennium Woodlands Phase II, LLC) and have fully consolidated the assets and liabilities of the entity. See   Note 5     Recent Transactions   for additional information regarding this transaction. The investment balance was in a $1.8 million deficit position and reported in Accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2015.      

(c) 

Equity method variable interest entity ( VIE ). The m.flats joint venture was a VIE as of December 31, 2015, but on completion of the financing in the first quarter 2016, we determined the entity was no longer a VIE.       

(d) 

The Metropolitan Downtown Columbia was placed in service in the first quarter 2015.     

We are not the primary beneficiary of any of the VIEs listed above because we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of such joint ventures and therefore we report our interests using the equity method. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of these investments is limited to the aggregate carrying value of the investment as we have not provided any guarantees or otherwise made firm commitments to fund amounts on behalf of these VIEs. The aggregate carrying value of the unconsolidated VIEs was $14.8 million and $21.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and was classified as Investment in Real Estate and Other Affiliates in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

As of September 30, 2016, approximately $123.6 million of indebtedness was secured by the properties owned by our Real Estate and Other Affiliates of which our share was approximately $54.7 million based upon our economic ownership. All of this indebtedness is without recourse to us.  

We are the primary beneficiary of one VIE which is consolidated in the financial statements. The creditors of the consolidated VIE do not have recourse to us. As of September 30, 2016, the carrying values of the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the consolidated VIE were $21.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying values of the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the consolidated VIE were $21.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The assets of the VIE are restricted for use only by the particular VIE and are not available for our general operations.  

Our recent significant investments in Real Estate Affiliates and the related accounting considerations are described below.  

The Summit  

During the first quarter 2015, we formed DLV/HHPI Summerlin, LLC ( The Summit ) a joint venture with Discovery Land Company ( Discovery ). At formation, we contributed land with a book basis of $13.4 million and transferred Special Improvement District ( SID ) bonds related to such land with a carrying value of $1.3 million to the joint venture at an agreed upon capital contribution value of $125.4 million, or $226,000 per acre. Discovery is required to fund up to a maximum of $30.0 million cash as its capital contribution, and we have no further capital obligations. The gain on the contributed land is being recognized in Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates as the joint venture sells lots.  

After receipt of our capital contribution and a 5.0% preferred return, Discovery is entitled to cash distributions by the joint venture until it has received two times its equity contribution. Any further cash distributions are shared 50/50. Discovery is the manager of the project, and development began in the second quarter 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the project has contracted for approximately $216.6 million in land sales, of which $119.8 million in lot closings were completed through the third quarter 2016, resulting in Equity in earnings to us of $22.6  million as of the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Given the nature of the venture s capital structure, our share of the venture s income producing activities is recognized based on the Hypothetical Liquidation Book Value ( HLBV ) method, which is an amount equal to the change in our underlying share of the hypothetical distribution assuming all of the venture s net assets were liquidated at book value. 

Grandview SHG, LLC 

In January 2016, we entered into a joint venture with Grandview SHG, LLC ( Grandview ), which purchased a hotel located at 33 Peck Slip in the Seaport District of New York. We advanced a bridge loan of $25.0 million at a 5.0% interest rate to the joint venture at closing to expedite the acquisition, which was repaid in full in June 2016. In the second quarter 2016, upon completion of a refinancing of the property with a $36.0 million redevelopment loan, we made an additional capital contribution of $2.3 million. Our total investment in the joint venture is $8.1 million as of September 30, 2016.

m.flats  

On October 4, 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a local developer, Kettler, Inc. ( Kettler ), to construct an apartment complex with ground floor retail in Downtown Columbia, Maryland. We contributed approximately five acres of land having a book value of $4.0 million to the joint venture and subsequently incurred an additional $3.1 million in capitalized development costs for a total book value contribution of $7.1 million. Our land was valued at $23.4 million, or $53,500 per constructed unit. In January 2016, the venture closed on an $88.0 million construction loan which is non-recourse to us and bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.40% with an initial maturity date of February 2020, with three, one-year extension options. At loan closing, Kettler contributed $16.1 million in cash, of which $7.3 million was distributed to us. This transaction was accounted for as a partial sale of the land for which we recognized a net profit of $0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We also contributed $3.9 million and $6.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, into this joint venture. 

Constellation   

On January 24, 2014, we entered into a joint venture with a national multi-family real estate developer, The Calida Group ( Calida ), to construct, own and operate a 124-unit gated luxury apartment development in Downtown Summerlin. We and our partner each own 50% of the venture, and unanimous consent of the partners is required for all major decisions. This project represents the first residential development in Summerlin s 400-acre downtown. In the first quarter 2015, we contributed a 4.5-acre parcel of land with an agreed value of $3.2 million in exchange for a 50% interest in the venture. Our partner contributed $3.2 million of cash for their 50% interest. Additionally, our partner is the development manager, funded all pre-development activities, obtained construction financing in the first quarter 2015 and provided guarantees required by the lender.   The project is financed by a $15.8 million construction loan with an outstanding balance of $11.9 million as of September 30, 2016. The loan is non-recourse to us.   In the fourth quarter 2015, we contributed an additional $1.0 million to the joint venture to fund development costs. Upon a sale of the property, we are entitled to 50% of the proceeds up to, and 100% of the proceeds in excess of, an amount determined by applying a 7.0% capitalization rate to net operating income. The venture commenced construction in February 2015 and is being completed in phases. New tenants began to take occupancy in the third quarter 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the project is 14.5% occupied and 42.7% leased.

Maturity date includes any extension periods that can be exercised at our option at the initial maturity date, subject to customary extension terms that based on current property performance projections, we expect to meet. Such terms may include but are not limited to minimum debt service coverage, minimum occupancy levels and other performance criteria. In certain cases due to property performance not meeting covenants, we may have to paydown a portion of the loan in order to obtain the extension.

Waiea and Anaha have available financing for up to $600 million in the form of a non-recourse construction loan cross-collateralized by the condominium towers bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 6.75% with an initial maturity date of November 6, 2017, and two, one-year extension options. In August 2016, the original financing agreement was modified. The previous agreement did not allow for distributions until Anaha was delivered and the loan was fully repaid. The modification allowed for an immediate advance on the loan of $50.0 million, returning a substantial portion of the project s prior cash equity contribution to us and allows for an additional distribution of up to $113 million from Waiea s bulk closing in November 2016. The balance of Waiea sales proceeds will be applied to the loan balance as well as fund any construction costs remaining for Waiea. The interest rate and maturity date remained unchanged.     

The weighted average interest rate on our mortgages, notes and loans payable, excluding interest rate hedges, was 4.68% and 4.44% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

All of the mortgage debt is secured by the individual properties listed in the table above and is non-recourse to HHC, except for:  

(ii) 

$311.8 million financing for the Downtown Summerlin development which has an initial maximum recourse of 35% of the outstanding balance, which will reduce to 15.0% upon completion of the project and achievement of a 1.15:1.0 debt service coverage ratio. The recourse further reduces to 10% upon achievement of a 1.25:1.0 debt service coverage ratio, a 90% occupancy level, and average tenant sales of at least $500.00 per net rentable square foot. As of September 30, 2016, 35% of the outstanding loan balance remains recourse to HHC;     

(iii) 

$64.4 million of construction financing for the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk with an initial maximum recourse of 50% of the outstanding balance, which will be reduced to 25.0% upon completion of the project and the achievement of an 11.0% debt yield and a minimum level of tenant sales per square foot for twelve months. As of September 30, 2016, 50% of the outstanding loan balance remains recourse to HHC;     

(iv) 

$16.2 million of Other Corporate Financing Arrangements; and      

Certain of our loans contain provisions which grant the lender a security interest in the operating cash flow of the property that represents the collateral for the loan. Certain mortgage notes may be prepaid but may be subject to a prepayment penalty equal to a yield maintenance premium, defeasance, or a percentage of the loan balance. As of September 30, 2016, land, buildings and equipment and developments with a net book value basis of $3.0 billion have been pledged as collateral for our mortgages, notes and loans payable.   

As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants related to our debt agreements. 

Master Planned Communities 

On November 9, 2015, we refinanced $15.2 million of existing debt in connection with closing on a modification which increased the Bridgeland Credit Facility to $65.0 million. The facility bears interest at three-month LIBOR plus 3.15%, with a 4.60% floor, and has an initial maturity date of November 2020 with two, one-year extension options. The proceeds are providing working capital at Bridgeland for development efforts necessary to meet the demand of homebuilders for finished lots in the community. 

The Woodlands Master Credit Facility was amended and restated on July 31, 2015 to a $200.0 million maximum facility amount consisting of a $100.0 million term loan and a $100.0 million revolver (together, the  TWL Facility ). The TWL Facility bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% and had an August 2016 initial maturity date with two, one year extension options. In July 2016, we exercised our first one-year extension option, which reduced the total commitment to

$175.0 million. Semi-annual principal payments of $25.0 million begin on December 31, 2016 and continue through the second, optional one-year extension period. The TWL Facility and The Woodlands Resort   Conference Center loans are recourse to the entities that directly own The Woodlands operations. The TWL Facility also contains certain covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of specified financial ratios, limit the incurrence of additional recourse indebtedness at The Woodlands, and limit distributions from The Woodlands to us based on a loan to value test. The amendment also modified certain covenants to allow for more construction loan guarantees by the entities that directly own The Woodlands than would otherwise have been permitted by the prior facility.   

The Summerlin MPC uses SID bonds to finance certain common infrastructure improvements. These bonds are issued by the municipalities and are secured by the assessments on the land. The majority of proceeds from each bond issued is held in a construction escrow and disbursed to us as infrastructure projects are completed, inspected by the municipalities and approved for reimbursement. Accordingly, the SID bonds have been classified as debt, and the Summerlin MPC pays the debt service on the bonds semi annually. As Summerlin sells land, the buyers assume a proportionate share of the bond obligation at closing, and the residential sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of the principal amounts that we previously paid with respect to such proportionate share of the bond.   In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no new SID bonds were issued and $5.5 million in obligations were assumed by buyers.  

Operating Assets 

On September 12, 2016, we amended and restated the $238.7 million first mortgage secured by Ward Village.   The   non-recourse term   loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.50% with an initial maturity date of September 12, 2021, with two, one-year extension options. $119.4 million of the outstanding principal balance is swapped to a 3.64% fixed-rate through maturity. There was no undrawn availability on this loan as of September 30, 2016.  

Strategic Developments  

On October 7, 2016 we closed on a $33.2 million non-recourse construction loan for Two Merriweather, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.5% with an initial maturity date of October 7, 2020 and a one-year extension option. 

On February 25, 2016, we closed on a $49.9 million non-recourse construction loan for One Merriweather. The loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.15% with an initial maturity date of February 25, 2020, with a one-year extension option.  

On January 27, 2016, we closed on a $6.4 million non-recourse construction loan for the HHC 2978 Self-Storage Facility, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.60% with an initial maturity date of January 2020, with two, one-year extension options. 

NOTE 10 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable interest rate debt, and we manage this risk by utilizing interest rate derivatives. Our objective in using interest rate derivatives is to add stability to interest costs by reducing our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we use interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps, and caps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As of September 30, 2016, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $326.0 million and a $100.0 million interest rate cap, all of which were designated as effective cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. We also have $250.0 million in gross notional amounts of forward-starting interest rate swaps that become effective December 31, 2017 to hedge a portion of anticipated future fixed-rate debt issuance.  

Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company s fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The forward-starting interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the anticipated interest

rate of our long-term financing needs at our Downtown Summerlin property. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front premium. 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the ineffective portion recorded in earnings was insignificant. 

If the derivative contracts are terminated prior to their maturity, the amounts previously recorded in AOCI are recognized into earnings over the period that the hedged transaction impacts earnings. If the hedging relationship is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur according to the original strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in AOCI are recognized in earnings immediately. 

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt. Over the next 12 months, we estimate that an additional $1.9 million will be reclassified to interest expense. 

The table below presents the fair value of our derivative financial instruments, which are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets:

NOTE 11   INCOME TAXES 

Unrecognized tax benefits pursuant to uncertain tax positions were $35.4 million and $36.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, none of which would impact our effective tax rate.  

We have significant permanent differences, primarily from warrant liability gains and losses and changes in valuation allowances that cause our effective tax rate to deviate from statutory rates. The effective tax rates, based upon actual operating results, were 56.0% and 39.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 10.5% and 19.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in the tax rates were primarily attributable to changes in the warrant liability, valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets, as well as other items which are permanent differences for tax purposes.  

The increase in deferred tax liabilities between December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 is due primarily to the utilization of federal tax assets used to offset both the tax gain on the sale of the 80 South Street Assemblage and other sources of operating income.

NOTE 13 OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets 

The following table summarizes the significant components of Prepaid expenses and other assets. 

(a) 

Approximately $32.3 million are expected to be collected in 2016 and $137.3 million are expected to be collected in 2017, based upon anticipated closings of the respective condominium projects.     

The $379.1 million net increase primarily relates to the following:  

A $422.5 million increase in condominium deposits due to cash buyers remitting the remaining balance of the sales prices in full prior to closing as required in the sales contracts; $3.3 million increase in prepaid expenses; and $0.1 million in other increases.

These increases were partially offset by the following decreases: a $21.4 million decrease in condominium receivables due primarily to remittance of the remaining balance of the sales price in full by cash buyers prior to closing; a net $7.2 million decrease in security and escrow deposits mostly attributable to our January 2016 investment in the Grandview SHG, LLC joint venture; a $6.3 million decrease in SID receivable due to reimbursement for construction expenditures; a decrease of $5.9 million relating primarily to the amortization of in-place leases; a net decrease in other prepaids of $1.9 million; and a $4.1 million decrease in various other accounts. 

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 

The following table summarizes the significant components of Accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

(a) 

Straight-line ground rent was previously reported in Other.      

Total accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by $87.9 million primarily due to the following:  

A $56.1 million increase in condominium deposits liability due to starting sales at Ke Kilohana and continued sales and additional deposit requirements at Ae  '  o; an increase of $8.3 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses; an increase of $23.6 million in interest rate swaps liability primarily due to a decrease in fair value of the forward-starting swaps; an increase of $12.5 million in accrued interest primarily due to six months of accrued interest at September 30, 2016 as compared to three months of accrued interest at December 2015 for our Senior Notes; $4.7 million increase in accrued real estate taxes; and $4.9 million in other immaterial accounts.  

These increases are partially offset by the following: decrease of $13.0 million in deferred income due to the recognition of income on projects as the performance obligations are fulfilled; decrease of $7.0 million in accrued payroll and other employee liabilities primarily due to the payment of bonuses in the first quarter 2016; and $2.2 million in other immaterial decreases.

NOTE 15 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

In the normal course of business, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings relating to the ownership and operations of our properties. In management s opinion, the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

We had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $116.0 million and $86.1 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These letters of credit and bonds were issued primarily in connection with insurance requirements, special real estate assessments and construction obligations.

On June 27, 2013, the City of New York executed the amended and restated ground lease for South Street Seaport. The restated lease terms provide for annual fixed base rent of $1.2 million starting July 1, 2013 with an expiration of December 30, 2072, including our options to extend. The rent escalates at 3.0% compounded annually. On July 1, 2048 the base rent will be adjusted to the higher of the fair market value or the then base rent. In addition to the annual base rent, we are required to make annual payments of $210,000 for the esplanade as additional rent through the term of the lease. The additional rent escalates annually at the Consumer Price Index. Simultaneously with the execution of the lease, we executed a completion guaranty for the redevelopment of Pier 17 by 2017.  

In the fourth quarter 2012, the historic area of South Street Seaport suffered damage due to flooding as a result of Superstorm Sandy. Reconstruction efforts are ongoing and the property has only partially operated over the last three years. We have received $54.1 million in insurance proceeds, and we recognized Other income of $6.2 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, for the receipt of insurance proceeds related to our claim. This matter is currently being litigated, and there can be no assurance that we will collect additional insurance proceeds. 

NOTE 16 SEGMENTS 

We have three business segments which offer different products and services. Our three segments are managed separately because each requires different operating strategies and management expertise and are reflective of management s operating philosophies and methods. In addition, our segments or assets within such segments could change in the future as development of certain properties commences or other operational or management changes occur. All operations are within the United States, and we do not distinguish or group our combined operations on a geographic basis. Our reportable segments are as follows: 

Master Planned Communities ( MPCs )   includes the development and sale of land, in large scale, long term community development projects in and around Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; and Columbia, Maryland.     

Operating Assets   includes retail, office, hospitality and multi-family properties along with other real estate investments. These assets are currently generating revenues and are comprised of commercial real estate properties developed or acquired by us, and properties where we believe there is an opportunity to redevelop, reposition or sell to improve segment performance or to recycle capital.      

Strategic Developments   includes our residential condominium and commercial property projects currently under development and all other properties held for development which have no substantial operations.

Our segments are managed separately, therefore, we use different operating measures to assess operating results and allocate resources among the segments. The one common operating measure used to assess operating results for the business segments is Real Estate Property Earnings Before Taxes ( REP EBT ), which represents the operating revenues of the properties less property operating expenses and adjustments for interest, as further described below. We believe that REP EBT provides useful information about the operating performance of all of our properties.    

REP EBT, as it relates to our business, is defined as net income (loss) excluding general and administrative expenses, corporate other income, corporate interest income, corporate interest and depreciation expense, provision for income taxes, warrant liability gain (loss), gains or losses on sales of operating properties and gain on acquisition of joint venture partner s interest. We present REP EBT because we use this measure, among others, internally to assess the core operating performance of our assets. We also present this measure because we believe certain investors use it as a measure of a company s historical operating performance and its ability to service and obtain financing. We believe that the inclusion of certain adjustments to net income (loss) to calculate REP EBT is appropriate to provide additional information to investors.    

Segment operating results are as follows:

The assets by segment and the reconciliation of total segment assets to the total assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are summarized as follows: 

The $176.1 million increase in the Strategic Developments segment asset balance as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the receipt of cash for the remaining sales price from cash buyers at Waiea prior to closing.  

The increase in the Operating Assets segment asset balance as of September 30, 2016 of $215.0 million compared to December 31, 2015   is primarily due to the buyout of our partner s interest in Millennium Six Pines Apartments   (formerly known as Millennium Woodlands Phase II, LLC)  , placing in service The Westin at The Woodlands, Three Hughes Landing, Lakeland Village Center and additional development expenditures at South Street Seaport.     

The $353.5 million increase in the Corporate and other asset balance as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the proceeds from the 80 South Street sale in March 2016. The development costs were reported

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S   DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in this Quarterly Report and in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. All references to numbered Notes are to specific notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report.  

Forward-looking information  

We may make forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report and in other reports that we file with the SEC. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, creditors, the media and others. 

Forward-looking statements include: 

projections and expectations regarding our revenues, operating income, net income, earnings per share, REP EBT, Net Operating Income ( NOI ), capital expenditures, income tax, other contingent liabilities, dividends, leverage, capital structure or other financial items;      

forecasts of our future economic performance; and     

descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing.     

In this Quarterly Report, we make forward-looking statements discussing our expectations about: 

capital required for our operations and development opportunities for the properties in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments;     

expected performance of our Master Planned Communities segment and other current income producing properties; and     

future liquidity, development opportunities, development spending and management plans.     

Forward-looking statements give our current expectations relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historical facts. These statements may include words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   likely,   may,   plan,   project,   realize,   should,   transform,   would,  and other statements of similar expression. Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon. They give our expectations about the future and are not guarantees. 

There are several factors, many beyond our control, which could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. These risk factors are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Annual Report ) and are incorporated herein by reference. Any factor could, by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. There may be other factors that we have not described in this Quarterly Report or in our Annual Report that could cause results to differ from our expectations. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to modify or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report. 

Real Estate Property Earnings Before Taxes 

We use a number of operating measures for assessing operating performance of properties within our segments, some of which may not be common among all three of our segments. We believe that investors may find some operating measures more useful than others when separately evaluating each segment. One common operating measure used to assess operating results for our business segments is Real Estate Property Earnings Before Taxes ( REP EBT ). We believe REP EBT provides useful information about the operating performance of our properties because it excludes certain non-  

33 

Table of Contents  

recurring and non-cash items, which we believe are not indicative of our core business. REP EBT may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

REP EBT, as it relates to our business, is defined as net income (loss) excluding general and administrative expenses, corporate other income, corporate interest income, corporate interest and depreciation expense, provision for income taxes, warrant liability gain (loss), gain or loss on sale of operating properties and gain on acquisition of joint venture partner s interest. We also provide a measure of Adjusted Operating Assets REP EBT, which excludes depreciation and amortization, development-related demolition and marketing costs and provision for impairment. We present REP EBT because we use these measures, among others, internally to assess the core operating performance of our assets. We also present these measures because we believe certain investors use them as a measure of a company s historical operating performance and its ability to service and incur debt. We believe that the inclusion of certain adjustments to net income (loss) to calculate REP EBT and the exclusion of other non-operating items from REP EBT to calculate Adjusted Operating Assets REP EBT is appropriate to provide additional information to investors. A reconciliation of REP EBT to consolidated net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP has been presented in Note 16     Segments  . A reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Assets EBT to Operating Assets EBT is included in the Operating Assets discussion.  

REP EBT and Adjusted Operating Assets REP EBT should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders or GAAP net income (loss), as they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are that they do not include the following: 

cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;      

corporate general and administrative expenses;     

interest expense on our corporate debt;     

income taxes that we may be required to pay;      

any cash requirements for replacement of fully depreciated or amortized assets; and     

limitations on, or costs related to, transferring earnings from our Real Estate and Other Affiliates to us.     

Operating Assets Net Operating Income 

We believe that net operating income ( NOI ) is a useful supplemental measure of the performance of our Operating Assets because it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in rental and occupancy rates and operating costs. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recoveries and other revenue) less operating expenses (real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other property expenses). NOI excludes straight-line rents and amortization of tenant incentives, net interest expense, ground rent amortization, demolition costs, amortization, depreciation, development-related marketing costs and Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance on a property-by-property basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors, which vary by property, such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our operating results, gross margins and investment returns. 

Although we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors about the performance of our Operating Assets, due to the exclusions noted above, NOI should only be used as an additional measure of the financial performance of such assets and not as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). For reference, and as an aid in understanding our computation of NOI, a reconciliation of Operating Assets NOI to Operating Assets REP EBT has been presented in the Operating Assets segment discussion below.

Results of Operations  

Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of individual lots to homebuilders at our master planned communities, from tenants at our operating assets in the form of fixed minimum rents, overage rent and recoveries of operating expenses and from the sale of condominium units.  

The following table reflects our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

(a) 

Total segment REP EBT includes depreciation and amortization expense for assets placed in service. Non-cash total segment depreciation and amortization, primarily relating to Operating Assets recently placed in service, is currently offsetting the net operating income generated from these properties because they typically will not stabilize for 12   36 months after they are placed in service, but the full amount of their annual depreciation and amortization begins when they are placed in service. The following table shows the amounts included in segment REP EBT  related to non-cash depreciation and amortization:     

Total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher revenues in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments. Generally, MPC revenues fluctuate during the year; therefore, a better measurement of performance is the full year impact instead of quarterly results. See  Segment Operations  below for more discussion of the individual segments.  

General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the same periods in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the increase is primarily due to $1.9 million of higher compensation costs related to headcount and $0.6 million of increased information technology costs due to system implementations and upgrades compared to the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increase is primarily due to $2.4 million of higher compensation costs related to headcount and $1.8 million of increased information technology costs due to system implementations and upgrades compared to the same period in the prior year.

Table of Contents  

We realized a gain of $27.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the acquisition of our Millennium Six Pines Apartments (formerly known as Millennium Woodlands Phase II, LLC) joint venture partner s interest. In accordance with ASC 805, we remeasured to fair value our equity interest held in the joint venture as of the July 20, 2016 acquisition date. We also realized a gain of $29.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 relating to the September 2015 sale of The Club at Carlton Woods for net cash proceeds of $25.1 million and purchaser s assumption of net liabilities of $4.0 million. 

Provision for income taxes decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to a tax benefit recognized for the   provision for impairment for Park West.   The increase in the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to increases in pre-tax earnings, as noted on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, adjusted to exclude the non-taxable warrant gain (loss) which has no impact on our tax provision. 

We have significant permanent differences, primarily due to warrant liability gains and losses and changes in valuation allowances that cause our effective tax rate to deviate greatly from statutory rates. The effective tax rates, based upon actual operating results were 56.0% and 39.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 10.5% and 19.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The changes in the tax rate were primarily attributable to changes in the warrant liability, valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset, as well as other items which are permanent differences for tax purposes. If changes in the warrant liability, valuation allowance, unrecognized tax benefits, and other material discrete adjustments to deferred tax liabilities were excluded from the effective tax rate computation, the adjusted effective tax rates would have been 42.6% and 37.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 35.0% and 35.2% for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The decrease in Net income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a warrant liability loss in 2016 as compared to a gain in 2015, and a provision for impairment in our Operating Assets segment REP EBT offset by increased REP EBT in our MPC and Strategic Developments segments. The increase in Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to significant growth in Strategic Developments REP EBT from higher condominium rights and unit revenue recognition and a gain of $140.5 million on the sale of the 80 South Street Assemblage. The increase is also due to higher MPC segment REP EBT. These increases are partially offset by a provision for impairment in our Operating Assets segment REP EBT, a warrant liability loss and an increased provision for income taxes.

MPC revenues vary between periods based on economic conditions and several factors such as, but not limited to, location, availability of land for sale, development density and residential or commercial use. Gross margin for each MPC may vary from period to period based on the locations of the land sold and the related costs associated with developing the land sold. Reported results may differ significantly from actual cash flows generated principally because cost of sales for GAAP purposes is derived from margins calculated using carrying values, projected future improvements and other capitalized project costs in relation to projected future land sale revenues. Carrying values, generally, represent acquisition and development costs reduced by any previous impairment charges. Development expenditures are capitalized and generally not reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the current period  .   

Builder price participation revenue is based on an agreed-upon percentage of the estimated sales price of the home relative to the base lot price. 

37 

Table of Contents  

In the third quarter 2016, the gross margin for The Woodlands decreased by 14.4% due to downward adjustments in the lot prices for some product lines and a decrease in commercial acreage sold. For selected lot sizes, lot prices were reduced to meet current market conditions and to help stimulate lot sales. Most of the lot sales in the third quarter were in the product lines where the lot sale prices were adjusted. Subsequent home sales have been responding positively and we believe that further reductions for these lot sizes will not be required. Also, in the third quarter 2015 there was a large commercial land sale that contributed to the higher gross margin. 

Cost of sales   land includes both actual and estimated future costs allocated based upon relative sales value to the lots or land parcels in each of the villages and neighborhoods in our MPCs.  

Interest expense, net reflects the amount of interest that is capitalized at the project level.  

Although our business does not involve the sale or resale of homes, we believe that net new home sales are an important indicator of future demand for our superpad sites and lots; therefore, we use this statistic where relevant in the discussion of our MPC operating results. Net new home sales reflect home sales made by homebuilders, less cancellations. Cancelations occur when a home buyer signs a contract to purchase a home, but later fails to qualify for a home mortgage or is unable to provide an adequate down payment to complete the home sale.

Houston MPCs 

Bridgeland 

Residential land sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were substantially higher compared to the same periods in 2015 due to increased demand from homebuilders, offset by a $20.5 million decrease in commercial land sales from 2015. While the greater Houston market remains impacted by the ongoing economic stagnancy caused by low oil prices, the Bridgeland submarket has shown improvement in the mid-range of the residential market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Bridgeland sold 12.2 and 36.2 residential acres, respectively, compared to 5.8 and 21.3 acres for the same periods in 2015. The average price per residential acre for single-family   detached product decreased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, by 2.0% and 4.3%, respectively. The decrease is attributable to a combination of lot price adjustments to meet current market conditions and the mix of lots sold in the respective periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a larger percentage of smaller, lower priced lots sold than in the same periods in 2015.  

There were 74 and 243 new home sales at Bridgeland for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing an increase of 105.6% and 67.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the median price of new homes sold in Bridgeland was $308,000, a 23.6% decrease compared to $403,000 for the same period in 2015. The median price of new homes sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 20.4% to $324,000 compared to $407,000 for the same period in 2015. These decreases in median home pricing are due to the mix of homes sold and reflect increased sales of more affordable homes. Land and home absorption rates at Bridgeland in 2016 have benefited from the wide variety of products being offered at highly competitive prices. In addition, the Grand Parkway toll road, which opened in February 2016, provides greater connectivity between Bridgeland and major employment centers in Houston. 

The Woodlands  

The $6.7 million decrease in total land sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a 3.3-acre medical office building land sale in the third quarter 2015 for $6.8 million. The $8.8 million decrease in total land sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due to reduced lot sales of $10.3 million due to 72 fewer lot closings, offset by a $1.5 million increase in commercial land sales. 

There were 105 lot closings in The Woodlands for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which were 72 fewer than the same period in 2015. The reduced lot sales pace is due primarily to the downturn in the Houston economy resulting from lower oil prices and the disproportionate impact this has had on the upper end of the housing market. Also contributing to the reduced lot sales pace is the build-up of homebuilder vacant lot inventory levels to 505 lots as of September 30, 2016. Based on current home sales velocity, this level of inventory could equate to more than a two-year supply of some product types. The 179 home sales, which exceeded the 105 lot closings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, helped reduce the homebuilder vacant lot inventory from 575 at December 31, 2015 to 505 as of September 30, 2016. 

There were 62 and 179 new home sales in The Woodlands for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, representing a 29.2% increase and 16.7% decrease, respectively, compared to the 48 and 215 new home sales for the same periods in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the median price of new homes sold in The Woodlands decreased 3.3% to $578,000 compared to $598,000 for the same period in 2015. The median price of new homes sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 1.6% to $559,000 compared to $568,000 for the same period in 2015. The lower home prices indicate that homebuilders are reducing home prices to meet homebuilder demand at a lower price point. 

The Woodlands Hills 

On June 30, 2016, we received approval of our development plan for The Woodlands Hills from the City of Conroe. As a result of this approval, we can now begin submitting plats to the City of Conroe for their review and approval of the first sections scheduled for development. We currently expect to start water, sewer and drainage construction in the fourth quarter 2016 and sales to begin in the fourth quarter 2017. We believe that The Woodlands Hills is well-positioned to

capture the home buying demand for moderately priced homes. It has a projected lower price point for all product types compared to The Woodlands, with pricing comparable to Bridgeland. Furthermore, it benefits from The Woodlands  brand reputation and has a favorable location to major employment centers, including the medical and office centers in The Woodlands and the ExxonMobil campus located just south of The Woodlands  .  

Maryland 

Our Columbia, Gateway, Emerson and Fairwood communities contain approximately 108 commercial acres remaining to be sold, there were no commercial land sales for the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. All of the residential inventory was sold out in prior years. 

In December 2015, approximately 35 acres of the Columbia commercial acreage was transferred to our Strategic Developments segment as we began development of office space in the Downtown Columbia Town Center Redevelopment District ( DCRD ). The entitlements, which do not expire under Maryland law, are enabling us to redevelop Downtown Columbia, a portion of DCRD and further support the approximate 112,000 residents  . 

Summerlin 

Land sales revenue of $26.3 million and $106.3 million recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes $7.6 million and $13.9 million, respectively, in revenue from land sales closed in prior periods which were previously deferred and met criteria for recognition in the current periods. 

Summerlin s land sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were lower compared to the same period in 2015 due to the sale of one superpad in the third quarter 2016 compared to two superpads in the third quarter 2015. The average price per superpad acre sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $485,000 compared to $492,000 for the same period in 2015, a reduction of 1.4%. Summerlin s land sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were slightly lower compared to the same period in 2015. The average price per superpad acre for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $408,000 is not comparable to the average price per acre of $544,000 for the same period in 2015 due to a $40 million bulk sale to a homebuilder for a large parcel in the first quarter 2016. This sale was unique as the homebuilder will be responsible for installing power and drainage facilities to the village, and unlike a typical sale, Summerlin is not obligated to incur any development costs within the boundaries of the parcel. Gross margin increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 due to this sale of undeveloped land for which we incurred much lower development costs. In addition, as part of the transaction we negotiated a favorable adjustment to the builder price participation on the land we sold to the same homebuilder in 2006. 

The Summerlin market and job growth remain strong. Summerlin had 195 and 545 new home sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, representing a 42.3% and 17.5% increase compared to 137 and 464 new home sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the median price of new homes sold in Summerlin increased 2.2% to $521,000 compared to $510,000 for the same period in 2015. The median price of new homes sold in Summerlin increased 2.1% to $538,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $527,000 for the same period in 2015.   

Land development began at The Summit, our joint venture with Discovery Land, in the second quarter 2015 and continues to progress on schedule based upon the initial plan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 38 custom residential lots had closed resulting in the recognition of $22.6 million in Equity in earnings in Real Estate and Other Affiliates. Discovery is the manager of the project, and development began in the second quarter 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the project has contracted for approximately $216.6 million in land sales, of which $119.8 million in lot closings were completed through the third quarter 2016. This revenue is being recognized as the development progresses under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Please refer to Note 8     Real Estate and Other Affiliates   for a description of the joint venture and our share of equity earnings in the period.  

MPC Net Contribution 

In addition to REP EBT for the MPCs, we believe that certain investors measure the value of the assets in this segment based on their contribution to liquidity and capital available for investment. MPC Net Contribution is defined as MPC REP EBT, plus MPC cost of sales, depreciation and amortization, and net collections from   Special Improvement District

Table of Contents  

( SID ) bonds and Municipal Utility District ( MUD ) receivables,   reduced by MPC development and land acquisition expenditures. Although MPC Net Contribution can be computed from GAAP elements of income and cash flows, it is not a GAAP-based operational metric and should not be used to measure operating performance of the MPC assets as a substitute for GAAP measures of such performance. A reconciliation of REP EBT to consolidated net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP is presented in Note 16 -   Segments  . 

The following table sets forth the MPC Net Contribution for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

SID bond collections are shown net of SID bond assumptions by buyers in the respective periods.      

While the land sales closed for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased as compared to the same period in 2015, $10.2 million of revenue previously deferred due to future performance obligations met criteria for recognition in the current period. The Summit at our Summerlin MPC contributed earnings of $13.7 million and $22.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Accordingly, MPC Net Contribution increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in MPC REP EBT at Summerlin and the reduction in MPC development expenditures in 2016.  

The following table sets forth MPC land inventory activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Operating Assets  

Operating assets typically generate rental revenues sufficient to cover their operating costs except when a substantial portion, or all, of the property is being redeveloped, vacated for development or is in its initial lease-up phase. Variances between years in NOI typically result from changes in rental rates, occupancy, tenant mix and operating expenses. We view NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our Operating Assets segment. See Operating Assets NOI and REP EBT table below. 

Total revenues and expenses for the Operating Assets segment are summarized as follows:  

(*)  For a reconciliation of Operating Assets REP EBT to consolidated income (loss) before taxes, refer to Note 16 -   Segments  .   

Minimum rents and tenant recoveries increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015   due to increases of $8.1 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for our retail, office and multi-family properties. The increase for our retail properties was primarily due to the elimination of co-tenancy allowances for the majority of tenants at Downtown Summerlin. The increase in our office properties was primarily due to the openings of 1725-1735 Hughes Landing Boulevard.   The increase in our multi-family properties was primarily due to the opening of One Lakes Edge in 2015 and the purchase of our partner s interest in Millennium Six Pines Apartments (formerly known as Millennium Woodlands Phase II, LLC). 

Hospitality revenues increased for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due primarily to the opening of the Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing in December 2015 and   The Westin at The Woodlands   in March 2016.  

Other rental and property revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to a decrease in termination fee income and the sale of the Club at Carlton Woods in September 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other rental and property revenue decreased primarily due to the sale of the Club at Carlton Woods in September 2015.  

Other property operating costs and rental property maintenance costs decreased for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period 2015   due to the sale of the Club at Carlton Woods, partially offset by an increase for our office properties primarily due to the openings of 1725-1735 Hughes Landing Boulevard.

Table of Contents  

Rental property real estate taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period 2015   increased primarily due to the openings of 1725-1735 Hughes Landing Boulevard and ONE Summerlin in 2015 ( 2015 Office Openings ), Downtown Summerlin and the opening of One Lakes Edge apartments offset by the sale of Carlton Woods. 

Hospitality costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the opening of the Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing in December 2015 and   The Westin at The Woodlands   in March 2016 offset by a decrease in hospitality costs at The Woodlands Resort   Conference Center due to a decline in occupancy and conference center   services. 

Provision for doubtful accounts increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to collectability issues related to a tenant s termination fees. Additionally, the provision for doubtful accounts increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to a write-off of straight-line rent at Ward Village as a result of an agreement reached in the second quarter to assume a bankrupt tenant s lease. Recoveries of the pre-petition receivables are recognized in accordance with the agreement.  

The provision for impairment resulted from a decrease in our expected holding period for Park West which resulted in an impairment. The property also has an approximate $81.4 million tax basis, which upon a sale of the property for our estimated carrying value would represent a $46.5 million tax loss that could be used to offset future taxable income.  

Depreciation and amortization   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 decreased due to the transfer of an asset at Ward Village to development.    

Interest expense increased primarily due to higher loan balances on properties acquired or placed in service. The increase for retail during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to Downtown Summerlin and Hughes Landing Retail. The increase for office was due primarily to 10-60 Columbia Corporate Center, Two Hughes Landing and 1725-1735 Hughes Landing. Multi-family interest expense increased due to placing One Lakes Edge in service in 2015. Hospitality interest expense increased due to placing in service The Westin at The Woodlands and The Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing. 

Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period for 2015 due primarily to a $2.6 million distribution from our Summerlin Hospital investment as compared to $1.7 million in 2015. 

Demolition costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 due primarily to the completion of the interior demolition work for the Fulton Market Building at South Street Seaport.   

Development-related marketing costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 due to a decrease in marketing costs at Seaport. We incurred higher costs in 2015 due to the opening and operations of our studio store for pre-leasing activities. The costs in 2016 relate to ongoing marketing initiatives as we continue leasing efforts in advance of the completion of our Pier 17 redevelopment. 

When a development property is placed in service, depreciation is calculated for the property ratably over the estimated useful lives of each of its components; however, most of our recently developed properties do not reach stabilization for 12 to 36 months after being placed in service due to the timing of tenants taking occupancy and subsequent leasing of remaining unoccupied space during that period. As a result, operating income, earnings before taxes (EBT) and net income will not reflect the ongoing earnings potential of newly placed in service operating assets during this transition period to stabilization. Accordingly, we calculate Adjusted Operating Assets REP EBT, which excludes depreciation and amortization and development-related demolition and marketing costs and provision for impairment, as they do not represent operating costs for stabilized real estate properties. Adjusted Operating Assets REP EBT decreased 3.2% for the three months and increased 20.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in prior year, due to the 2015 Office Openings and the opening of The Westin at The Woodlands and The Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing.

Retail Properties 

Some of the leases related to our retail properties are triple net leases, which generally require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of property operating costs, such as real estate taxes, utilities and insurance, and the direct costs of their leased space. We also have leases which require tenants to pay a fixed-rate per square foot reimbursement to us for common area costs which is increased annually according to the terms of the lease.

Lakeland Village Center    

In the second quarter 2015, we     began construction of Lakeland Village Center, a CVS-anchored neighborhood retail center. CVS opened in March 2016, and this portion of the project is substantially complete and open to the public. The remaining total development costs are expected to be approximately   $16 million, and we have incurred $12.1 million as of September 30, 2016. We expect to reach stabilized annual NOI of approximately $1.7 million in 2018. As of October 20, 2016, the project is 40.6% leased  .    The project is financed by a $14.0 million non-recourse construction loan bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.35% with an initial maturity date of May 15, 2018, with two, one-year extension options.

Hughes Landing 

1725-1735 Hughes Landing Boulevard    

This project was substantially completed and moved to our Operating Assets segment in the fourth quarter 2015 at which time ExxonMobil, the primary tenant, began occupying its space. ExxonMobil has leased the 318,170 square foot 1735 Hughes Landing Boulevard building for 12 years, and 159,952 square feet of the total 331,067 square foot 1725 Hughes Landing Boulevard building for eight years. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $213 million, which includes $61.1 million of tenant improvements, which have been fully reimbursed by ExxonMobil. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $181.6 million of development costs, and the remainder will be incurred as the space is leased. We have signed additional leases for 1725 Hughes Landing Boulevard for approximately 50,000 square feet. As of October 20, 2016, the building is 82.6% leased. Assuming leasing of the remaining space and based on ExxonMobil s current 478,000 square foot commitment, we expect to reach annual NOI of approximately $14.0 million when stabilized;   however, the actual amount of NOI and year of stabilization will depend greatly on the Houston economy  . The project is financed by a $143.0 million non-recourse construction loan bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.65% with an initial maturity date of June 30, 2018, and a one-year extension option.    

Three Hughes Landing 

During the third quarter 2014, we began construction of Three Hughes Landing, a Class A office building, and the building was placed in service August 1, 2016. Total estimated development costs are approximately $90 million, of which we have incurred $56.5 million as of September 30, 2016. The remaining development costs to be incurred relate to the estimated leasing and tenant build-out costs.   As of October 20, 2016,   the project is 9.2% leased, and leasing activity has been slower than our experience with One Hughes Landing and Two Hughes Landing due to the economic slowdown in Houston caused by lower oil prices. We believe that its lakefront location within the highly desirable Hughes Landing development and its related amenities will benefit this building as compared to competing office product in the north Houston region. We underwrote the project to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $7.6 million in 2018; however, the actual amount of NOI and year of stabilization will depend greatly on the Houston economy. The project is financed by a $65.5 million non-recourse construction loan bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.35% with an initial maturity date of December 5, 2017, with two, one-year extension options. 

Hospitality 

Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing  

This hotel, located adjacent to our Hughes Landing office buildings and in close proximity to Hughes Landing Retail, is benefiting from the business demand in the immediate area.   In the fourth quarter 2015, we substantially completed construction of the hotel. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $46 million, of which we have incurred $42.6 million as of September 30, 2016.     We expect to reach projected annual NOI of $4.5 million in 2018; however,   the actual amount of NOI will depend greatly on the timing and extent of recovery in the Houston economy  . The project is financed by a $37.1 million non-recourse construction loan bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.50% with an initial maturity date of October 2, 2018, and two, one-year extension options  .   

The Westin at The Woodlands 

In March 2016, we substantially completed construction of The Westin at The Woodlands.   Total development costs are expected to be approximately $97 million, of which we have incurred $90.4 million   as of September 30, 2016. NOI since opening in March is $0.6 million which is significantly below expectations due to the stagnant Houston economy caused by low oil prices. We continue to expect to reach projected annual NOI of approximately $10.5 million when the economy recovers; however, the actual amount of the NOI will depend greatly on the timing and extent of recovery of the Houston economy. The project is financed by a $69.3 million non-recourse construction loan bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.65% with an initial maturity date of August 6, 2018, and a one-year extension option.

The properties that are included in our Other Properties description in our Operating Assets NOI and REP EBT table include Kewalo Basin Harbor, Merriweather Post Pavilion (please refer to further discussion in the Strategic Development segment), and a participation interest in the Golf Courses at TPC Summerlin and TPC Las Vegas, as well as our share of any NOI related to our equity investments. We received $2.8 million as final payment for our participation interest in the Golf Courses at TPC Summerlin and TPC Las Vegas in June 2016, and the payment was recorded in Other income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.   

Partially Owned 

Grandview SHG, LLC 

In January 2016, we entered into a joint venture which purchased an operating hotel comprised of 72 rooms and totaling 43,889 square feet located at 33 Peck Slip in the Seaport District of New York City. Our total investment in the joint venture was $8.1 million as of September 30, 2016, inclusive of our $2.3 million share of equity contribution made in June 2016. A $25.0 million bridge loan, which we advanced to the joint venture in January 2016, was refinanced with a $36 million mortgage from a third party lender in June 2016. Subject to receiving the necessary permits, the hotel is scheduled to close late November for renovation which is anticipated to take approximately 10 months. 

Redevelopments    

The Seaport District    

The Seaport District includes the entire South Street Seaport, encompasses the waterfront along the East River, and is currently comprised of land and buildings located in an area we call the Uplands (which is west of FDR Drive) and Pier 17. We are in various phases of construction and development on multiple projects in the Seaport District as discussed below. 

Pier 17 Renovation Project, the Fulton Market Building and the Uplands     -   In 2013, the City of New York executed the amended and restated ground lease for South Street Seaport and we provided a completion guarantee to the City for the renovation and reconstruction of the Pier 17 Building ( Renovation Project ). Construction on the Pier 17 Renovation Project began in 2013 and is expected to be substantially completed in late 2017. The Renovation Project features a newly constructed pier and building and is designed to include upscale retail, restaurants and an outdoor entertainment venue on a vibrant open rooftop encompassing approximately 1.5 acres. Additionally, we are repositioning a significant portion of the 180,000 square feet of retail space in the Uplands, which includes the Fulton Market Building. In 2014, we entered into a 20-year lease with iPic Theaters for 46,000 square feet in the fully renovated Fulton Market Building. iPic Theater opened in October 2016 and is the first major anchor in the revitalized Seaport District. iPic is Manhattan s first new commercial multiplex movie theater opening in over a decade. We expect the Uplands to be substantially repositioned by late 2017. The total cost estimate for the Renovation Project, the Fulton Market Building and the Uplands is $514 million, net of $54.1 million of insurance proceeds received as of September 30, 2016. We have incurred $290.0 million of development costs on these various projects, inclusive of $10.3 million of demolition costs as well as $14.6 million of development-related marketing costs which were expensed as incurred. Due to the complex nature of the Pier 17 reconstruction, historic area renovation, the Superstorm Sandy remediation discussed further below, and leasing of the vacant space, our estimates of the total costs for the Renovation Project will likely be revised as the development progresses. 

Minor Modification and Tin Building Reconstruction          In October 2016, we received approval of our Pier 17 Minor Modification of the 2013 Uniform Land Use Review Procedure ( ULURP ) Approval which includes the reconstruction of the Tin Building. The Pier 17 Minor Modification also includes the demolition of the Link Building and head house structure for the Pier 17 building, installation of the same fa ade treatment on the western elevation that was previously approved for the new Pier 17 Building and the installation of a reconfigured service access drive. The Tin Building reconstruction includes cataloguing important historical elements of the Tin Building, deconstructing the Tin Building, demolishing and reconstructing the platform pier where the Tin Building currently sits and then reconstructing the Tin Building in a slightly different location in order to raise it out of the flood zone. Finally, the access drive will be extended around the Tin Building to create a one-way limited access drive for service vehicles for both the Tin Building and Pier

17. The project budget discussed above does not include any additional costs that will be incurred with respect to the reconstruction of the Tin Building as recently approved under the Minor Modification. 

Seaport District Leasing Activity   -    In September 2016, we announced that 10 Corso Como will open at the Seaport District. Founded in Milan in 1991 by style visionary and former fashion editor Carla Sozzani, 10 Corso Como pioneered a new retail model   the union of culture and commerce. 10 Corso Como New York will be located in the historic area of the Seaport District and contain approximately 13,000 square feet that will be designed by American artist Kris Ruhs. The New York store will be 10 Corso Como s only U.S. location and is consistent with the other offerings curated to date that will include culinary experiences from renowned restaurateurs Jean-Georges Vongerichten and the Momofuku Group led by David Chang, iPic Theaters, McNally Jackson Books and the new Pier 17 highlighted by its 1.5-acre rooftop that will be programmed year-round. 

Superstorm Sandy Insurance Recoveries   - On October 29, 2012, as a result of Superstorm Sandy, the South Street Seaport suffered significant damage due to flooding. We have collected $54.1 million in insurance proceeds through September 30, 2016 relating to our claim, inclusive of $6.2 million   received for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $0 and $0.3 million received for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30  , 2015  , respectively. The insurance proceeds   were recorded in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and are excluded from NOI  . The claim is in litigation because we are seeking recoveries greater than what the insurance companies have paid to date.   There can be no assurance regarding the recovery of any additional insurance proceeds. 

Strategic Developments 

Our Strategic Developments assets generally require substantial future development to achieve their highest and best use. Most of the properties and projects in this segment generate no revenues with the exception of our condominium projects for which we use percentage of completion accounting to recognize revenues during the construction phase. Our expenses relating to these assets are primarily related to costs associated with selling condominiums, development related marketing costs, operational costs associated with the IBM building, the information center and sales gallery for the entire Ward Village development, carrying costs, such as property taxes and insurance, and other ongoing costs related to maintaining assets in their present condition. If we decide to redevelop or develop a Strategic Developments asset, we would expect that, with the exception of the residential portion of our condominium projects, upon completion of development, the asset would be reclassified to the Operating Assets segment and NOI would become an important measure of its operating performance. 

Total revenue and expenses for the Strategic Developments segment are summarized as follows: 

(*)    For a reconciliation of Strategic Developments EBT to consolidated income (loss) before taxes, please refer to Note 16 -   Segments  .

Negative interest expense amounts are due to interest capitalized in our Strategic Developments segment related to Operating Assets segment debt and the Senior Notes.

The decrease in minimum rents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily related to Creekside Village Green and Hughes Landing Retail properties, which were substantially completed and placed in service during 2015.   In 2015, these properties were nearing completion but were still included in the Strategic Developments segment and contributed minimum rental revenues. 

The increase in condominium rights and unit sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 is primarily related to revenue recognition at our Anaha condominium project for which we began recognizing revenue in the second quarter 2015. As condominium projects advance towards completion, revenue is recognized on qualifying sales contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting. 

Condominium rights and unit costs of sales primarily represent development and construction costs relating to the revenues recognized on Waiea and Anaha sales in the first nine months of 2016 and which were generated primarily from Waiea sales for the same period in 2015.  

Other property operating costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are comparable to 2015 and relate to typical carrying costs for our assets held for development. The increase in other property operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily attributable to pre-opening costs at The Westin at The Woodlands, which was placed in service in March 2016, and other property operating costs related to our assets held for development.  

Demolition   costs in 2016 relate to the demolition of a building on the development site for Ae o, our third m  arket rate condominium tower in Ward Village, which began construction in the first quarter 2016. 

Development-related marketing costs are expenses incurred to enhance our brand, generate demand for our development and redevelopment projects and sustain consumer and industry relationships. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, development-related marketing costs decreased primarily due to fewer costs incurred at certain strategic development projects at Ward Village which are progressing towards completion. 

The increase in Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is related to our earnings from the sale of a certain land parcel at our Circle T Ranch joint venture in June 2016.   In 2015, our Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates represented our share of the earnings in the   ONE Ala Moana condominium venture for which all of the units available for sale have been sold and closed. 

The gain   on sale of the 80 South Street Assemblage is the result of the sale of this asset in March 2016. Please refer to   the discussion below regarding this sale. 

Interest, net decreased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 due to completing projects and placing them in service during 2015 and 2016.  

The following describes the status of our active Strategic Development projects as of September 30, 2016: 

Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District 

Within Downtown Columbia is the Merriweather District, which contains 35 developable acres owned by us.  

Merriweather District    

During the first quarter 2015 we received county approval of our development plan which allows for new development density up to 4.9 million square feet of office, residential and retail space. We are currently redeveloping the Merriweather Post Pavilion and developing One Merriweather and Two Merriweather office projects, the adjacent garage and the surrounding infrastructure, which are described below. 

Merriweather Post Pavilion     As part of obtaining the entitlements for the Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District, we agreed to redevelop the Merriweather Post Pavilion, an outdoor amenity capable of seating   more than 15,000 people in Downtown Columbia. The Merriweather Post Pavilion is currently included in Other in our Operating Assets segment. The total development costs are expected to be $26.8 million which includes $7.8 million of costs for special enhancements

that the Downtown Columbia Arts and Culture Commission ( DCACC ) has agreed to reimburse. We have incurred $17.8 million as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, the project has available financing in the form   of a $9.5 million promissory note with DCACC. The note bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 2.00% with a maximum rate of 4.00% and matures in October 2021, which includes a one-year extension option.  

One Merriweather        In the fourth quarter 2015, we received county approval for the construction of the first office building in the Merriweather District   One Merriweather. We began construction of One Merriweather, a 199,000 square foot, eight-story multiple tenant Class A office building which includes 12,500 leasable square feet of retail and restaurant space and the adjacent nine-story parking garage which will contain 1,129 spaces, during the fourth quarter 2015 and anticipate completion of the project in the fourth quarter 2016. Total estimated development costs are approximately $78 million, inclusive of approximately $15 million of construction costs related to the parking garage. As of September 30, 2016 we have incurred $47.1 million of development costs. As of October 20, 2016, 49.0% of the building is pre-leased to MedStar Health, the largest healthcare provider in the region. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $5.1 million in 2020. On February 25, 2016, we closed on a $49.9 million non-recourse construction loan for this project, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.15% with an initial maturity date of February 25, 2020 and a one-year extension option. 

Two Merriweather     We began   construction of Two Merriweather, a Class A mixed-use office building, in the third quarter 2016. Two Merriweather will consist of 100,000 square feet of office and 30,000 square feet of retail space. Total estimated development costs are approximately $41 million. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $3.3 million of development costs. As of October 20, 2016, 57.7% of the total project and 75.0% of the office space is pre-leased. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $3.6 million in 2020. On October 7, 2016, we closed on a $33.2 million non-recourse construction loan for this project, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.50% with an initial maturity date of October 7, 2020 and a one-year extension option. 

m.flats/TEN.M 

We are a 50% partner with Kettler to construct a 437-unit, Class A multi-family project with 29,000 square feet of ground floor retail which is adjacent to The Metropolitan Downtown Columbia in Columbia, Maryland. In the first quarter 2016, construction of the project began which includes two separate buildings, m.flats and TEN.M. Kettler provides construction and property management services for the development, and we anticipate the first units will be available for rent in the third quarter 2017. We expect the property to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $8.1 million in 2019, of which our share would be $4.0 million. In January 2016, the venture closed on an $88.0 million construction loan which is non-recourse to us and bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.40% with an initial maturity date of February 2020, and three one-year extension options.   At loan closing, our land contribution was valued at $53,500 per unit, or $23.4 million, and Kettler contributed $16.1 million in cash, of which $7.3 million was distributed to us. This transaction was accounted for as a partial sale of the land for which we recognized a net profit of $0.2 million. Total development costs are expected to be approximately   $108 million, of which the venture had incurred $26.8 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, $1.4 million of the construction loan is remaining to be drawn. We contributed $6.3 million to the joint venture as required by the loan agreement. 

Summerlin 

Constellation  

We entered into a joint venture with Calida to construct, own and operate a 124-unit gated luxury apartment development in Summerlin. We are a 50% partner with Calida and unanimous consent of the partners is required for all major decisions. The venture commenced construction in February 2015 and plans to open the project in stages. The first stage of the project was opened in September 2016  .   The remaining stages of the project are expected to be completed by the end of 2016. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $2.3 million in 2018, of which our share would be $1.15 million. Total estimated costs are $24 million, including land value, of which the venture had incurred $22.4 million as of September 30, 2016. The project is financed by a $15.8 million construction loan which is non-recourse to us, and $11.9 million is outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 2.50% and matures in February of 2018, with two, one-year extension options. Upon a sale of the property, we are entitled to 50% of the proceeds up to an amount determined by applying a 7.0% capitalization rate to the joint venture s NOI and then 100% of proceeds above that amount. As of October 20, 2016, the project is 54.0% leased.

The Woodlands  

Alden Bridge Self-Storage Facilities 

The Alden Bridge Self-Storage Facilities represent our first developments of this commercial property type and include a combined 1,441 units located on over seven acres, split between two locations.   

We began construction on HHC 242 Self Storage Facility located in Alden Bridge, a neighborhood within The Woodlands, in the third quarter 2015 and anticipate completion during the first quarter 2017. This facility is located on 4.0 acres and will comprise 657 units aggregating approximately 82,000 square feet. Total estimated costs are approximately $8.6 million, of which we have   incurred $5.4 million as of September 30, 2016. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $0.8 million in 2020. On October 23, 2015, we closed on a $6.7 million non-recourse construction loan for this facility, bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.60% with an initial maturity date of October 2019, and two, one-year extension options.  

We began construction on HHC 2978 Self Storage Facility, also located in Alden Bridge, in January 2016 and anticipate completion during the first quarter 2017. This facility is located on 3.1 acres and will comprise 784 units aggregating approximately 81,000 square feet.

Ward Village  

We continue to transform Ward Village into a vibrant neighborhood offering unique retail experiences, dining and entertainment, along with exceptional residences and workforce housing set among open public spaces and pedestrian-friendly streets.  

Since 2014, we completed the renovation of the IBM Building and started construction on Waiea, Anaha and Ae  '  o,  three of the first four mixed-use market rate residential towers. Additionally, during the third quarter 2016, we obtained approval to begin construction of Ke Kilohana. In July 2015, we began public presales for Ae  '  o and the first Gateway Tower,   and in March 2016, we began public presales for Ke Kilohana.     Sales contracts are subject to a 30-day rescission period, and the buyers are required to make an initial deposit at signing and an additional deposit 30 days later at which point their total deposit becomes non-refundable. Buyers are then required to make a final deposit within approximately 90 days of our receipt of their second deposit. Certain buyers are required to deposit the remainder of the sales price on a predetermined pre-closing date, which is specified in the sales contracts for each condominium project. 

Waiea   -   In 2014, we began construction on Waiea and expect to complete the condominium tower during the fourth quarter 2016. As of October   20  , 2016, 160 of the 174 total units were under contract. These contracted sales represent 92.0% of total units and 86.9% of the total residential square feet available for sale.     Total development costs are expected to be approximately $403 million, which includes $11.5 million of development-related marketing costs that are being expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $346.3 million of development costs, of which $9.2 million were development-related marketing costs. During the fourth quarter 2014, we met all the necessary requirements to begin recognizing revenue on the percentage of completion basis. As of September 30, 2016, the project was approximately 87.9% complete. In December 2015, we announced that world renowned restaurateur Nobu Matsuhisa will relocate his restaurant, Nobu, from its current Waikiki location to an approximately 8,000 square foot space at the base of Waiea.    

Anaha     In 2014, we began construction of Anaha, and we expect to complete the condominium tower during the second quarter 2017. As of October 20, 2016, 299 of the 317 total units were under contract. These contracted sales represent 94.3% of total units and 87.8% of the total residential square feet available for sale. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $401 million, which includes $8.6 million of development-related marketing costs that are being expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $207.8 million of development costs of which $6.9 million were development-related marketing costs. During the second quarter 2015, we met all the necessary requirements to begin recognizing revenue on the percentage of completion basis. As of September 30, 2016, the project was approximately 55.8% complete. As of October 20, 2016, 73.1% of the retail space at Anaha is pre-leased and is anchored by a Merriman s restaurant.

Waiea and Anaha have available financing for up to $600.0 million in the form of a non-recourse construction loan cross-collateralized by the condominium towers bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus 6.75% with an initial maturity date of November 6, 2017, and two, one-year extension options. In August 2016, the original financing agreement was modified. The modification allowed for an accelerated advance of $50.0 million of construction financing. The interest rate and maturity date remained unchanged.  

Ae  '  o     In February 2016, we began construction of the 389,000 square foot Ae  '  o tower and the 57,000 square foot Whole Foods Market, located on the same block. We expect to complete development of the entire project by the end of 2018. Total development costs are expected to be $429 million. We expect to secure financing by the end of this year. As of October 20, 2016, 258 of the 466 total units were under contract, representing 55.4% of total units and 48.8% of the total residential square feet available for sale. We have incurred $53.8 million of development costs on this project as of September 30, 2016. We expect to begin recognizing revenue using the percentage of completion method during the fourth quarter 2016.  

Ke Kilohana     In October 2016, we began construction of Ke Kilohana and anticipate completion by the second quarter 2019. The tower will consist of   424 residences, 375 of which are designated as workforce housing units and are being offered     to local residents of Hawaii who meet certain maximum income and net worth requirements  . Total development costs are expected to be $219 million, and we expect completion by the second quarter 2019. Public pre-sales on the workforce units began in the first quarter 2016, and 100% of those units were under contract by the end of July 2016. The market rate units began public pre-sales in July 2016. As of October 20, 2016, we sold 12 of the 49 units, and we expect to sell the remainder over the next two years. All units under contract represent 91.3% of the total units and 87.2% of the total residential square feet available for sale. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $11.1 million of pre-development costs on this project. As previously announced, we have pre-leased approximately 22,000 square feet to CVS/Longs Drugs on the ground floor of Ke Kilohana. We expect to secure financing by the end of the fourth quarter 2016.  

Gateway Towers     Construction of the two towers will be subject to obtaining an acceptable level of pre-sales and financing for the project. Pre-sales for the first residential tower containing 125 units began in July 2015. As expected, contracted unit sales in this tower have been slower than Waiea, Anaha and Ae  '  o because the pricing and marketing of these units is targeted towards a significantly smaller segment of the market. We have incurred $15.6 million of pre-development costs for the first tower as of September 30, 2016 and are finalizing the project budget. We continue pre-development activities of the second tower and have incurred $12.7 million for pre-development of this tower as of September 30, 2016.  

A ali i     In response to the strong demand for housing at lower price points in the Honolulu market, in September 2016 we announced plans to develop our next market rate tower,  A ali i.  A ali i will be a 42-story, 751 unit mixed-use condominium project located off of Queen Street next to Ae o and the flagship Whole Foods Market, which is currently under construction. The project will consist of studio, one and two bedroom residences and will include at least 100 workforce units under the Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) s Reserved Housing Program. The units will range from approximately 300 square feet to 900 square feet. Additionally, there will be up to 15,000 square feet of new street level retail and one acre of indoor and outdoor amenities for residents. We have submitted detailed plans to the HCDA and will hold our first public hearing in November 2016. Our goal is to obtain approvals by early 2017 and launch pre-sales later in the year. We are targeting to start construction at the end of 2017 or early 2018. We continue to finalize the development budget and seek financing for this project. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred $1.4 million of development costs.

Other Development Projects 

Circle T Ranch and Power Center 

We are a 50% partner in two joint ventures with Hillwood, a local Texas developer. The ventures are known as  Westlake Retail Associates, Ltd and 170 Retail Associates, and we have collectively referred to them as Circle T Ranch and Power Center. Both ventures contain an aggregate of approximately 279 acres. During the second quarter, we announced the launch of a 130-acre, mixed use development at the Westlake Retail Associates, Ltd venture. Our planned mixed use development will include more than 1.2 million square feet of Class A mixed use office, retail and entertainment space, as well as a 200-room hotel, and will be anchored by a 500,000 square foot corporate campus for Charles Schwab Corporation, one of the nation s largest financial service providers. On June 1, 2016, the Westlake Retail Associates venture closed on a 74.1 acre land sale with an affiliate of Charles Schwab Corporation, and as a result of the land sale, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the recognition of $10.5 million in Equity in earnings from Real Estate and Other Affiliates  .

On March 16, 2016, we sold the 80 South Street Assemblage for net cash proceeds of $378.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $140.5 million. The 80 South Street Assemblage was a 42,694 square foot lot with 817,784 square feet of available development rights.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes our projects under construction, and related debt, for Operating Assets and Strategic Developments as of September 30, 2016. Projects that are substantially complete and therefore have been placed in service in the Operating Assets segment may still require some capital for remaining tenant build-out. This table does not include projects for which construction is expected to start within the year.   

(a) 

Total Estimated Costs represent all costs to be incurred on the project which include construction costs, demolition costs, marketing costs, capitalized leasing, payroll or project development fees, deferred financing costs and advances for certain accrued costs from lenders and excludes land costs and capitalized corporate interest allocated to the project.  South Street Seaport Total Estimated Costs are shown net of insurance proceeds and Waiea, Anaha,   Ae'o  , Ke Kilohana, One Merriweather, and Two Merriweather exclude Master Plan infrastructure and amenity costs at Ward Village and Merriweather District.     

(b) 

Costs Paid Through September 30, 2016 represent those items included in Total Estimated Costs which have been paid.     

(c) 

Negative balances represent cash to be received in excess of Estimated Remaining to be Spent.  These items are primarily related to September costs that were paid by us but not yet reimbursed by the lender. We expect to receive funds from our lenders for these costs in the future.  Positive balances represent cash that remains to be invested or amounts drawn in advance of costs paid.     

(d) 

South Street Seaport Total Estimated Costs and Costs Paid Through September 30, 2016 are net of $47.9 million of insurance proceeds received.     

(e) 

1725-35 Hughes Landing Boulevard Total Estimated Costs include approximately $61 million of tenant improvements that were reimbursed by ExxonMobil. These Tenant Reimbursements are shown above as an additional source of funds for project costs. Asset was placed in service during November 2015.     

(f) 

Three Hughes Landing building is substantially shell complete and was placed in service in August 2016.  Final completion of the building is dependent upon lease-up and tenant build-out.     

(g) 

Lakeland Village Center was placed in service during the third quarter 2016.     

(h) 

The Westin at The Woodlands was placed in service in March 2016.     

(i) 

As of September 30, 2016, the entire project was under construction. Total development costs are expected to be $429 million. We are currently seeking financing for the project and expect to close on a $230.0 million construction loan in the fourth quarter 2016. We are also required to utilize up to $52.0 million of non-refundable buyer deposits for construction costs.      

59 

Table of Contents  

(j) 

Waiea and Anaha utilize nonrefundable buyer deposits to fund project costs prior to drawing on the loan. Waiea has utilized the required amount of nonrefundable buyer deposits, and Anaha currently has approximately $9.3 million of nonrefundable buyer deposits remaining to utilize towards construction costs. At Waiea, we will be required to escrow the remaining construction costs subsequent to condominium unit closings. We estimate those costs to be approximately $57.5 million.     

(m) 

In the third quarter 2016, Ke Kilohana was approved to begin construction. Total development costs are expected to be $219 million. We are currently seeking financing for the project and expect to close on a $142.7 million construction loan in the fourth quarter 2016. We also will be required to utilize non-refundable buyer deposits towards construction costs. As of September 30, 2016, we have received $18.3 million in non-refundable buyer deposits.      

(n) 

Construction began on Two Merriweather in the third quarter 2016. Total development costs are expected to be $41 million. We closed on a $33.2 million construction loan in October 2016.     

(o) 

The total anticipated financing for Ae`o includes a $230.0 million construction loan.     

(p) 

The total anticipated financing for Ke Kilohana includes a $142.7 million construction loan.

Table of Contents  

The following tables represent our capitalized internal costs by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

MPC segment capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) increased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to increased capitalization of occupancy-related costs.   

Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) have decreased at our Operating Assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to lower staff allocations with respect to our properties undergoing redevelopment.  

Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) have decreased at our Strategic Developments segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to projects placed in service during 2015 and 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, capitalized internal costs at our Strategic Developments segment increased primarily due to projects under development at Ward Village and Columbia, Maryland which began incurring a larger extent of development costs in 2016.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our primary sources of cash include cash flow from land sales in our MPC segment, cash generated from our operating assets and sales of properties, condominium closings, deposits from condominium sales (which are restricted to funding construction of the related developments), first mortgage financings secured by our assets and the corporate bond markets. Additionally, sales of certain assets where we deem such a sale to be the best strategic option may provide significant proceeds to our operating or investing activities. Our primary uses of cash include working capital, overhead, debt service, property improvements, acquisitions and development costs. We believe that our sources of cash, including existing cash on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing non-discretionary obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next twelve months. The development and redevelopment opportunities in our Operating Assets and Strategic Developments segments are capital intensive and will require significant additional funding, if and when pursued. In addition, we typically must provide completion guarantees to lenders in connection with their providing financing for our developments. We also provided a completion guarantee to the City of New York for the Pier 17 renovation project. We currently intend to raise this additional funding with a mix of construction, bridge and long-term financings, by entering into joint venture arrangements and the sale of non-core assets at the appropriate time. 

As of September 30, 2016, our consolidated debt was $2.8 billion and our share of the debt of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates was $54.7 million. Please refer to Note 9     Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable   to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a table showing our debt maturity dates.

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes our Net Debt on a segment basis as of September 30, 2016. Net Debt is defined as our share of mortgages, notes and loans payable, at our ownership share, reduced by short-term liquidity sources to satisfy such obligations such as our ownership share of cash and cash equivalents and SID receivables. Although Net Debt is not a recognized GAAP financial measure, it is readily computable from existing GAAP information and we believe, as with our other non-GAAP measures, that such information is useful to our investors and other users of our financial statements. 

(a) 

Please refer to Note 16 -   Segments  .     

(b) 

Includes MPC cash and cash equivalents, including $45.1 million of cash related to The Summit joint venture.      

(c) 

Includes our $48.8 million share of debt of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates in Operating Assets segment: Grandview SHG, LLC; Woodlands Sarofim; Clark County Las Vegas Stadium and The Metropolitan Downtown Columbia Project.      

(d) 

Includes our $5.9 million share of debt related to the Constellation joint venture.     

(e) 

Includes our $7.7 million share of cash and cash equivalents of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates in Operating Assets segment: Grandview SHG, LLC; Woodlands Sarofim; Clark County Las Vegas Stadium; The Metropolitan Downtown Columbia Project and Stewart Title.     

(f) 

Includes our $3.9 million share of cash and cash equivalent of our Real Estate and Other Affiliates in Strategic Developments segment: Circle T Ranch and Power Center; KR Holdings; HHMK Development; m.flats and Constellation.     

Cash Flows    

Operating Activities  

The cash flows and earnings generated from each business segment s activities vary significantly from period to period given the changing nature of our activities and development focus. Condominium deposits received from contracted units offset by other various cash uses related to condominium development and sales activities are a substantial portion of our operating activities in 2016. Condominium expenditures in excess of deposits received are funded with construction loans included in financing activities. As in prior periods, operating cash continues to be utilized to fund ongoing development expenditures in our Strategic Development and MPC segments.  

The cash flows and earnings from the MPC business are more variable than from our operating assets because the MPC business generates revenues from land sales rather than recurring contractual revenues from operating leases. MPC land sales are a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities and are partially offset by development costs associated with the land sales business and acquisitions of land that is intended to ultimately be developed and sold.  

Net cash used in operating activities was $218.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The $251.0 million net decrease in cash from operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to September 30, 2015 was primarily related to the following:  

Decreases in operating cash flow:  

Greater Condominium expenditures of $108.2 million;     

Decrease in Condominium deposits released from escrow of $114.5 million;     

Increase in uncapitalized interest costs of $5.9 million;      

Lower MPC land sales closed of $26.0 million; and     

Increase in income tax payments of $3.6 million.     

62 

Table of Contents  

Increases in operating cash flow:    

Dividends from equity method investments increased $8.3 million;     

Decreased MPC land acquisitions and expenditures of $28.8 million compared to the same period in 2015;     

Proceeds from Superstorm Sandy insurance of $3.1 million.     

Investing Activities  

Net cash provided by investing activities was $65.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash used in investing activities of $470.8 million for the period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $536.7 million was primarily due to the receipt of $378.3 million in net proceeds from the sale of the 80 South Street Assemblage, and $186.9 million less expended as a result of fewer commercial property developments. These increases were partially offset by an investment of $8.2 million relating to the Grandview     SHG  , LLC joint venture.   

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $360.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash provided of $328.3 million for the period ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $31.8 million in net cash provided is primarily due to lower net proceeds from new loan borrowings and refinancing activities of $52.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of $22.9 million in scheduled amortization payments on debt.  

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements  

We do not have any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Although we have interests in certain property owning non-consolidated ventures which have mortgage financings totaling $123.6 million as of September 30, 2016, these financings are non-recourse to us. 

Seasonality 

Generally, revenues from our Master Planned Communities segment, Operating Assets segment, and Strategic Developments segment are not subject to seasonal variations. Our hospitality revenues are seasonal based upon the timing of special events which occur more frequently in the Spring and Fall because of favorable weather conditions, and rental incomes for certain retail tenants are subject to overage rent terms, which are based on tenant sales. These retail tenants are generally subject to seasonal variations, with a significant portion of their sales and earnings occurring during the last two months of the year. As such, our rental income is higher in the fourth quarter of each year. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE   AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate financings in that increases in interest rates will increase our payments under these variable rates. We intend to manage a portion of our variable interest rate exposure by using interest rate swaps and caps. With respect to fixed-rate financings, increases in interest rates could make it more difficult to refinance such debt when due. As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.7 billion of variable rate debt outstanding of which $183.0 million has been swapped to a fixed-rate. Approximately $175.0 million of the $1.5 billion that has not been swapped to a fixed-rate is represented by the Master Credit Facility at The Woodlands and is subject to an interest rate cap having a $100.0 million notional amount to mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates. We also did not swap $119.4 million of the outstanding balance on the Ward Village financing to a fixed-rate because the loan is structured to permit partial repayments to release collateral for redevelopment. Due to the uncertain timing of such partial repayments, hedging   

63 

Table of Contents  

this portion of the outstanding balance is inefficient. $384.7 million of variable rate debt relates to our projects under construction. As the properties are placed in service and become stabilized, the variable rate debt is generally refinanced with long-term fixed-rate debt. We also have $250.0 million in gross notional amounts of forward-starting interest rate swaps that become effective December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, annual interest costs would increase approximately $15.3 million for every 1.00% increase in floating interest rates. A portion of our interest expense is capitalized due to the level of assets we currently have under development; therefore, the current impact of a change in our interest rate on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) would be less than the total change, but we would incur higher cash payments. For additional information concerning our debt and management s estimation process to arrive at a fair value of our debt as required by GAAP, please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of  Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , Note 8     Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable   and Note 13     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   in our Annual Report.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS   AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As required by SEC rules, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II   OTHER INFORMATIO  N  

ITEM 1.    LEGAL   PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of our business, we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings related to the ownership and operations of our properties. Neither we nor any of our real estate affiliates are currently involved in any legal or administrative proceedings that we believe is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTOR  S
