PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Item 1.  Financial Statements 

The accompanying information has not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm; however, in the opinion of management such information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period.  All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.  Premier Financial Bancorp, Inc. s ( Premier s ) accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Certain accounting principles used by Premier involve a significant amount of judgment about future events and require the use of estimates in their application.  The following policies are particularly sensitive in terms of judgments and the extent to which estimates are used: allowance for loan losses, the identification and evaluation of impaired loans and the impairment of goodwill.  These estimates are based on assumptions that may involve significant uncertainty at the time of their use.  However, the policies, the estimates and the estimation process as well as the resulting disclosures are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and material estimates are subject to review as part of the external audit by the independent registered public accounting firm.

The accompanying financial statements are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all of the disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or those normally made in the registrant s  annual report on Form 10-K .  Accordingly, the reader of the Form 10-Q may wish to refer to the registrant s  Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015  for further information in this regard.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The ASU creates a new topic, Topic 606, to provide guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in April 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year making the amendments effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods.  Companies have the option to apply ASU 2014-09 as of the original effective date. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The ASU makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10 including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  This standard   requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing requirements for leases that were historically classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles. This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  This ASU will require recognition of the income tax effects of share-based awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled (i.e., Additional Paid-in-Capital pools will be eliminated). The guidance in this ASU will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .  This ASU replaces the measurement for credit losses from a probable incurred estimate with an expected future loss estimate, which is referred to as the  current expected credit loss  or  CECL .  The standard pertains to financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans, debt securities classified as held-to-maturity,  and certain other contracts.  The largest impact will be on the allowance for loan and lease losses.  This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements.

Securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2015 aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:

The investment portfolio is predominately high credit quality interest-bearing bonds with defined maturity dates backed by the U.S. Government or Government sponsored entities.  The unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are price changes resulting from changes in the interest rate environment and are considered to be temporary declines in the value of the securities.   Management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery.  Their fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date and/or market conditions improve.

Purchased Impaired Loans

The Company holds purchased loans for which there was, at their acquisition date, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since their origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected.  The carrying amount of those loans is as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

For those purchased loans disclosed above, the Company did not increase the allowance for loan losses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, nor did it increase the allowance for loan losses for purchased impaired loans during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

For those purchased loans disclosed above, where the Company can reasonably estimate the cash flows expected to be collected on the loans, a portion of the purchase discount is allocated to an accretable yield adjustment based upon the present value of the future estimated cash flows versus the current carrying value of the loan and the accretable yield portion is being recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan.

Where the Company cannot reasonably estimate the cash flows expected to be collected on the loans, it has continued to account for those loans using the cost recovery method of income recognition.  As such, no portion of a purchase discount adjustment has been determined to meet the definition of an accretable yield adjustment on those loans accounted for using the cost recovery method.  If, in the future, cash flows from the borrower(s) can be reasonably estimated, a portion of the purchase discount would be allocated to an accretable yield adjustment based upon the present value of the future estimated cash flows versus the current carrying value of the loan and the accretable yield portion would be recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan.  Until such accretable yield can be calculated, under the cost recovery method of income recognition, all payments will be used to reduce the carrying value of the loan and no income will be recognized on the loan until the carrying value is reduced to zero.  The carrying value of these loans totals $396,000 at September 30, 2016, including $347,000 acquired from Bankshares.  Any loan accounted for under the cost recovery method is also included as a non-accrual loan in the amounts presented in the Past Due and Non-performing Loans section below.

The accretable yield, or income expected to be collected, on the purchased loans above is as follows at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

As part of the acquisition of First National Bankshares Corporation ( Bankshares ) on January 15, 2016, the Company purchased credit impaired loans for which it was probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments would not be collected.  The contractually required payments of such loans totaled $10,040,000, while the cash flow expected to be collected at acquisition totaled $8,437,000 and the fair value of the acquired loans totaled $7,286,000.

Past Due and Non-performing Loans

The following tables present the recorded investment in nonaccrual and loans past due over 90 days still on accrual by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The recorded investment in non-accrual loans is less than the principal owed on non-accrual loans due to discounts applied to the carrying value of the loan at time of their acquisition and interest payments made by the borrower which have been used to reduce the recorded investment in the loan rather than recognized as interest income.

Nonaccrual loans and impaired loans are defined differently.  Some loans may be included in both categories, and some may only be included in one category.  Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") when loan terms are modified due to a borrower's financial difficulties and a concession is granted to a borrower that would not have otherwise been considered. Most of the Company s loan modifications involve a restructuring of loan terms prior to maturity to temporarily reduce the payment amount and/or to require only interest for a temporary period, usually up to six months.  These modifications generally do not meet the definition of a TDR because the modifications are considered to be an insignificant delay in payment.  The determination of an insignificant delay in payment is evaluated based on the facts and circumstances of the individual borrower(s).

The following table presents TDR s as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

At September 30, 2016 $227,000 in specific reserves were allocated to loans that had restructured terms.  At December 31, 2015 there were no specific reserves allocated to loans that had restructured terms.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no commitments to lend additional amounts to these borrowers.

The following tables present TDR s that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and three months ended September 30, 2016.  During the three months ending September 30, 2015, no new TDR s occurred.

The modifications reported above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 involve reducing the borrowers  required monthly payment by offering extended interest only periods that exceed the timeframes customarily offered by the Company and/or lengthening the amortization period for loan repayment, each in an effort to help the borrowers keep their loan current.  The modifications did not include a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loans and did not decrease the stated interest rate on loans.   The Company increased the allowance for loan losses related to these loans by $35,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and by $204,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The modification of the multifamily residential real estate loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 did not include a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan and did not increase the allowance for loan losses during the period. The modification included a lengthening of the amortization period and reduction in the stated interest rate; however the maturity date was reduced to the end of a fifteen month forbearance period with a balloon payment due at maturity. The modified loan paid in full during the three months ended June 30, 2015.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were no TDR s for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification.

A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.

Credit Quality Indicators:

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as:  current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial, commercial real estate, multifamily residential and commercial purpose loans secured by residential real estate, on a monthly basis.  For consumer loans, including consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the analysis involves monitoring the performing status of the loan.  At the time such loans become past due by 30 days or more, the Company evaluates the loan to determine if a change in risk category is warranted. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:

Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date.

Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

NOTE  4- STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY AND REGULATORY MATTERS

The Company s principal source of funds for dividend payments to shareholders is dividends received from the subsidiary Banks.  Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies.  Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits, as defined, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements and additional restrictions as discussed below.  During 2016 the Banks could, without prior approval, declare dividends to the Company of approximately $1.1 million plus any 2016 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.

The Company and the subsidiary Banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Banks must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.

These quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 Capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined).  Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016 the Company and the Banks meet all quantitative capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

Beginning in 2016, a new 2.50% capital conservation buffer is being phased-in over the next three-years as a component of regulatory capital.  The capital conservation buffer percentage required in 2016 is an additional 0.625% added to the minimum capital ratios, and will be increased by an additional 0.625% each year until fully phased-in in 2019.  By maintaining Premier s regulatory capital ratios in excess of the phased-in capital buffer, the Company will avoid regulatorily imposed limitations on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to management.  Premier s capital conservation buffer over the minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio at September 30, 2016 was 6.77%, compared to the 0.625% required at September 30, 2016 and the 2.50% fully phased-in capital buffer beginning on January 1, 2019.

NOTE 5   FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES

As part of the acquisition of Bankshares, the Company assumed five amortizing advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh to First National Bank, its wholly owned subsidiary, totaling $1,261,000 as of the January 15, 2016 acquisition date.  Since acquisition the company has paid off four of the advances leaving one remaining borrowing which includes a stated fixed interest rate of 4.930%, a penalty for prepayment, and a maturity date of December 2024.  The advance is collateralized by FHLB stock and qualifying first mortgage loans owned by the Company.  The carrying value of the advance includes the remaining unamortized fair value adjustments recorded as a result of the acquisition of Bankshares on January 15, 2016.  Reported interest expense on the  advances includes the periodic accretion  of the fair value adjustments.  Principal payments on the remaining advance over the next five years are as follows:

NOTE  6   SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

As part of the acquisition of Bankshares, the Company formally assumed $6,186,000 of junior subordinated debentures ( Debentures ) issued to FNB Capital Trust One ( Trust ), a statutory business trust formed by Bankshares on February 26, 2004.  The Debentures were issued to Trust in exchange for ownership of all of the common equity of Trust and the proceeds of mandatorily redeemable securities sold by Trust to third party investors ( Capital Securities ).  Interest on the Debentures is payable quarterly to the Trust at a variable interest rate equal to the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.95% updated quarterly.   The interest rate on the Debentures was 3.665% at September 30, 2016.   The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of this trust (variable interest entity), therefore Trust is not consolidated in the Company s financial statements, but rather the Debentures are shown as a liability.  The Debentures mature on April 24, 2034; however, the Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.  The Debentures held by Trust are the sole asset of the trust.  The Debentures held by Trust may be included in the Tier 1 capital of the Company (with certain limitations applicable) under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.

The carrying value of the Debentures includes the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded as a result of the acquisition of Bankshares on January 15, 2016.  Reported interest expense on the Debentures includes the periodic amortization of the fair value adjustment.  The Company s investment in the common stock of the trust is $186,000 and is included in other assets.

NOTE  7   STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE

From time to time the Company grants stock options to its employees.  The Company estimates the fair value of the options at the time they are granted to employees and expenses that fair value over the vesting period of the option grant.  From time to time the Company also grants shares of stock to its employees.  The Company uses the closing price of the stock on the date of grant to determine the amount of compensation expense to record as a result of the stock grant.

On March 16, 2016, 50,900 incentive stock options were granted out of the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $14.90, the closing market price of Premier s common stock on the grant date.  These options vest in three equal annual installments ending on March 16, 2019.  On March 18, 2015, 47,650 incentive stock options were granted out of the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $14.72, the closing market price of Premier s common stock on the grant date.  These options vest in three equal annual installments ending on March 18, 2018.

On March 16, 2016, 7,000 shares of Premier s common stock were granted to President and CEO, Robert W. Walker as stock-based bonus compensation under the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan.  The fair value of the stock at the time of the grant was $14.90 per share based upon the closing price of Premier s stock on the date of grant and $104,000 of stock-based compensation was recorded as a result.  On March 18, 2015, 7,000 shares of Premier s common stock were granted to President and CEO, Robert W. Walker as stock-based bonus compensation under the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan.  The fair value of the stock at the time of the grant was $14.72 per share based upon the closing price of Premier s stock on the date of grant and $103,000 of stock-based compensation was recorded as a result.

Compensation expense of $160,000 was recorded for the first nine months of 2016 while $188,000 was recorded for the first nine months of 2015, including the compensation expense related to the stock grants to Mr. Walker.  Stock-based compensation expense related to incentive stock option grants is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period for all awards. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options totaled $63,000 at September 30, 2016. This unrecognized expense is expected to be recognized over the next 29 months based on the vesting periods of the options.

NOTE  9   FAIR VALUE

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to observable market data for similar assets and liabilities. However, certain assets and liabilities are not traded in observable markets and the Company must use other valuation methods to develop a fair value.

Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully.  It was not practicable to determine the fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to the restrictions placed on its transferability.  For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk.  Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or underlying collateral values.  Fair value of debt is based on current rates for similar financing. The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is not material.

The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument measured on a recurring basis:

Investment Securities:  The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 

The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument measured on a non-recurring basis:

Impaired Loans:  The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent collateral appraisals. Real estate appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and unique to each property and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports. Management periodically evaluates the appraised collateral values and will discount the collateral s appraised value to account for a number of factors including but not limited to the cost of liquidating the collateral, the age of the appraisal, observable deterioration since the appraisal, management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, or other factors unique to the collateral.  To the extent an adjusted collateral value is lower than the carrying value of an impaired loan, a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is assigned to the loan.

Other real estate owned (OREO):  The fair value of OREO is based on appraisals less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Management periodically evaluates the appraised values and will discount a property s appraised value to account for a number of factors including but not limited to the cost of liquidating the collateral, the age of the appraisal, observable deterioration since the appraisal, or other factors unique to the property. To the extent an adjusted appraised value is lower than the carrying value of an OREO property, a direct charge to earnings is recorded as an OREO writedown.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016 are summarized below:

Impaired loans, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a carrying amount of $1,289,000 at September 30, 2016 with a valuation allowance of $523,000 and a carrying amount of $690,000 at December 31, 2015 with a valuation allowance of $299,000.  The change resulted in a provision for loan losses of $215,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an $136,000 provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and a $24,000 provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a $18,000 provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The detail of impaired loans by loan class is contained in  Note 3  above.

Other real estate owned measured at fair value less costs to sell, had a net carrying amount of $7,541,000 which is made up of the outstanding balance of $10,758,000 net of a valuation allowance of $3,217,000 at September 30, 2016.  There were $478,000 of additional write downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $614,000 of additional write downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 there were $478,000 of additional write downs compared to $368,000 of additional write downs during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  At December 31, 2015, other real estate owned had a net carrying amount of $8,059,000, made up of the outstanding balance of $10,825,000, net of a valuation allowance of $2,766,000.

NOTE  10   ACQUISITION OF FIRST NATIONAL BANKSHARES CORPORATION

Effective at the close of business on January 15, 2016, Premier completed its purchase of First National Bankshares Corporation ( Bankshares ), a $237.5 million single bank holding company headquartered in Ronceverte, West Virginia.  Under terms of an agreement of merger dated July 6, 2015, Premier issued 1.69 shares of its common stock for each share of Bankshares for a total acquisition value of approximately $22.0 million.  Based on the preliminary valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the purchase price resulted in approximately $3.32 million in goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.  During the period following the acquisition through the quarter ended September 30, 2016, management obtained information regarding its initial valuations that resulted in increases in the fair value of the premises acquired, the estimated core deposit intangible, and related deferred taxes.  These adjustments decreased the amount of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition to approximately $1.57 million, consisting largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies. The core deposit intangible asset was revised to a total of $3.31 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.  The core deposit intangible will be amortized using an accelerated method.  The following table presents estimated amortization of the Bankshares core deposit intangible as of the acquisition date for each of the next five years.

The valuations of loans, premises and equipment and core deposit intangible are still preliminary and subject to change.  United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) provide up to twelve months following the date of acquisition in which management can finalize the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Material events that occur during the measurement period will be analyzed to determine if the new information reflected facts and circumstances that existed on the acquisition date. The measurement period ends as soon as the Company receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns more information is unobtainable. The measurement period is limited to one year from the acquisition date. Once management has finalized the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities within this twelve month period, management considers such values to be the  Day One Fair Values.   Based on management s preliminary valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the purchase price for the Bankshares acquisition is allocated in the table below.  There were no recast adjustments during the third quarter of 2016.

Net assets acquired via the acquisition are shown in the table below.

The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows.  However, the Company believes that all contractual cash flows related to these non-impaired financial instruments will be collected.  As such, these receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to the accounting guidance relating to purchase credit impaired loans, which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination.  The non-impaired loans excluded from the purchase credit impairment guidance were recorded at an estimated fair value of $125,669,000 and had gross contractual amounts receivable of $127,347,000 on the date of acquisition.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis 

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. However, such performance involves risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These important factors include, but are not limited to, economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets in which Premier operates), competition for Premier's customers from other providers of financial services, government legislation and regulation (which changes from time to time), changes in interest rates, Premier's ability to originate quality loans, collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits, the impact of Premier's growth, Premier's ability to control costs, and new accounting pronouncements, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Premier.  The words  may,   could,   should,   would,   will,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   plan,   project,   predict,   continue  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

A.    Results of Operations 

A financial institution s primary sources of revenue are generated by interest income on loans, investments and other earning assets, while its major expenses are produced by the funding of these assets with interest bearing liabilities.  Effective management of these sources and uses of funds is essential in attaining a financial institution s optimal profitability while maintaining a minimum amount of interest rate risk and credit risk.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,767,000, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9,594,000, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in income in 2016 is largely due to an increase in the provision for loan losses compared to the first nine months of 2015 and an increase in operating expenses from the operations of the acquired First National Bank ( First National ), which were not included in Premier s 2015 results.  First National, a wholly owned subsidiary of First National Bankshares Corporation ( Bankshares ) headquartered in Ronceverte, West Virginia, was purchased as part of Premier s acquisition of Bankshares on January 15, 2016.  Premier issued 1.4 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately $22,041,000 to the shareholders of Bankshares.  On March 4, 2016, as part of Premier s assimilation of Bankshares, First National was converted to Premier s operating systems and merged into Premier Bank, Inc., a wholly own subsidiary of Premier.  The six branches of First National became branches of Premier Bank and now comprise the bank s second largest operating division.  The operations of First National s six branches plus the operations of Bankshares are only included in the operations of Premier since the January 15, 2016 acquisition date.  The decrease in net income related to the provision for loan losses is a result of an $1,436,000 of provision expense recorded during the first nine months of 2016, which compares to $232,000 of provision for loan losses recorded during the first nine months of 2015.  The increase in the provision for loan losses during the first nine months of 2016 was due to two primary factors, a $51.2 million, or 6.0%, increase in loans outstanding (exclusive of the loans acquired via the purchase of Bankshares) and an estimate for the potential loan losses related to the June, 2016 flooding that occurred in some of Premier s West Virginia markets.  The annualized returns on average common shareholders  equity and average assets were approximately 6.71% and 0.79% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 8.66% and 1.01%% for the same period in 2015.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,164,000, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3,325,000, or $0.40 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in net income during the third quarter of 2016 is largely due to a $1,522,000 increase in non-interest expense and a $150,000 increase in interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 that were not fully offset by the $1,083,000 increase in interest income and the $260,000 increase in non-interest income when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The comparative increase in interest income in the third quarter of 2016 is negatively impacted  by a higher amount of income recognized from deferred income and discounts recognized  on non-accrual loans that paid off during the third quarter  of 2015, compared to the third quarter of 2016.  The annualized returns on average common shareholders  equity and average assets were approximately 7.10% and 0.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 9.04% and 1.05% for the same period in 2015.

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $40.262 million, up $3.592 million or 9.8%, from the $36.670 million of net interest income earned in the first nine months of 2015, as an increase in interest income more than offset an increase in interest expense.  Interest income in 2016 increased by $3.991 million, or 10.0%, largely due to a $5.322 million increase in interest income from the operations of First National.  This increase in interest income was partially offset by a $872,000, or 2.2%, decrease in interest income from Premier s other operations and a $459,000 decrease in income recognized from deferred interest and  discounts  collected on non-accrual loans that liquidated during first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  The timing of these liquidations is difficult to predict, which creates fluctuations in reported loan interest income.  Interest income on loans increased by $3.272 million, or 9.1%, due to the addition of $4.631 million of interest income on loans added via the acquisition of First National, partially offset by a $900,000 decrease in interest income on loans from Premier s other operations and the $459,000 decrease in income recognized from deferred interest and  discounts collected on non-accrual loans.  Interest earned on investments increased by $528,000, or 13.9%, due to the addition of approximatley $650,000 of interest income on investments added via the acquisition of First National, partially offset by a $122,000 decrease in interest income on investments from Premier s other operations.  Interest earned on federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances increased by $191,000 largely due to higher yields earned on these highly liquid assets.

Interest expense increased in total during the first nine months of 2016 by $399,000, or 13.0%, when compared to the same nine months of 2015.  Interest expense increased by $769,000 due to the addition of the operations acquired from Bankshares, including $588,000 of interest expense on the deposits and borrowings of First National and $181,000 of interest expense on subordinated debentures assumed by Premier as part of the acquisition of Bankshares.  The subordinated debentures can be included as a portion of Premier s regulatory Tier 1 capital, subject to certain conditions and limitations.  Partially offsetting the $769,000 increase in interest expense from the addition of the operations acquired from Bankshares was a $370,000, or 12.0%, decrease in interest expense from Premier s other operations largely due to a $305,000, or 11.5%, decrease in interest expense on deposits and a $70,000, or 17.9%, decrease in interest expense on other borrowings.

Premier s net interest margin during the first nine months of 2016 was 3.92% compared to 4.19% for the same period in 2015.  Impacting the comparison of Premier s net interest margin in 2016 with its net interest margin in 2015 are the assets and liabilities acquired via the Bankshares purchase, which generated additional net interest income in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the net interest income in the first nine months of 2015 but not necessarily at the same net interest margin as Premier s historical yields.  As shown in the table below, while Premier s yield earned on federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances increased to 0.66% in the first nine months of 2016, the average yield earned on securities available for sale and total loans outstanding both decreased when compared to the first nine months of 2015, largely due to the acquired earning assets of First National.  However, the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased very little in the first nine months of 2016, as decreases in the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and other borrowings were partially offset by higher average rates paid on the FHLB advances and subordinated debentures assumed in the acquisition of Bankshares.  The overall effect was to reduce Premier s net interest spread by 26 basis points to 3.80% and its net interest margin by 27 basis points to 3.92% in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the first nine months of 2015.

Additional information on Premier s net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 and third quarter of 2015 is contained in the following table.

Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 totaled $13.716 million, up $933,000, or 7.3%, from the $12.783 million of net interest income earned in the third quarter of 2015, as an increase in interest income more than offset an increase in interest expense.  Interest income in the third quarter of 2016 increased by $1.083 million, or 7.9%, largely due to a $1.720 million increase in interest income from the operations of First National.  This increase in interest income was partially offset by a $108,000, or 0.7%, decrease in interest income from Premier s other operations and a $529,000 decrease in income recognized from deferred interest and discounts  collected on non-accrual loans liquidated during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Interest income on loans increased by $869,000, or 6.9%, due to the addition of $1.502 million of interest income on loans added via the acquisition of First National, partially offset by a $104,000 decrease in interest income on loans from Premier s other operations and the $529,000 decrease in income recognized from deferred interest and discounts collected on non-accrual loans.  Interest earned on investments increased by $140,000, or 11.4%, due to the addition of approximately $208,000 of interest income on investments added via the acquisition of First National, partially offset by a $68,000 decrease in interest income on investments from Premier s other operations.  Interest earned on federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances increased by $74,000 largely due to higher yields earned on these highly liquid assets.

Interest expense increased in total during the third quarter of 2016 by $150,000, or 15.0%, when compared to the same quarter of 2015.  Interest expense increased by $250,000 due to the addition of the operations acquired from Bankshares, including $187,000 of interest expense on the deposits and borrowings of First National and $63,000 of interest expense on subord inated debentures assumed by Premier as part of the acquisition of Bankshares.  Partially offsetting the $250,000 increase in interest expense from the addition of the operations acquired from Bankshares was a $100,000, or 10.0%, decrease in interest expense from Premier s other operations largely due to a $75,000, or 8.7%, decrease in interest expense on deposits and a $31,000, or 23.5%, decrease in interest expense on other borrowings. 

Premier s net interest margin during the third quarter of 2016 was 3.91% compared to 4.35% for the same period in 2015.  Impacting the comparison of Premier s net interest margin in 2016 with its net interest margin in 2015 are the assets and liabilities acquired via the Bankshares purchase, which generated additional net interest income in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the net interest income in the third quarter of 2015 but not necessarily at the same net interest margin as Premier s historical yields.  As shown in the table above, while Premier s yield earned on federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances increased to 0.71% in the third quarter of 2016, the average yield earned on securities available for sale and total loans outstanding both decreased when compared to the third quarter of 2015, largely due to the acquired earning assets of First National.  However, the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased very little in the third quarter of 2016, as decreases in the average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and other borrowings were partially offset by higher average rates paid on the FHLB advances and subordinated debentures assumed in the acquisition of Bankshares.  The overall effect was to reduce Premier s net interest spread by 44 basis points to 3.78% and its net interest margin by 44 basis points to 3.91% in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of 2015.

Non-interest income increased by $795,000, or 15.1%, to $6,064,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $235,000, or 8.6%, electronic banking income (income from debit/credit cards, ATM fees and internet banking charges) increased by $339,000, or 16.8%, and income from other sources increased by $221,000, or 43.1%, including a $65,000 increase in commissions from selling mortgages in the secondary market.  The increases in non-interest income are largely due to the inclusion of the operations of First National in 2016, which added approximately $662,000 of non-interest income in the first nine months of 2016.

For the quarter ending September 30, 2016, non-interest income increased by $260,000, or 14.4%, to $2,062,000 compared to $1,802,000 recognized during the same quarter of 2015.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $83,000, or 8.8%, electronic banking income increased by $121,000, or 18.1%, secondary market mortgage income increased by $26,000, and non-interest income from other sources increased by $30,000.  The increases in non-interest income are largely due to the inclusion of the operations of First National in 2016, which added approximately $183,000 of non-interest income in the third quarter of 2016.

Non-interest expenses for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $31.32 million, or 2.82% of average assets on an annualized basis, compared to $26.81 million, or 2.83% of average assets for the same period of 2015.  The $4,513,000 increase in non-interest expenses in 2016 when compared to the first nine months of 2015 is largely due to a $3,520,000 increase in non-interest expense from the operations of the six branches of First National and $196,000 of expenses directly incurred to convert First National s operating and data systems.  In addition to these expenses, non-interest expense increased by $797,000, or 3.0%, as a result of Premier s other operations.  Largely as a result of the First National operations, staff costs increased by $2,060,000, or 15.9%, occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $779,000, or 19.9%, data processing costs (excluding conversion costs) increased by $660,000, or 20.2%, amortization of intangible assets increased by $218,000, or 33.9%, FDIC insurance costs increased by $99,000, or 15.2%, and other operating expenses increased by $450,000, or 14.9%.

Non -interest expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $10.61 million, or 2.79% of average assets on an annualized basis, compared to $9.09 million, or 2.85% of average assets for the same period of 2015.  The $1,522,000 increase in non-interest expenses in the third quarter  of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015 is largely due to a $998,000 increase in non-interest expense from the operations of the six branches of First National.  In addition to these expenses, non-interest expense increased by $524,000, or 5.8%, as a result of Premier s other operations.  Largely as a result of the First National operations, staff costs increased by $668,000, or 16.1%, occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $307,000, or 23.1%, data processing costs (excluding conversion costs) increased by $196,000, or 17.8%, amortization of intangible assets increased by $68,000, or 32.4%, and other operating expenses increased by $141,000, or 13.2%, when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  Not related to the operations of First National, OREO expenses and writedowns increased by $96,000, or 14.4%, in the third quarter of 2016 as higher carrying value writedowns, net of gains on the sale of OREO, during the third quarter of 2016 more than offset lower expenses related to the maintenance of OREO properties in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Income tax expense was $4,803,000 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $5,306,000 for the first nine months of 2015.  The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 35.4% compared to 35.6% for the same period in 2015.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $1,694,000, a 34.9% effective tax rate, compared to $1,865,000 (a 35.9% effective tax rate) for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in income tax expense during the first nine months of 2016 can be primarily attributed to the decrease in pre-tax income detailed above, as the effective tax rate was essentially unchanged.  Similarly, the decrease in income tax expense during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of 2015 can also be primarily attributed to the decrease in pre-tax income for the quarter as detailed above.

B.     Financial Position 

Total assets at September 30, 2016 increased by $253.4 million to $1.498 billion from the $1.245 billion at December 31, 2015.  The increase in total assets since year-end is largely due to the $237.5 million of assets from the Bankshares acquisition in January 2016. Otherwise, a $51.2 million increase in total loans outstanding from organic growth was partially offset by a $36.9 million decrease in securities available for sale.  Earning assets increased by $239.9 million from the $1.147 billion at year-end 2015 to end the quarter at $1.387 billion including an increase of $223.9 million of earning assets from the Bankshares acquisition.

Cash and due from banks at September 30, 2016 was $40.3 million, a $6.4 million increase from the $33.9 million at December 31, 2015.  Interest-bearing bank balances increased by $14.8 million from the $32.8 million reported at December 31, 2015, while federal funds sold increased by $1.0 million to $6.9 million at September 30, 2016.  The increases in cash and due from banks and interest-bearing bank balances are largely due to the Bankshares acquisition, which added approximately $2.4 million of cash and due from banks and $14.0 million of interest bearing bank balances.  Changes in these highly liquid assets are generally in response to increases in deposits, the demand for deposit withdrawals or the funding of loans or investment purchases and are part of Premier s management of its liquidity and interest rate risks.

Securities available for sale totaled $295.2 million at September 30, 2016, a $39.7 million increase from the $255.5 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase was largely due to the $76.6 million of securities available for sale added from the Bankshares acquisition.  Otherwise, securities available for sale have decreased by $36.9 million since year-end, primarily due to proceeds from monthly principal payments on Premier s mortgage backed securities portfolio and securities maturing during the year, which more than offset $22.5 million of investment purchases during the first nine months of 2016 and a $4.5 million increase in the market value of the securities available for sale.  The investment portfolio is predominately high quality residential mortgage backed securities backed by the U.S. Government or Government sponsored agencies.  Any unrealized losses on securities within the portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are believed to be price changes resulting from increases in the long-term interest rate environment since acquiring the investment security and management anticipates receiving all principal and interest on these investments as they come due.  Additional details on investment activities can be found in the  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .

Total loans at September 30, 2016 were $1.034 billion compared to $849.7 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $184.2 million, or 21.7%.  The increase in loans was largely due to the $133.0 million of loans added from the Bankshares acquisition.  Total loans also increased by $51.2 million during the first nine months of 2016, with $41.5 million of the increase occurring during the second quarter of 2016 and another $5.8 millon of the increase occurring during the third quarter of 2016, as internal loan growth at Premier s other operations more than offset regular principal payments, loan payoffs and transfers of loans to OREO upon foreclosure.  Approximately $32.3 million of the net increase in loans during 2016 resulted from an increase in loans originated in Premier s Kentucky and Ohio markets with another $35.0 million of the net increase originated in Premier s Washington DC market.   The remaining $16.1 million net decrease in loans outstanding was primarily in Premier s traditional West Virginia markets.

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

Premises and equipment increased by $4.8 million, as the $5.8 million of premises and equipment of the six branches of First National was partially offset by normal depreciation of fixed assets.  Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $4.0 million, as the $4.9 million of intangible assets generated by the acquisition of Bankshares was partially offset by $862,000 of core deposit intangible amortization.

Deposits totaled $1.274 billion as of September 30, 2016, a $213.4 million, or 20.1%, increase from the $1.060 billion in deposits at December 31, 2015.  The overall increase in deposits is largely due to the initial $205.2 million of deposits assumed in the Bankshares acquisition.  The total of these deposits has decreased by approximately $6.5 million, or 3.2% since acquisition, primarily in certificates of deposit.  Otherwise, total deposits have increased by approximately $14.7 million, or 1.4%, from Premier s other operations.  The $14.7 million increase in deposits includes a $10.6 million, or 3.9%, increase in non-interest bearing deposits, a $7.1 million, or 3.9%, increase in interest bearing transaction accounts, and an $11.3 million, or 4.2%, increase in savings and money market accounts.  These increases more than offset a $14.2 million, or 4.3%, decrease in certificates of deposit as customers continue to retain their maturing certificate of deposit funds in more traditional deposit accounts rather than renew their certificates under the current low interest rate environment.  Repurchase agreements with corporate and public entity customers increased in the first nine months of 2016 by $5.5 million, or 25.1%, which includes $2.2 million obtained by the acquisition of Bankshares.

On January 15, 2016, Premier assumed approximately $1.3 million of amortizing FHLB advances made to First National bearing interest rates ranging from 4.32% to 4.93% and maturities ranging from December 2017 to May 2025.  Through September 30, 2016, Premier has prepaid all but one of these amortizing advances, leaving $490,000 outstanding with a maturity date in December 2024.  For additional details on FHLB advances, see  Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements .

Other borrowed funds decreased by $1.8 million since year-end 2015 due to scheduled principal payments plus additional principal payments on Premier s existing borrowings.  However, Premier also assumed $6.186 million of subordinated debentures issued by Bankshares, reduced by $863,000 of fair value adjustments, as a result of the acquisition of Bankshares in January 2016.  Additional details on the subordinated debentures can be found in  Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements .

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company s nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Total non-performing and restructured loans have increased since year-end, largely due to $360,000 of non-accrual loans and $232,000 of loans past due 90 days or more from the acquisition of Bankshares and $5.6 million of new accruing restructured loans.  Otherwise, non-accrual loans increased by $933,000 and loans past due 90 days or more increased by $3.5 million from Premier s other operations.  Other real estate owned ( OREO ) decreased by $747,000 as new foreclosures in the first nine months of 2016 were exceeded by OREO sales and an additional writedown of the carrying value of one property to a more recent appraised value.  The acquisition of Bankshares did not add any OREO properties.  With limited exception, the non-accrual loans and restructured loans of Bankshares were converted to performing loans as a result of applying purchase discounts to the acquisition value of the loans based upon the borrowers  ability to repay their obligations.  Additional details on these  Purchase Credit Impaired  loans is found in  Note 3 to the financial statements .

Premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non-performing loans by reviewing loan files, using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and/or the foreclosure and sale of OREO properties.  As in the past, when these plans are executed, Premier may experience increases in non-performing loans and non-performing assets.  Furthermore, any resulting increases in loans placed on non-accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income.  Also, as these plans are executed, other loans may be identified that would necessitate additional charge-offs and potentially additional provisions for loan losses.

Gross charge-offs totaled $575,000 during the first nine months of 2016, largely due to consumer lending based charge-offs and the partial charge-off of loans upon foreclosure and placement into OREO.  Any collections on charged-off loans, or partially charged-off loans, would be presented in future financial statements as recoveries of the amounts charged against the allowance.  Recoveries recorded during the first nine months of 2016 totaled $355,000, resulting in net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2016 of $220,000.  This compares to $754,000 of net charge-offs recorded in the first nine months of 2015.  The large amount of net charge-offs in 2015 was largely due to the partial charge-off of previously identified impaired loans upon foreclosure and placement into OREO during the year and the charge-off of the remaining balance over and above the portion guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) on some previously identified impaired loans during the first quarter of 2015.  The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was 1.05% of total loans compared to 1.14% at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in the ratio is largely due to the $133.0 million increase in total loans outstanding resulting from the acquisition of Bankshares with no additional amount added to the allowance.  These loans were recorded at fair value, incorporating estimated credit risk and interest rate yield adjustments into the recorded value.  As such, under current accounting guidance, no increase in the allowance for loan losses was recorded as a result of the Bankshares acquisition.  Excluding the initial $133.0 million in loans from the Bankshares acquisition, the allowance for loan losses would be 1.21% of the remaining loans in the portfolio.  The increase in the comparative ratio since year-end is largely due to an increase in the amount of allowance allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment, plus $500,000 added to the allowance for an estimate of loan losses that may result from the flooding in some of Premier s West Virginia markets during the last week of June, 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

During the first nine months of 2016, Premier recorded a $1,436,000 provision for loan losses.  This provision compares to $232,000 of provision for loan losses recorded during the same nine months of 2015.  The 2016 provision for loan losses was due in large part to the $51.2 million of growth in outstanding loans in 2016, exclusive of the loans acquired from Bankshares, and an estimate for the potential loan losses related to the flash flooding that occurred in some of Premier s West Virginia markets during the last week of June, 2016.  It may be some time before the Company begins to experience any specific loan losses related to unreimbursed damage to borrowers  collateral or any lasting economic impact to business customers in areas that rely on vacation season tourism.  The provision for loan losses for the first nine months of 2015 was impacted by a large loan recovery recorded in the second quarter of 2015.  The recovery exceeded calculated increases in the credit risk of the loan portfolio resulting from increases in specific loan impairments and collectively evaluated loans as a group during the second quarter of 2015.  The result was a $146,000 negative provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2015, which exceeded the $69,000 of provision expense recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and partially offset the $309,000 provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2015.  The total provision for loan losses recorded during the third quarter of 2016 was $312,000 compared to a $309,000 provision for loan losses recorded during the third quarter of 2015.   The impact of the West Virginia flooding on the Company s overall loan portfolio credit quality has been minimal thus far. As a result, management did not believe there was any need to increase its estimate of potential losses as of the end of the third quarter of 2016.  The recorded provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2016 was largely the result of an increase in loans outstanding during the quarter and to provide for the increase in estimated credit risk in loans collectively evaluated for impairment.

The provisions for loan losses recorded in 2015 and 2016 were made in accordance with Premier s policies regarding management s estimation of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These methodologies are subject to change in the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  issued by the FASB in June 2016 which will become effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Future provisions to the allowance for loan losses, positive or negative, will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk.  Premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market prices may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. While some price deterioration has occurred, it is not currently anticipated that Premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the Company s markets in West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. With the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia markets, fluctuations in commercial real estate values will also be monitored. Premier also continues to monitor the impact of the declining coal mining industry that may have a larger impact in the southern area of West Virginia and the state of the natural gas extraction industry which may have a larger impact in the central area of West Virginia.  A declining market and resulting decline in employment could increase non-performing assets.  Premier will continue to monitor and refine its estimate of potential loan losses related to the flash flooding that occurred in some of its West Virginia markets late in the second quarter of 2016.  In each of the last four years, Premier sold some OREO properties at a gain while other OREO properties have required subsequent write-downs to net realizable values. These factors are also considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  For additional details on the activity in the allowance for loan losses, impaired loans, past due and non-accrual loans and restructured loans, see  Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements .

C.    Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  These policies are presented in  Note 1 to the consolidated audited financial statements in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .  Some of these accounting policies, as discussed below, are considered to be critical accounting policies.  Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The Company has identified four accounting policies that are critical accounting policies, and an understanding of these policies is necessary to understand the financial statements.  These policies relate to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the identification and evaluation of impaired loans, the impairment of goodwill and the realization of deferred tax assets.  A detailed description of these accounting policies is contained in the  Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .  There have been no significant changes in the application of these accounting policies since December 31, 2015.

Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

D.    Liquidity 

Liquidity objectives for the Company can be expressed in terms of maintaining sufficient cash flows to meet both existing and unplanned obligations in a cost effective manner.  Adequate liquidity allows the Company to meet the demands of both the borrower and the depositor on a timely basis, as well as pursuing other business opportunities as they arise.  Thus, liquidity management embodies both an asset and liability aspect while attempting to maximize profitability. In order to provide for funds on a current and long-term basis, the Company s subsidiary banks rely primarily on the following sources:

1. 
 Core deposits consisting of both consumer and commercial deposits and certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more.  Management believes that the majority of its $250,000 or more certificates of deposit are no more volatile than its other deposits.  This is due to the nature of the markets in which the subsidiaries operate. 

2. 
 Cash flow generated by repayment of loans and interest. 

3. 
 Arrangements with correspondent banks for purchase of unsecured federal funds. 

4. 
 The sale of securities under repurchase agreements and borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank. 

5. 
 Maintenance of an adequate available-for-sale security portfolio.  The Company owns $295.2 million of securities at fair value as of September 30, 2016. 

The cash flow statements for the periods presented in the financial statements provide an indication of the Company s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.

E.    Capital 

At September 30, 2016, total stockholders  equity of $177.4 million was 11.8% of total assets.  This compares to total stockholders  equity of $147.2 million, or 11.8% of total assets on December 31, 2015.  The increase in stockholders  equity was largely due to the $22.0 million of common stock issued to stockholders of Bankshares in the acquisition.  Otherwise, the $8.8 million of net income in the first nine months of 2016 as well as a $2.9 million, net of tax, increase in the market value of the investment portfolio available for sale were partially offset by $4.3 million, or $0.45 per share, in cash dividends declared and paid to stockholders.

Tier 1 capital totaled $145.5 million at September 30, 2016, which represents a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.9%.  This ratio is up from the 9.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio and $116.3 million of Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015, as the growth in Tier 1 capital from the acquisition of Bankshares was higher in proportion to the average assets added from the acquisition of Bankshares, thus having a positive effect on Premier s leverage ratio.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

The regulatory authorities introduced a new capital measure in the first quarter of 2015 for financial institutions of Premier s size, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  The Common Equity Tier 1 capital measure seeks to determine how much of the traditional Tier 1 capital is attributable to equity contributed by common shareholders by excluding Tier 1 capital from other sources such as preferred stockholders  equity and subordinated debt.  As of September 30, 2016, Premier s Common Equity Tier 1 capital is $6.0 million lower than its total Tier 1 capital due to the additional Tier 1 capital included from the subordinated debentures assumed in the acquisition of Bankshares.  Since the subordinated debentures are held by the parent company, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the subsidiary banks is identical to their total Tier 1 capital, as none of the subsidiary banks have issued any preferred stock or subordinated debentures.  Beginning in 2016, a new 2.50% capital conservation buffer is being phased-in over the next three-years as a component of regulatory capital.  The capital conservation buffer percentage required in 2016 is an additional 0.625% added to the minimum capital ratios, and will be increased by an additional 0.625% each year until fully phased-in in 2019.  By maintaining Premier s regulatory capital ratios in excess of the phased-in capital buffer, the Company will avoid regulatorily imposed limitations on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to management.  Premier s capital conservation buffer over the minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio at September 30, 2016 was 6.73%, compared to the 0.625% required at September 30, 2016 and the 2.50% fully phased-in capital buffer beginning on January 1, 2019.

Book value per common share was $18.36 at September 30, 2016 compared to $18.00 at December 31, 2015.  Adding to Premier s book value per share in the first nine months of 2016 was the $0.92 per share earned during the period partially offset by $0.45 per share in total quarterly cash dividends to common shareholders declared and paid during the first three quarters of 2016.  Also adding to Premier s book value per share at September 30, 2016 was the $2,924,000 of other comprehensive income for the first nine months of 2016 related to the after tax increase in the market value of investment securities available for sale, which increased book value at September 30, 2016 by approximately $0.30 per share.  Partially offsetting these increases in Premier s book value per share in 2016 was the issuance of shares to acquire Bankshares at a fair value less than Premier s $18.00 book value at December 31, 2015.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company currently does not engage in any derivative or hedging activity.  Refer to the  Company s 2015 10-K  for analysis of the interest rate sensitivity.  The Company believes there have been no significant changes in the interest rate sensitivity since previously reported on the  Company s 2015 10-K .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

A.    Disclosure Controls   Procedures 

Premier management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15c as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information required to be filed in this quarterly report has been made known to them in a timely fashion.

B.    Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the first fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Premier's internal controls over financial reporting.

C.    Inherent Limitations on Internal Control 

"Internal controls" are procedures, which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) transactions are properly authorized; (2) assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) transactions are properly recorded and reported, all so as to permit the preparation of reports and financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Finally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
