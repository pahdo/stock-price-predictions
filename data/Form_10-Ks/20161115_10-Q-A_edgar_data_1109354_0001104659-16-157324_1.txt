EXPLANATORY NOTE   

This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (this  Amendment No. 1 ) amends Bruker Corporation s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 (the  Original Filing ). The purpose of this Amendment No.1 is to revise Part I, Item 4 of the Original Filing to reflect management s conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 31, 2016 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified subsequent to the issuance of the Original Filing.  

Other than as described above and the inclusion with this Amendment No. 1 of new certifications by management, and related amendments to the List of Exhibits contained in Part II, Item 6 of the Original Filing, this Amendment No. 1 speaks only as of the date of the Original Filing and does not amend, supplement or update any information contained in the Original Filing to give effect to any subsequent events. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing and our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) subsequent to the Original Filing.

PART I                                                    FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

ITEM 4.                                               CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) by others within our organization to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2016.  At the time that our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 was filed on May 6, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  had concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of March 31, 2016 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Subsequent to that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were  not effective as of March 31, 2016, as the material weakness described below was determined to exist as of March 31, 2016. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

We did not design and maintain effective internal control over the accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. Specifically, management did not design and maintain controls with a level of precision that would identify a material misstatement.  This control deficiency resulted in immaterial errors to deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable and income tax expense accounts in the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 .  These errors did not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material misstatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures for any periods through 

3   

and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. However, this control deficiency could result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, our management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.  

Remediation Plans   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and through the date of this filing, as part of our routine efforts to maintain adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting, we initiated and are implementing measures designed to improve our financial statement closing process and enhance certain internal controls processes and procedures. As indicated below, a number of these initiatives relate directly to strengthening our control over accounting for income taxes and address specific control deficiencies which contributed to the material weakness. As a result of these efforts, as of the date of this filing the Company believes it has made progress toward remediating the underlying causes of the material weakness. Specifically, the Company has undertaken the following steps in 2016 to remediate the deficiencies underlying this material weakness:  

We augmented our tax accounting resources by adding personnel with specific international tax expertise to strengthen tax accounting review procedures in significant jurisdictions; 

We implemented procedures designed to improve the process and timeliness of tax return preparation in significant jurisdictions; 

We developed and implemented enhanced policies and procedures relating to account reconciliations and analysis, including enhancing our documentation to reflect the control attributes that are performed; 

We are implementing close procedures at an interim period to allow for more timely and increased oversight by our management of the calculation and reporting of certain tax balances; 

We identified and implemented technology improvements designed to enhance the functionality of our tax provision software to automate tasks and control workflow; and 

We are reassessing the design of our tax review controls to identify areas where enhanced precision will help detect and prevent material misstatements. 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment, and believe that these remediation efforts represent significant improvements in our control environment. The identified material weakness in internal control will not be considered fully remediated until the internal controls over these areas have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the material weakness has been fully remediated. The Company will continue its efforts to implement and test the new controls in order to make this final determination.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
