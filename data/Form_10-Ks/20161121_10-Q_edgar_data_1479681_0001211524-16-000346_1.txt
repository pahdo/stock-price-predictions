The    underlying    assets    and    liabilities    of    the   discontinued    operations    as    of    September    30,    2016    and    December    31,    2015    are    presented   as follows:      2016     2015    Assets:     Cash   $   --   $   13,893     Accounts receivable, net   51,889   247,372     Prepaid expenses   1,500   1,500         Total assets   $   53,389   $   262,765           6          Liabilities:     Accounts payable and accrued expenses   11,121   117,417     Note payable - related party   4,436   9,936         $   15,557   $   127,353            Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      Principles of Consolidation     The   consolidated   financial   statements   include   the   accounts   of   the   Company   and   its   wholly-   owned     subsidiaries,     Wala,     Inc.     and     Gotham     Innovation     Lab,     Inc.  All     intercompany   accounts and transactions have been eliminated.     Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting   principles   requires management   to   make   estimates   and   assumptions   that   affect   the   reported   amounts    of    assets    and    liabilities    and    disclosure    of    contingent    assets    and    liabilities    at    the   date    of    the    consolidated    financial    statements    and    the    reported    amounts    of    revenues    and   expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments     For    certain    of    the    Company s    financial    instruments,    including    cash,    accounts    receivable,   prepaid    expenses,    accounts    payable,    accrued    interest,    deferred    revenue,    and    amounts    due   to   related parties,   the   carrying   amounts   approximate   fair   value   due   to   their   short   maturities.   Additionally,    there    are    no    assets    or    liabilities    for    which    fair    value    is    remeasured    on    a   recurring basis.     Revenue Recognition     The    Company    recognizes    revenue    from    product    sales    when    the    following    four    revenue   recognition    criteria    are    met:    persuasive    evidence    of    an    arrangement    exists,    an    equipment   order    has    been    placed    with    the    vendor,    the    selling    price    is    fixed    or    determinable,    and   collectability  is  reasonably  assured.    Revenues  from  maintenance  contracts  covering   multiple    future    periods    are    recognized    during    the    current    periods    and    deferred    revenue    is   recorded for future periods and classified as current or noncurrent, depending   on the terms   of the contracts.   Gotham s revenues were   derived primarily   from   the   sale of   products   and services   rendered   to    real    estate    brokers.      Gotham    recognized    revenues    when    the    services    or    products    have   been    provided    or    delivered,    the    fees    charged    are    fixed    or    determinable,    Gotham    and    its   customers    understood    the    specific    nature    and    terms    of    the    agreed    upon    transactions,    and   collectability was reasonably assured.   7            Advertising Costs     The    Company    expenses    advertising    costs    as    incurred.      Advertising    costs    for    the    nine   months    ended    September    30,    2016    and    2015    were    $208,662    and    $3,352,    respectively.   Advertising costs for the    three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $45,079   and $33,333, respectively.     Accounts Receivable     The     Company     analyzes   the     collectability     of     accounts     receivable     from     continuing   operations     each     accounting     period     and     adjusts     its     allowance     for     doubtful     accounts   accordingly.  A   considerable   amount   of   judgment is required   in   assessing   the   realization   of   accounts     receivables,     including     the     creditworthiness     of     each     customer,     current     and   historical    collection    history    and    the    related    aging    of    past    due    balances.     The    Company   evaluates  specific  accounts  when  it  becomes  aware  of  information  indicating  that  a   customer    may    not    be    able    to    meet    its    financial    obligations    due    to    deterioration    of    its   financial condition, lower   credit ratings, bankruptcy   or   other   factors affecting   the ability   to   render payment.  Allowance for doubtful accounts    was $8,345 at September 30, 2016 and   December    31,    2015,    respectively.     There    was    no    bad    debt    expense    charged    to    operations   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     Inventories     Inventories consisting of    finished products    are stated at the lower of cost or market.     Cost   is determined on an average cost basis.     Property and equipment and depreciation     Property   and   equipment are   stated   at cost.    Maintenance   and   repairs   are   charged   to   expense   when    incurred.   When    property    and    equipment    are    retired    or    otherwise    disposed    of,    the   related    cost    and    accumulated    depreciation    are    removed    from    the    respective    accounts    and   any gain   or   loss   is credited   or   charged   to   income.  Depreciation   for   both financial reporting   and     income     tax     purposes     is     computed     using     combinations     of     the     straight     line     and   accelerated methods over the estimated lives of the respective assets as follows:     Office equipment and fixtures   5 - 7 years     Computer hardware   5 years     Computer software   3 years     Development equipment   5 years     Goodwill     Goodwill represents the excess of liabilities assumed over assets acquired of ArcMail and   the    fair    market    value    of the    common    shares    issued    by the    Company for    the    acquisition    of   ArcMail.     In    accordance    with    ASC    Topic    No.    350     Intangibles         Goodwill    and    Other ),   the goodwill is not being amortized, but instead will be subject to an annual assessment of   8          impairment    by    applying    a    fair-value    based    test,    and    will    be    reviewed    more    frequently    if   current    events    and    circumstances    indicate    a    possible    impairment.    An    impairment    loss    is   charged    to    expense    in    the    period    identified.    If    indicators    of    impairment    are    present    and   future cash flows    are not    expected to be    sufficient    to recover the asset s carrying amount,   an   impairment   loss   is   charged   to   expense   in   the   period   identified.   A   lack   of   projected   future   operating results from ArcMail s operations may cause impairment.  As the acquisition of   ArcMail   occurred   on   November   4,   2015,   it   is   too   early   for   management   to   evaluate   whether   goodwill    has    been    impaired.     No    impairment    was    recorded    during the    nine    months    ended   September 30, 2016.     Long-Lived Assets     The    Company    assesses    the    valuation    of    components    of    its    property    and    equipment    and   other    long-lived    assets    whenever    events    or    circumstances    dictate    that    the    carrying    value   might    not    be    recoverable.    The    Company    bases    its    evaluation    on    indicators    such    as    the   nature    of    the    assets,    the    future    economic    benefit    of    the    assets,    any    historical    or    future   profitability    measurements    and    other    external    market    conditions    or    factors    that    may    be   present. If   such   factors indicate   that the   carrying   amount of an asset or   asset group may   not   be   recoverable,   the   Company   determines   whether   an   impairment   has   occurred   by   analyzing   an    estimate    of    undiscounted    future    cash    flows    at    the    lowest    level    for    which    identifiable   cash   flows   exist.   If   the   estimate   of   undiscounted   cash   flows during   the   estimated   useful life   of the asset is    less than the carrying value of the    asset, the Company recognizes a loss for   the   difference   between   the   carrying   value   of   the   asset   and   its   estimated   fair   value,   generally   measured by the present value of the estimated cash flows.     Deferred Revenue     Deposits  from  customers  are  not  recognized  as  revenues,  but  as  liabilities,  until  the   following     conditions     are     met:     revenues     are     realized     when     cash     or     claims     to     cash   (receivable) are   received in exchange   for   goods   or   services   or   when   assets   received   in   such   exchange are readily convertible to cash or claim to cash or when such goods/services are   transferred. When such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and   the   deferred revenue is reduced. To the   extent revenues are generated from   the   Company s   support    and    maintenance    services,    the    Company recognizes    such    revenues    when    services   are    completed    and    billed.    The    Company has    received    deposits    from    its    various    customers   that have been recorded as deferred revenue in the amount of $882,484 and $1,190,279 as   of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     Stock-Based Compensation     The   Company   accounts   for   its   stock-based   awards   granted   under   its   employee   compensation    plan    in    accordance  with    ASC    Topic    No.    718-20,   Awards        Classified        as     Equity,     which    requires    the    measurement    of    compensation    expense    for    all    share-based   compensation    granted    to    employees    and    non-employee    directors    at    fair    value    on    the    date   of    grant    and    recognition  of    compensation    expense    over    the    related    service    period    for   awards    expected    to    vest.  The    Company    uses    the    Black-Scholes    option    pricing    model    to   estimate the fair value of its stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes option pricing   model    requires    the    input    of    highly    subjective    assumptions    including    the    expected    stock   9          price    volatility    of    the    Company s    common    stock,    the    risk    free    interest    rate    at    the    date    of   grant,   the   expected   vesting   term   of   the   grant,   expected   dividends,   and   an   assumption   related   to   forfeitures of   such grants.  Changes   in   these   subjective   input assumptions   can materially   affect the fair value estimate of the Company s stock options and warrants.     Income Taxes     The   Company   accounts   for   income   taxes   using   the   asset   and   liability   method   in   accordance   with    ASC    Topic    No.    740,       Income        Taxes .    Under    this    method,    deferred  tax    assets    and   liabilities   are   determined based   on   differences between financial reporting   and tax bases   of   assets    and    liabilities,    and    are  measured    using    the    enacted    tax  rates    and    laws    that  are   expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.   The    Company    applies    the    provisions    of    ASC    Topic    No.    740    for    the    financial    statement   recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure  of  uncertain  tax  positions  recognized  in  the   Company s   financial   statements .    In   accordance   with   this   provision,   tax   positions   must   meet   a    more-likely-than-not    recognition    threshold    and    measurement    attribute    for    the    financial   statement recognition and measurement of a tax position.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements      FASB ASC 606 ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from contracts with customers:    In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance    on contracts with customers to transfer   goods or   services or contracts for   the transfer of nonfinancial assets,   unless those contracts   are    within    the    scope    of    other    standards    (e.g.,    insurance    contracts    or    lease    contracts).    The   guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue on contracts with customers to depict the   transfer  of  promised     goods     or  services  to  customers     in  an  amount  that  reflects  the   consideration    to    which    the    entity    expects    to    be    entitled    in    exchange    for    those    goods    or   services.    The    guidance    requires    that    an    entity    depict    the    consideration    by    applying    the   following steps:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.   Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 3: Determine the transaction price.   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   The    amendments    in    this    ASU    are    effective    for    annual    reporting    periods    beginning    after   December     15,     2016,     including     interim     periods     within     that     reporting     period.     Early   application   is   not   permitted.   This   amendment   is   to   be   either   retrospectively   adopted   to   each   prior    reporting    period    presented    or    retrospectively    with    the    cumulative    effect    of    initially   applying this ASU recognized at the    date of initial application. Adoption of this    guidance   is  not  expected  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  consolidated  financial   statements.   10           FASB ASC 718 ASU 2014-12   Compensation   Stock Compensation:    In June 2014, the    FASB    issued ASU No. 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation   (Topic   718): Accounting   for   Share-Based Payments When   the   Terms of   an Award Provide   that a    Performance Target Could be Achieved    after the Requisite    Service    Period," ("ASU   2014-12").    The   amendments   in   ASU   2014-12   require   that   a   performance   target   that   affects   vesting  and  that  could  be  achieved  after  the  requisite  service  period  be  treated  as  a   performance    condition.     A    reporting    entity    should    apply existing guidance    in    ASC    Topic   No. 718,    "Compensation    - Stock Compensation"    as    it    relates    to    awards    with performance   conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.  The amendments in ASU 2014-   12  are  effective  for  annual  periods  and  interim  periods  within  those  annual  periods   beginning after December 15, 2015.     Early adoption    is    permitted.     Entities    may apply the   amendments    in    ASU    2014-12    either:    (a)    prospectively    to    all    awards    granted    or    modified   after    the    effective    date;    or    (b)    retrospectively    to    all    awards    with    performance    targets    that   are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual    period presented in the financial   statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The Company   does not anticipate   that the adoption of ASU 2014-12 will have   a material impact on its consolidated financial   statements.    FASB ASC 740 ASU 2015-17 - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes:    In    November    2015,    the    FASB    issued    ASU    No.    2015-17,     Income    Taxes    (Topic    740):   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). The FASB issued this   ASU  as  part  of  its  ongoing  Simplification  Initiative,  with  the  objective  of  reducing   complexity   in   accounting standards.   The   amendments   in   ASU   2015-17   require   entities   that   present    a    classified    balance    sheet    to    classify    all    deferred    tax    liabilities    and    assets    as    a   noncurrent amount.   This   guidance   does   not change   the   offsetting   requirements   for   deferred   tax    liabilities    and    assets,    which    results    in    the    presentation    of    one    amount    on    the    balance   sheet.   Additionally,   the   amendments   in   this   ASU   align   the   deferred   income   tax   presentation   with    the  requirements  in    International  Accounting    Standards  (IAS)    1,    Presentation    of   Financial     Statements.      The     amendments     in     ASU     2015-17     are     effective     for  financial   statements    issued    for    annual    periods    beginning    after    December    15,    2016,    and    interim   periods within those annual periods. The   Company   does not anticipate   that the   adoption of   this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    FASB ASC 842 ASU 2016-02   Leases:    In February   2016,   the FASB   issued   ASU   No.   2016-02,  Leases   (Topic   842)    ( ASU   2016-   02 ).   ASU   2016-02   requires   an   entity   to   recognize   assets   and   liabilities   arising   from   a   lease   for    both    financing    and    operating    leases.    The    ASU    will    also    require    new    qualitative    and   quantitative     disclosures     to     help     investors     and     other     financial     statement     users     better   understand    the    amount,    timing,    and    uncertainty    of    cash    flows    arising    from    leases. ASU   2016-02  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2018,  with  early   adoption permitted. The    Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-02 and its impact on   its consolidated financial statements.   11

Basic   and   diluted   net   earnings (loss)   per   common   share    was    determined    by    dividing net    earnings    (loss)    applicable    to    common    stockholders   by    the    weighted    average    number    of    common    shares    outstanding    during    the    period.    The   Company s    potentially    dilutive    shares,    which    include    outstanding common    stock    options   and    common    stock    warrants,    have    not    been    included    in    the    computation    of    diluted    net   earnings (loss) per share for all periods as the result would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-based compensation expense, which   is    calculated    net    of    estimated    forfeitures,    is    computed    using    the    grant    date    fair-value    and   amortized    over    the    requisite    service    period    for    all    stock    awards    that    are    expected    to    vest.   12        
    The    grant    date    fair    value    for    stock    options    and    warrants    is    calculated    using    the    Black-   Scholes    option    pricing    model.    Determining    the    fair    value    of    options    at    the    grant    date   requires  judgment,  including  estimating  the  expected  term  that  stock  options  will  be   outstanding    prior    to    exercise,    the    associated    volatility    of    the    Company s    common    stock,   expected    dividends,    and    a    risk-free    interest    rate.    Stock-based    compensation    expense    is   reported    under    general    and    administrative    expenses    in    the    accompanying    consolidated   statements of operations.    Options    In     2006,     the     Company     adopted     the     2006   Long-Term   Incentive     Plan     (the     "2006   Plan").      Awards    granted    under    the    2006    Plan    have    a    ten-year    term    and    may    be    incentive   stock    options,    non-qualified  stock    options  or    warrants.  The  awards  are  granted  at  an   exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and generally vest over a   three  or  four  year  period.  The  Plan  expired  on  December  31,  2009,  therefore  as  of   September    30,    2016,    there    was    no    unrecognized    compensation    cost    related    to    non-vested   share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2006 plan.   The 2006 Plan provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of   common  stock.  8,146,900  options  have  been  issued  under  the  plan  to  date  of  which   7,157,038    have    been    exercised    and    692,962    have    expired    to    date.  There    were    296,900   options outstanding under the 2006 Plan on its expiration date of December 31, 2009.   All options issued subsequent to this date were not issued pursuant to any plan and vested   upon issuance.

Principal amounts due on notes payable for the years ended December 31, are as follows:     2016   $   786,624     2017   779,750     2018   779,750     2019   779,751     $       3,125,875       During  the  nine  months  ended     September  30,  2016,  Arcmail  entered  into  merchant   financing    agreements    with    two    lenders    for    proceeds    totaling    $281,000    payable    in    daily   amounts based on various percentages of future    collections of accounts receivable, which   were    assigned    to    the    lenders.

     Note 9   Stock Transactions     Common Stock Issued    In    connection    with    the    acquisition    of    ArcMail    the    Company    issued    11,500,000    common   shares    valued    at    $.10    per    share    to    the    president    and    CEO    of    Wala,    Inc.    on    November    4,   2015.   The    Company    issued    1,000,000    and    600,000    common    shares    for    services,    valued    at    $.20   per share on August 3, 2015 and May 18, 2015, respectively.    Note 10 - Income Taxes     Quarter Ended September 30,       2016     2015      Effective tax rate   0.0 %   0.0 %   A full valuation allowance was recorded against the Company s net deferred tax assets. A   valuation    allowance    must    be    established    if    it    is    more    likely    than    not    that    the    deferred    tax   assets  will  not  be  realized.  This  assessment  is  based  upon  consideration  of  available   positive and negative    evidence, which includes, among other things, the Company s    most   recent    results    of    operations    and    expected    future    profitability.    Based    on    the    Company s   cumulative  losses  in  recent  years,  a  full  valuation  allowance  against  the  Company s   deferred    tax    assets    has    been    established    as    Management    believes    that    the    Company    will   not realize the benefit of those deferred tax assets.    Note 11 - Retirement Plan    ArcMail has a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which covers substantially all employees.   Under  the  terms     of  the  Plan,  Arcmail  is     currently  not  required     to  match  employee   contributions.  The Company did not    make any employer contributions to the Plan during   the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Revenue Recognition     We     recognize     revenue     from     product     sales     when     the     following     four     revenue   recognition    criteria    are    met:    persuasive    evidence    of    an    arrangement    exists,    an    equipment   order    has    been    placed    with    the    vendor,    the    selling    price    is    fixed    or    determinable,    and   collectability  is  reasonably  assured.    Revenues  from  maintenance  contracts  covering   multiple    future    periods    are    recognized    during    the    current    periods    and    deferred    revenue    is   recorded for future periods and classified as current or noncurrent, depending   on the terms   of the contracts.   Gotham s revenues were   derived primarily   from   the   sale of   products   and services   rendered   to    real    estate    brokers.      Gotham    recognized    revenues    when    the    services    or    products    have   been    provided    or    delivered,    the    fees    charged    are    fixed    or    determinable,    Gotham    and    its   customers    understood    the    specific    nature    and    terms    of    the    agreed    upon    transactions,    and   collectability was reasonably assured.   18            Deferred Revenue     Deposits from customers are not recognized as revenues, but as liabilities, until the   following     conditions     are     met:     revenues     are     realized     when     cash     or     claims     to     cash   (receivable) are   received in exchange   for   goods   or   services   or   when   assets   received   in   such   exchange are readily convertible to cash or claim to cash or when such goods/services are   transferred. When such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and   the   deferred   revenue   is   reduced.   To   the   extent   revenues   are   generated   from   our   support and   maintenance   services,   we   recognize   such   revenues   when   services   are   completed   and   billed.   We    received    deposits    from    our    various    customers    that    have    been    recorded    as    deferred   revenue  in  the  amount  of  $882,484  and     $1,190,279  as  of  September  30,  2016  and   December 31, 2015, respectively     Accounts Receivable     We    analyze    the    collectability    of    accounts    receivable    from    continuing    operations   each    accounting    period    and    adjust    our    allowance    for    doubtful    accounts    accordingly.    A   considerable  amount  of  judgment  is  required  in  assessing    the  realization  of  accounts   receivables,  including  the    creditworthiness  of  each  customer,  current  and  historical   collection   history   and   the   related   aging   of   past   due   balances. We   evaluate   specific   accounts   when we become aware of information indicating that a customer may not be able to meet   its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition, lower credit ratings,   bankruptcy   or   other   factors affecting   the   ability   to render   payment.   Allowance   for   doubtful   accounts was $8,345 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     There   was    no    bad    debt    expense    charged    to    operations    for    the    nine    months    ended    September 30,   2016 and 2015, respectively.     Property and Equipment     Property and    equipment    are stated at    cost. Maintenance    and repairs    are    charged to   expense    when    incurred.     When    property    and    equipment    are    retired    or    otherwise    disposed   of,   the   related   cost   and   accumulated   depreciation   are   removed   from   the   respective   accounts   and    any    gain    or    loss    is    credited    or    charged    to    income.   Depreciation    for    both    financial   reporting   and income   tax purposes is computed using   combinations of the   straight line and   accelerated methods over the estimated lives of the respective assets as follows:     Office equipment and fixtures   5 - 7 years     Computer hardware   5 years     Computer software   3 years     Development equipment   5 years   Depreciation    expense    of $17,196    and    $496    was    charged    to    operations    for    the    nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   19            Goodwill     Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  liabilities  assumed  over  assets  acquired  of   ArcMail    and    the    fair    market    value    of    the    common    shares    issued    by    the    Company    for    the   acquisition    of    ArcMail.     In    accordance    with    ASC    Topic No.    350     Intangibles         Goodwill   and Other ),    the    goodwill    is    not    being amortized,    but    instead    will    be    subject    to an    annual   assessment    of    impairment    by applying    a    fair-value    based    test,    and    will    be    reviewed    more   frequently     if     current     events     and     circumstances     indicate     a     possible     impairment.     An   impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. If indicators of impairment   are    present    and    future    cash    flows    are    not    expected    to    be    sufficient    to    recover    the    asset s   carrying amount, an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified. A lack   of   projected   future   operating   results   from   ArcMail s   operations may   cause   impairment.    As   the acquisition of ArcMail occurred on November 4, 2015, it is too early for management   to evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired.     No impairment was recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016.     Stock-Based Compensation     Stock-based    compensation    expense    for    all    stock-based    award    programs, including   grants   of   stock   options   and   warrants,   is   recorded   in   accordance   with   " Compensation Stock     Compensation ", Topic 718 of the    FASB ASC. Stock-based compensation expense, which   is    calculated    net    of    estimated    forfeitures,    is    computed    using    the    grant    date    fair-value    and   amortized    over    the    requisite    service    period    for    all    stock    awards    that    are    expected    to    vest.   The    grant    date    fair    value    for    stock    options    and    warrants    is    calculated    using    the    Black-   Scholes    option    pricing    model.    Determining    the    fair    value    of    options    at    the    grant    date   requires  judgment,  including  estimating  the  expected  term  that  stock  options  will  be   outstanding    prior    to    exercise,    the    associated    volatility    of    the    Company s    common    stock,   expected    dividends,    and    a    risk-free    interest    rate.    Stock-based    compensation    expense    is   reported    under    general    and    administrative    expenses    in    the    accompanying    consolidated   statements of operations.     Options     In      2006,      we      adopted      the      2006      Long-Term      Incentive      Plan      (the      "2006   Plan").      Awards    granted    under    the    2006    Plan    have    a    ten-year    term    and    may    be    incentive   stock    options,    non-qualified  stock    options  or    warrants.  The  awards  are  granted  at  an   exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and generally vest over a   three   or   four year   period. The   Plan expired on December   31,   2009, therefore as of June   30,   2016,    there    was    no    unrecognized    compensation    cost    related    to    non-vested    share-based   compensation arrangements granted under the 2006 plan.   The    2006    Plan    provided    for    the    granting    of    options    to    purchase    up    to    10,000,000   shares    of    common    stock.  8,146,900    options    have    been    issued    under    the    plan    to    date    of   which    7,157,038    have    been    exercised  and  692,962  have  expired    to    date.  There    were   296,900    options    outstanding    under    the    2006    Plan    on    its    expiration    date    of    December    31,   2009.   20

Income Taxes     We    account    for    income    taxes    using    the    asset    and    liability    method    in    accordance   with    ASC    Topic    No.    740,       Income        Taxes .    Under    this    method,    deferred  tax    assets    and   liabilities   are   determined based   on   differences between financial reporting   and tax bases   of   assets    and    liabilities,    and    are  measured    using    the    enacted    tax  rates    and    laws    that  are   expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.   We  apply  the  provisions     of  ASC  Topic  No.  740  for  the  financial  statement   recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure  of  uncertain  tax  positions  recognized  in  the   Company s   financial   statements .    In   accordance   with   this   provision,   tax   positions   must   meet   a    more-likely-than-not    recognition    threshold    and    measurement    attribute    for    the    financial   statement   recognition   and   measurement   of   a   tax   position.   Management   has determined   that   the     Company     has     no     significant     uncertain     tax     positions     requiring     recognition     and   measurement under ASC 740-10.    MANAGEMENT S       DISCUSSION       AND       ANALYSIS       OF       FINANCIAL       CONDITION     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     INTRODUCTION    iGambit    is    a    company    focused    on    the    technology    markets.    Our    sole    operating   subsidiary, Wala, Inc. doing business as ArcMail Technology (ArcMail) is in the business   of providing simple, secure    and    cost-effective    e nterprise      information      and      email      archiving    solutions    for businesses    of all    sizes    across a    range of vertical    markets.     We      are      focused on    expanding the    operations    of ArcMail    by marketing the    company to    existing    and    potential   new clients.     Assets.      At    September    30,    2016,    we    had    $7,495,555    in    total    assets,    compared    to   $7,637,996    at    December    31,    2015.    The    decrease    in    total    assets    was    primarily    due    to    the   decrease  in  cash,  the  decrease  in  prepaid  expenses,  and  the  decrease  in  assets  from   discontinued operations.     Liabilities.   At September 30, 2016, our total liabilities were $6,052,495 compared   to  $6,076,680  at  December  31,  2015.  Our  current  liabilities  at  September  30,  2016   consisted of accounts payable   and accrued expenses   of   $745,725,   accrued   interest on   notes   payable  of     $494,207       amounts     due  to     related     parties     of     $82,923,     notes     payable     of   $1,022,649,  liabilities  from  discontinued  operations  of  $15,557  and  deferred  revenue   current  portion  of  $385,396,  whereas  our  current  liabilities  as  of  December 31,  2015   consisted   of    accounts   payable   and   accrued   expenses   of   $636,633,   accrued   interest   on   notes   payable   of   $302,278,   notes   payable   of   $936,316,   amounts   due   to   related   parties   of   $74,871,   liabilities    from discontinued    operations    of $127,353 and    deferred    revenue    current    portion   of   $811,227. Our   long   term   liabilities at September 30,   2016 consisted of Notes payable   of   23          $2,808,950 and deferred    revenue non-current    portion of $497,088, whereas    our long term   liabilities as of December 31, 2015 consisted of Notes payable of $2,808,950 and deferred   revenue non-current portion of $379,052.     Stockholders              Equity.       Our     stockholders      equity     decreased     to     $1,443,060     at   September   30, 2016 from $1,561,316 at December 31, 2015.  This decrease was a   result of   a net loss of $(118,256) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    THREE        MONTHS        ENDED        SEPTEMBER        30,        2016        AS        COMPARED        TO        THREE     MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015      Revenues             and             Net             Loss   .        We     had     $797,817     of     revenue     from     our     ArcMail   subsidiary   and   net   income   of   $216,666   during   the   three   months   ended   September   30,   2016,   compared to revenue of $0 and net    loss of $74,849 for the three months    ended September   30,    2015.     The    increase    in    revenue    was    due    primarily to    an    increase    in    revenue    generated   by     our     ArcMail     subsidiary     acquired     in     November     2015.     In     addition     to     ArcMail s   operations,   we   had   income   from   discontinued   operations   of   $550   compared   to   income   from   discontinued    operations    of    $47,619    for    the    three    months    ended    September    30,    2016    and   September 30, 2015, respectively.     General  and  Administrative  Expenses   .   General  and  Administrative  Expenses   increased    to $458,686    for    the    three    months    ended    September 30,    2016    from $121,833    for   the    three    months    ended    September    30,    2015.    For    the    three    months    ended    September    30,   2016  our  General  and  Administrative  Expenses  consisted  of  corporate  administrative   expenses    of    $66,705,    legal    and    accounting    fees    of    $22,307,    health    insurance    expenses    of   $18,992,    general    business    insurance    expense    of    $8,142,    payroll    expenses    of    $288,457,   marketing    expense    of    $45,079,    computer    and    internet    expense    of    $6,748,    and    exchange   filing    fees    of    $2,256.     For    the    three    months    ended    September    30,    2015    our    General    and   Administrative Expenses consisted of corporate administrative expenses of $29,778, legal   and    accounting    fees    of    $16,222,    finder s    fees    and    commissions    of    $17,500,    marketing   expense    of    $33,333,    and    investor    relations    expenses    of    $25,000.    The    increases    from    the   three    months    ended    September    30,    2015    to    the    three    months    ended    September    30,    2016   relate  primarily  to:  (i) an  increase  in  payroll  expenses;  (ii) an  increase  in  consulting   expenses;    (iii)    an    increase    in    exchange    filing    fees;    and    (iv)    an    increase    in    general    and   administrative    costs    associated    with    the    operation    of    our    ArcMail    subsidiary    acquired    in   November    2015.    Costs    associated    with    our    officers     salaries    and    the    operation    of    our   ArcMail subsidiary should remain level    going forward, subject    to a    material    expansion in   the   business   operations   of   ArcMail   which   would   likely   increase   our   corporate   administrative expenses.     Other Income (Expense) and Taxes   .  We had interest expense of $115,348 for the   three    months    ended    September    30,    2016    compared    to    $635    for    the    three    months    ended   September 30, 2015.   24           Nine         Months         Ended         September         30,         2016         as         Compared         to         Six         Months         Ended     September 30, 2015      Revenues and Net Loss   .      We    had $1,791,518 of revenue    and net    loss of $118,256   during   the nine   months ended September 30, 2016,   compared to revenue of $0 and net loss   of $271,392    for the    nine    months    ended September    30, 2015. The    increase    in    revenue    was   due    primarily    to    an    increase    in    revenue    generated    by    our    ArcMail    subsidiary    acquired    in   November    2015.    In    addition    to    ArcMail s    operations,    we    had    income    from    discontinued   operations    of    $3,868    and    $79,584    for    the    nine    months    ended    September    30,    2016    and   September 30, 2015, respectively.     General  and  Administrative  Expenses   .   General  and  Administrative  Expenses   increased to $1,598,461 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $348,840 for   the   nine   months   ended   September   30,   2015.   For   the   nine   months   ended   September   30,   2016   our    General    and    Administrative    Expenses    consisted    of    corporate    administrative    expenses   of    $198,233    legal    and    accounting fees    of    $83,562,    health    insurance    expenses    of    $56,438,   directors   and   officers   insurance   expense   of   $10,053,   general business   insurance   expense   of   $19,797     payroll     expenses     of     $953,386,     finders     fees     and     commissions     of     $26,250,   marketing expense    of $208,662,    computer and    internet    expense    of $31,246    and    exchange   filing    fees    of    $10,834.     For    the    nine    months    ended    September    30,    2015    our    General    and   Administrative Expenses consisted of corporate administrative expenses of $69,185, legal   and    accounting    fees    of    $80,870,    director s    and    officers     insurance    expense    of    $27,249,   general   business   insurance   expense   of   $4,496,   consulting   fees   of   $14,498,   finder s   fees   and   commissions    of    $35,000,    marketing    expense    of    $33,333,    investor    relations    expenses    of   $34,649,    filing fees    of    $10,993,    and    payroll    expenses    of    $38,567.    The    increases    from    the   nine    months    ended    September    30,    2015    to    the    nine    months    ended    September    30,    2016   relate  primarily  to:  (i) an  increase  in  payroll  expenses;  (ii) an  increase  in  consulting   expenses;    (iii)    an    increase    in    exchange    filing    fees;    and    (iv)    an    increase    in    general    and   administrative    costs    associated    with    the    operation    of    our    ArcMail    subsidiary    acquired    in   November    2915.    Costs    associated    with    our    officers     salaries    and    the    operation    of    our   ArcMail subsidiary should remain level    going forward, subject    to a    material    expansion in   the   business   operations   of   ArcMail   which   would   likely   increase   our   corporate   administrative expenses.     Other Income (Expense) and Taxes   .  We had interest expense of $279,060 for the   nine    months    ended    September    30,    2016    compared    to    $2,136    for    the    nine    months    ended   September 30, 2015.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    As    reflected    in the    accompanying    consolidated    financial    statements,    at    September   30, 2016, we had $21,829 of cash and stockholders  equity of $1,443,060    as compared to   $131,987 and $1,561,316, respectively at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 we   had $7,495,555 in total assets, compared to $7,637,996 at December 31, 2015.   25          Our primary capital requirements in 2016 are likely to arise from the expansion of   our   Arcmail   operations,   and,   in   the   event   we   effectuate   an acquisition,   from:   (i) the   amount   of    the    purchase    price    payable    in    cash    at    closing,    if    any;    (ii) professional    fees    associated   with   the   negotiation,   structuring,   and closing   of   the   transaction;   and   (iii) post   closing   costs.   It    is    not    possible    to    quantify    those    costs    at    this    point    in    time,    in    that    they    depend    on   Arcmail s business opportunities, the state of the overall economy, the relative size of any   target    company    we    identify    and    the    complexity    of    the    related    acquisition    transaction(s).   We    anticipate    raising    capital    in    the    private    markets    to    cover    any such    costs,    though    there   can be no guaranty   we will be able to do so on terms we deem to be acceptable. We do not   have    any plans    at    this    point    in    time    to    obtain    a    line    of    credit    or    other    loan    facility    from    a   commercial bank.   While   we   believe   in   the   viability   of   our   strategy   to improve   Arcmail s   sales   volume   and    to    acquire    companies,    and    in    our    ability    to    raise    additional    funds,    there    can    be    no   assurances that we will be able to fully effectuate our business plan.     Cash Flow Activity     Net cash used in continuing operating activities was $304,796 for the nine months   ended    September    30,    2016,    compared    to    $171,912    for    the    nine    months    ended    September   30, 2015. Our primary source of operating cash flows from continuing operating activities   for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2016  was  from  our  ArcMail  subsidiary s   revenues    of    $1,791,518.      Additional    contributing    factors  to    the  change    were    from    an   increase  in  accounts  receivable  of  $315,691,  a  decrease  in  inventories  of  $20,000,  a   decrease    in    prepaid    expenses    of    $102,597,    an    increase    in    accounts    payable    and    accrued   expenses    of    $109,092,    an    increase    in    accrued    interest    of    $191,929,    and    a    decrease    in   deferred revenue of $307,795.  Net cash provided by   discontinued operating activities was   $106,947 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $23,920 for the nine months   ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by   discontinued operations for the nine months   ended   September   30,   2016   and   September   30,   2015,   respectively,   represents   cash   payments   received from VHT which was offset by a decrease in accounts receivable included in the   Assets from Discontinued Operations.   Cash    used    in    continuing    investing    activities    was    $1,194    for    the    nine    months    ended   September    30,    2016    and    cash    used    in    discontinued    investing    activities    of    $5,026    for    the   nine months ended September 30, 2015 was from the purchase of property and equipment   Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was     $88,885  for  the  nine     months  ended   September 30, 2016 compared to $38,336 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The    cash    provided    by    financing    activities    for    the    nine    months    ended    September    30,    2016   consisted of a    net    increase in notes payable of $86,333 and amounts due to related parties   of    $8,052    whereas    the    cash    provided    by    financing    activities    for    the    nine    months    ended   September 30, 2015 consisted of proceeds from loans from shareholders of $38,336.   26            Supplemental Cash Flow Activity     In   the   nine   months ended   September   30,   2016   the   company   paid   interest   of   $13,427   compared to interest of $7,147 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    Item 3.     Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.     Not Required.    Item 4.     Controls  and Procedures.       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     Our    management,    with    the    participation    of    our    chief    executive    officer    and    chief   financial    officer,    evaluated    the    effectiveness    of    our    disclosure    controls    and    procedures   pursuant   to   Rule   13a-15   under   the   Securities   Exchange   Act   of   1934,   as   amended   (Exchange   Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   Based    on    this    evaluation,    our    chief    executive    officer    and    chief    financial    officer   concluded    that,    as    of    September      30,    2016,    our    disclosure    controls    and    procedures    are   designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance   that    information    we    are    required    to    disclose    in    reports    that    we    file    or    submit    under    the   Exchange    Act    is    recorded,    processed,    summarized,    and    reported    within    the    time    periods   specified    in    the    SEC s    rules    and    forms,    and    that    such    information    is    accumulated    and   communicated   to   our   management,   including   our   chief   executive   officer   and   chief   financial   officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     There   were   no   changes   in   our   internal   control   over   financial   reporting   that   occurred   during     the     quarter     ended     September     30,     2016     that     have     materially     affected,     or     are   reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures     In    designing    and    evaluating    the    disclosure    controls    and    procedures,    management   recognizes    that    any    controls    and    procedures,    no    matter    how    well    designed    and    operated,   can    provide    only    reasonable    assurance    of    achieving    the    desired  control    objectives.    In   addition,    the    design    of    disclosure    controls    and    procedures    must    reflect    the    fact    that    there   are     resource     constraints     and     that     management     is     required     to     apply     its     judgment     in   evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.   27           PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1.             Legal  Proceedings.     From    time-to-time,    the    Company is    involved    in    various    civil    actions    as    part    of its    normal   course   of business.   The Company   is not a party   to any   litigation that is material to ongoing   operations as defined in Item 103 of Regulation S-K as of the period ended September 30,   2016.
