Note 1     Significant Reporting and Accounting Policies 
  Nature of Operations 
  We are a holding company that provides insurance through our subsidiaries for personal automobiles with a concentration on nonstandard risks, commercial vehicles and classic collectors. Although licensed to write insurance in all   50   states and the District of Columbia, we focus on select states that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for premium growth and profitability.  
  Basis of Consolidation and Reporting 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K) for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, focuses on our financial performance since the beginning of the year. 
  These financial statements reflect certain adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations and financial position. Such adjustments consist of normal, recurring accruals recorded to accurately match expenses with their related revenue streams and the elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and balances. 
  We have evaluated events that occurred after   September 30, 2016  , for recognition or disclosure in our financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. 
  Schedules may not foot due to rounding. 
  Estimates 
  We based certain accounts and balances within these financial statements upon our estimates and assumptions. The amount of reserves for claims not yet paid, for example, is an item that we can only record by estimation. Unrealized capital gains and losses on investments are subject to market fluctuations, and we use judgment in the determination of whether unrealized losses on certain securities are temporary or other-than-temporary. Should actual results differ significantly from these estimates, the effect on our results of operations could be material. The results of operations for the periods presented may not be indicative of our results for the entire year. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In April 2015 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of January 1, 2016.

  Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The following table illustrates the effect of adopting this standard on the Consolidated Balance Sheets ($ in millions): 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In October 2016 the FASB issued an ASU related to the recognition of income tax on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The guidance requires the income tax to be recognized when the transfer occurs rather than when the asset is sold to an outside party. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within the year of adoption, and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  In June 2016 the FASB issued an ASU related to the accounting for credit losses. The guidance generally requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized as an allowance rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost of a security. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within the year of adoption, with prospective application of the ASU required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized before the implementation date. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  In March 2016 the FASB issued an ASU related to the accounting for employee share-based payments. The guidance addresses the recognition, presentation and classification of awards, forfeitures and shares withheld for tax purposes. The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with each provision having a different application method. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  In February 2016 the FASB issued an ASU related to the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and is to be applied retrospectively, with an option to use a modified retrospective approach for leases which commenced prior to the effective date of this ASU.  We are still evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016 the FASB issued an ASU amending the guidance on classifying and measuring financial instruments. The guidance requires equity securities to be measured at fair value and changes in that fair value to be recognized through net income. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We currently record equity securities at fair value and as of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $10.2 million   net unrealized   gains  , net of tax, recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. 
  In May 2015 the FASB issued an ASU related to the disclosure for short-duration contracts. The guidance requires additional disclosures related to the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses in an effort to increase transparency and comparability. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods after December 15, 2016. The new guidance, which is to be applied retrospectively, will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
  In May 2014 the FASB issued an ASU related to the accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. Insurance contracts have been excluded from the scope of the guidance. In August 2015 the FASB issued an ASU to defer the effective date from fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Note 3     Fair Value 
  Fair values of instruments are based on: 
           (i) 
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1); 
              (ii) 
    quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets (Level 2); or 
              (iii) 
    valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace (Level 3). 
     The following tables present, for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, our assets and liabilities for which we report fair value on a recurring basis ($ in thousands):

We do not report our long-term debt at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The   $292.1 million   and   $281.6 million   fair value of our long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, would be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy if it were reported at fair value. 
  Level 1 includes cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury securities, an exchange-traded fund and equities held in a rabbi trust which funds our Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP). Level 2 includes securities whose fair value was determined using observable market inputs. Level 3 securities are comprised of (i) securities for which there is no active or inactive market for similar instruments; (ii) securities whose fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs; and (iii) securities, other than those backed by the U.S. Government, that are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). We recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of the reporting period. 
  A third party nationally recognized pricing service provides the fair value of securities in Level 2. A summary of the significant valuation techniques and market inputs for each class of security follows: 
  U.S. Government  : In determining the fair value for U.S. Government securities we use the market approach. The primary inputs to the valuation include reported trades, dealer quotes for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, benchmark yields, credit spreads, reference data and industry and economic events. 
  State and municipal  : In determining the fair value for state and municipal securities we use the market approach. The primary inputs to the valuation include reported trades, dealer quotes for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, benchmark yields, credit spreads, reference data and industry and economic events. 
  Mortgage-backed securities  : In determining the fair value for mortgage-backed securities we use the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach. The primary inputs to the valuation include reported trades, dealer quotes for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, benchmark yields, credit spreads, reference data, industry and economic events and monthly payment information. 
  Asset-backed securities  : In determining the fair value for asset-backed securities we use the market approach and to a lesser extent the income approach. The primary inputs to the valuation include reported trades, dealer quotes for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, benchmark yields, credit spreads, reference data, industry and economic events, monthly payment information and collateral performance. 
  Corporate  : In determining the fair value for corporate securities we use the market approach. The primary inputs to the valuation include reported trades, dealer quotes for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, benchmark yields, credit spreads (for investment grade securities), observations of equity and credit default swap curves (for high-yield corporates), reference data and industry and economic events. 
  We review the third party pricing methodologies quarterly and test for significant differences between the market price used to value the security and recent sales activity.

Of the   $2.1 million   fair value of securities in Level 3 at   September 30, 2016  , which consisted of   five   securities, we priced   three   based on non-binding broker quotes,   one     price was   provided by our unaffiliated money manager, and   one     security, which was included in Level 3 because it was not rated by a NRSRO, was priced by a nationally recognized pricing service.    
  One   security was transferred from Level 2 into Level 3 during the first quarter of 2016 because a price could not be determined using observable market inputs. However, during the third quarter of 2016, a price was obtained using observable market inputs and the security was transferred back into Level 2.   One   security was transferred from Level 2 into Level 3 during the second quarter of 2016 following an exchange after which it was no longer rated by a NRSRO. There were no transfers of securities between Levels 1 and 2 in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  The gains or losses included in net earnings are included in the line item "Net realized gains (losses) on investments" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We recognize the net gains or losses included in other comprehensive income in the line item "  Unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net  " in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the line item "Change in unrealized gain on investments" or the line item "Change in non-credit component of impairment losses on fixed maturities" in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders  Equity.

  Note 4     Investments 
  We consider all fixed maturity and equity securities to be available-for-sale and report them at fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported after-tax (net of any valuation allowance) as a component of other comprehensive income. The proceeds from sales of securities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $68.0 million   and   $276.8 million  , respectively, while the proceeds from sales of securities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , were   $75.9 million   and   $232.6 million  , respectively. The proceeds for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were net of   $1.7 million   of receivable for unsettled sales as of   September 30, 2016  . The proceeds for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , were net of   $2.7 million   of receivable for securities sold during the   third   quarter of   2015   that had not settled as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  Gross gains of   $1.3 million   and gross losses of   $42.0 thousand   were realized on sales of available-for-sale securities during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with gross gains of   $1.6 million   and gross losses of   $1.9 million   realized on sales during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Gross gains of   $3.5 million   and gross losses of   $1.9 million   were realized on sales of available-for-sale securities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with gross gains of   $4.3 million   and gross losses of   $2.6 million   realized on sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Gains or losses on securities are determined on a specific identification basis.

The determination of whether unrealized losses are  other-than-temporary  requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors. Factors we considered and resources we used in our determination include: 
             
    whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates; 
                
    the length of time the security s market value has been below its cost; 
                
    the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis; 
                
    the intent to sell the security; 
                
    whether it is more likely than not that there will be a requirement to sell the security before its anticipated recovery; 
                
    historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings;

     We regularly evaluate for potential impairment each security position that has either of the following: a fair value of less than   95%   of its book value or an unrealized loss that equals or exceeds $  100,000  . 
  The following table summarizes those securities, excluding the rabbi trust, with unrealized gains or losses:

The change in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities included the following ($ in thousands): 

For fixed maturity securities that are other-than-temporarily impaired, we assess our intent to sell and the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost. If a fixed maturity security is considered other-than-temporarily impaired but we do not intend to and are not more than likely to be required to sell the security before our recovery of amortized cost, we separate the amount of the impairment into a credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors ("non-credit component"). The excess of the amortized cost over the present value of the expected cash flows determines the credit loss component of an impairment charge on a fixed maturity security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of cash flows discounted at (i) the effective interest rate implicit at the date of acquisition for non-structured securities; or (ii) the book yield for structured securities. The techniques and assumptions for determining the best estimate of cash flows vary depending on the type of security. We recognize the credit loss component of an impairment charge in net earnings and the non-credit component in accumulated other comprehensive income. If we intend to sell or will, more likely than not, be required to sell a security, we treat the entire amount of the impairment as a credit loss. 
  For our securities held with unrealized losses, we believe, based on our analysis, we will recover our cost basis in these securities and we do not intend to sell the securities nor is it more likely than not there will be a requirement to sell the securities before they recover in value. 
  The following table is a progression of credit losses on fixed maturity securities that were bifurcated between a credit and non-credit component ($ in thousands):

The table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016  , based on their fair values ($ in thousands). We report securities that do not have a single maturity date at average maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers. 

Note 5     Long-Term Debt 

In September 2012 we issued   $275 million   principal of senior notes due September 2022 (the    5.0%   Senior Notes ). The   5.0%   Senior Notes accrue interest at   5.0%  , payable semiannually. At the time we issued the   5.0%   Senior Notes, we capitalized   $2.2 million   of debt issuance costs, which we are amortizing over the term of the   5.0%   Senior Notes. We calculated the   September 30, 2016  , fair value of   $292.1 million   using a   223   basis point spread to the   10  -year U.S. Treasury Note of   1.596%  . 
  In August 2014 we renewed our agreement for a   $50 million     three  -year revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) that requires us to meet certain financial and other covenants. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement, and as of   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings outstanding against it.

  We made the following payments that we do not separately disclose in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows ($ in thousands): 

Negative Cash Book Balances 
  Negative cash book balances, included in the line item  Other liabilities  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were   $40.8 million   and   $41.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
   
  Note 8     Insurance Reserves 
  Insurance reserves include liabilities for unpaid losses, both known and estimated for incurred but not reported (IBNR), and unpaid loss adjustment expenses (LAE).

The   $0.6 million   and   $18.6 million   of   favorable   reserve development during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, was primarily due to   decreases in severity estimates related to Florida personal injury protection and bodily injury coverages related to accident years 2015 and prior, partially offset by unfavorable development from accident year 2015 in California material damage coverages and in bodily injury coverages in our commercial vehicle product, driven by an increase in severity. 
  The   $24.0 million   of   favorable   reserve development during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   was primarily due to decreases in severity as well as decreases in loss adjustment expenses related to Florida bodily injury coverages in accident years 2013 and 2014. A decrease in loss adjustment expenses related to California bodily injury coverages in accident years 2013 and 2014 also contributed to the     $11.3 million   of   favorable   reserve development during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Note 9     Commitments and Contingencies 
  Commitments 
  We extended our building lease in Alpharetta, Georgia through   November 30, 2021  , at a total base rent amount over the lease period of   $2.7 million  . In addition, a significant portion of our fleet vehicles, which have minimum lease terms of   367   days, were traded in during the first six months of 2016. The minimum remaining lease payment on our fleet as of   September 30, 2016  , is   $0.9 million  . Other than these items, there have been no material changes from the commitments discussed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . For a description of our previously reported commitments, refer to   Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies   of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Contingencies 
  From time to time we and our subsidiaries are named as defendants in various lawsuits incidental to our insurance operations. We consider legal actions relating to claims made in the ordinary course of seeking indemnification for a loss covered by the insurance policy in establishing loss and LAE reserves. 
  We also face, in the ordinary course of business, lawsuits that seek damages beyond policy limits, commonly known as extra-contractual claims, as well as class action and individual lawsuits that involve issues not unlike those facing other insurance companies and employers. We continually evaluate potential liabilities and reserves for litigation of these types using the criteria established by the Contingencies topic of the FASC. Under this guidance we may only record reserves for a loss if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount. If a material loss is judged to be reasonably possible, we will disclose an estimated range of loss or state that an estimate cannot be made. We consider each legal action using this guidance and record reserves for losses as warranted by establishing a reserve captured within our Consolidated Balance Sheets line-items  Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  for extra-contractual claims and  Other liabilities  for class action and other non-claims related lawsuits. We record amounts incurred on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings within  Losses and loss adjustment expenses  for extra-contractual claims and  Other expenses  for class action and other non-claims related lawsuits. 
  Certain claims and legal actions have been brought against us for which we have accrued no loss, and for which an estimate of a possible range of loss cannot be made under the above rules. While it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims or lawsuits, we do not believe they are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or liquidity. However, losses incurred because of these cases could have a material adverse impact on net earnings in a given period. 
  For a description of previously reported contingencies, refer to   Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies   of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

ITEM 2 
  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  which anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. We make these statements subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements in this report not dealing with historical results or current facts are forward-looking and we base them on estimates, assumptions and projections. Statements which include the words  assumes,   believes,   seeks,   expects,   may,   should,   intends,   likely,   targets,   plans,   anticipates,   estimates  or the negative version of those words and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements. Examples of such forward-looking statements include statements relating to expectations concerning market conditions, premium growth, earnings, investment performance, expected losses, rate changes and loss experience. 
  The primary events or circumstances that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect include determinations with respect to reserve adequacy, realized gains or losses on the investment portfolio (including other-than-temporary impairments for credit losses), loss cost trends, and competitive conditions in our key Focus States (defined in    Results of Operations   Underwriting   Premium   ). We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of some of the foregoing risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements refer to   Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
   
  OVERVIEW 
  Higher average premiums in California, growth in Texas and renewal business growth in our commercial vehicle product resulted in gross written premium   growth   of   7.5%   during the   third   quarter of   2016  . However, our gross written premium has   declined     0.5%   during the first nine months of   2016   as lower premium during the first half of the year more than offset the growth during the third quarter.   Refer to   Results of Operations   Underwriting   Premium   for a more detailed discussion of our gross written premium. 
  Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $2.8 million   and   $0.25  , respectively, compared with   $15.7 million   and   $1.38  , respectively, for the same periods of   2015  . Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $21.5 million   and   $1.93  , respectively, compared with   $40.4 million   and   $3.52  , respectively, for the same periods of   2015  . The   decrease   in net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   primarily due to an increase in the accident year combined ratio from 97.6% at September 30, 2015, to 99.8% at September 30, 2016, and a decrease in favorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves.    
  Included in net earnings for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $0.4 million   (  $0.6 million   pre-tax) and   $12.1 million   (  $18.6 million   pre-tax), respectively, of   favorable   development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. This development was primarily due to   decreases in severity estimates related to Florida personal injury protection and bodily injury coverages related to accident years 2015 and prior, partially offset by unfavorable development from accident year 2015 in California material damage coverages and in bodily injury coverages in our commercial vehicle product, driven by an increase in severity.   Included in net earnings for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was   $7.4 million   (  $11.3 million   pre-tax) and   $15.6 million   (  $24.0 million   pre-tax), respectively, of   favorable   development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. This development   was primarily due to decreases in severity as well as decreases in loss adjustment expenses related to Florida bodily injury coverages in accident years 2013 and 2014. A decrease in loss adjustment expenses related to California bodily injury coverages in accident years 2013 and 2014 also contributed to the   development during the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Refer to   Results of Operations   Underwriting   Profitability   for a more detailed discussion of our underwriting results. 
  Pre-tax net investment income declined from   $10.0 million   and   $27.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   $8.1 million   and   $25.1 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the average par value of our portfolio. In addition, pre-tax net investment income for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , included the reclassification of $1.1 million of make whole proceeds which were previously included in realized gains and losses.    
  Our book value per share   increased     3.1%   from   $61.66   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $63.56   at   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   was primarily due to earnings and   an increase   in unrealized gains, partially offset by shareholder dividends and share repurchases during the year. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  Underwriting 
  Premium 
  Our insurance subsidiaries provide personal automobile insurance products with a concentration on nonstandard auto insurance. While there is no industry-recognized definition of nonstandard auto insurance, we believe that it is generally understood to mean coverage for drivers who, due to factors such as their driving record, driving experience, lapse in, or the absence of, prior insurance, or credit history, represent a higher than normal risk. Customers in the market for nonstandard auto insurance generally seek minimum required liability limits and are willing to accept restrictive coverages in exchange for more affordable insurance, given their risk profile. We also write commercial vehicle insurance and insurance for classic collectible automobiles (Classic Collector). 
  We are licensed to write insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but we focus our operations in targeted urban areas identified in selected Focus States (defined below) that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for premium growth and profitability. 
  We classify the states in which we operate into two categories: 
             
     Focus States    Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. 
                
     Other States    States where we are running off our business. 
     We continually evaluate our market opportunities; thus, the Focus States and Other States may change over time as new market opportunities arise, as the allocation of resources changes or as regulatory environments change.

Our net earned premium was as follows ($ in thousands): 

The following table summarizes our policies in force: 

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we implemented rate revisions in various states with an overall rate   increase   of   7.7%  . Policies in force at   September 30, 2016  ,   decreased     6.1%   compared with the same period in   2015  .  
  The   increase   in gross written premium in our Focus States during the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to higher average premiums on renewal business in California and growth in Texas. The   decline   in gross written premium in our Focus States for

  INFINITY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CORPORATION FORM 10-Q 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to a reduction in new business in California during the first half of   2016   in response to rate increases totaling   5.3%   implemented during the year, and renewal business in Florida primarily as a result of rate increases totaling   12.8%   during the year, partially offset by growth in Texas.  
  The gross written premium   growth   in our Commercial Vehicle product during the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016 was primarily due to renewal policy growth and higher average premium in California and Texas. 
  Profitability 
  A key operating performance measure of insurance companies is underwriting profitability, as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings. We measure underwriting profitability by the combined ratio. When the combined ratio is under 100%, we consider underwriting results profitable; when the ratio is over 100%, we consider underwriting results unprofitable. The combined ratio does not reflect investment income, other income, interest expense, corporate general and administrative expenses, other expenses or federal income taxes. 
  In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we report results on a statutory basis for insurance regulatory purposes. We evaluate underwriting profitability based on a combined ratio calculated using statutory accounting principles. The statutory combined ratio represents the sum of the following ratios: (i) losses and LAE incurred as a percentage of net earned premium; and (ii) underwriting expenses incurred, net of installment and other fees, as a percentage of net written premium. Certain expenses are treated differently under statutory and GAAP accounting principles. Under GAAP, commissions, premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premium is earned. On a statutory basis, these items are expensed as incurred. Additionally, bad debt charge-offs on agent balances and premium receivables are included only in the GAAP combined ratios. 
  The discussion of underwriting results that follows focuses on statutory ratios and the components thereof, unless otherwise indicated.

The following table presents statutory and GAAP combined ratios:    

The statutory combined ratio for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   increased   by   6.1     points   and   2.7     points  , respectively, from the same periods of   2015  . The   third   quarter of   2016   included   $6.0 million   of   unfavorable   development from the   first   two accident quarters of   2016   compared with   $2.4 million   of   unfavorable   development during the   third   quarter of   2015   from the   first   two accident quarters of   2015  . The   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   included   $0.6 million   and   $18.6 million  , respectively, of   favorable   reserve development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves primarily due to   decreases in severity estimates related to Florida personal injury protection and bodily injury coverages related to accident years 2015 and prior, partially offset by unfavorable development from accident year 2015 in California material damage coverages and in bodily injury coverages in our commercial vehicle product, driven by an increase in severity.   The   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015   included   $11.3 million   and   $24.0 million  , respectively, of   favorable   development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. Excluding the effect of development, the statutory combined ratio   increased     1.8     points   and   2.1     points   during the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with the same periods of   2015  .  
  The GAAP combined ratio for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   increased   by   6.1     points   and   2.7     points  , respectively, from the same periods of   2015  . Excluding the effect of development, the GAAP combined ratio   increased   by   1.8     points   and   2.2     points   during the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  , respectively, primarily due to a higher accident year loss ratio as a result of increasing loss costs in material damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages.

We had net loss recoveries from catastrophes for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , of   $0.3 million  , compared with losses of   $0.3 million   for the same period of   2015  . Losses from catastrophes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $6.1 million  , compared with   $1.4 million   for the same period of   2015  . 
  The   6.8     points   and   4.7     points     increase   in the Focus States combined ratio for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the same periods of   2015  , was primarily due to an increase in the 2016 accident year loss ratio in California as a result of higher loss costs from material damage and bodily injury coverages. 
  The   3.3     points     decrease   in the Commercial Vehicle combined ratio for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to an improvement in the current accident year loss and LAE ratio, partially offset by a higher expense ratio as a result of returned ceding commission on a terminated excess of loss reinsurance contract. Refer to   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Reinsurance   for more information on the modification to our excess of loss reinsurance program. 
  Installment and Other Fee Income 

The   increase   in installment and other fee income charged to policyholders during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily related to an increase in processing fees. 
  Net Investment Income 
  Net investment income is comprised of gross investment income less investment management fees and expenses, as shown in the following table ($ in thousands): 

Pre-tax net investment income declined from   $10.0 million   and   $27.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   $8.1 million   and   $25.1 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the average par value of our portfolio. In addition, pre-tax net investment income for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , included the reclassification of $1.1 million of make whole proceeds which were previously included in realized gains and losses.    
  The book yield on our portfolio continues to exceed our new money rates. Therefore, we expect investment returns will gradually decline as proceeds from maturing or prepaid investments are expected to be reinvested at yields lower than the average book yield for the total portfolio.

The following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments at   September 30, 2016  , which are sensitive to interest rate risk. The table shows expected principal cash flows by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and collectively for all years thereafter. Callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield. Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns. 

The cash flows presented take into consideration historical relationships of market yields and prepayment rates. However, the actual prepayment rate may differ from historical trends, resulting in actual principal cash flows that differ from those presented above. 
  Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments 
  We recorded net realized gains (losses) on sales and impairments for unrealized losses deemed other-than-temporary as follows (before tax, $ in thousands): 

For our securities held with unrealized losses, we believe, based on our analysis, that (i) we will recover our cost basis in these securities; and (ii) we do not intend to sell the securities nor is it more likely than not that there will be a requirement to sell the securities before they recover in value. Should either of these beliefs change with regard to a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to predict accurately if or when a specific security will become impaired, charges for other-than-temporary impairments could be material to results of operations in a future period.

Interest Expense 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had $  275 million   principal outstanding of senior notes. These notes carry a coupon rate of 5.0% and require no principal payment until maturity in September 2022. Refer to    Note 5   Long-Term Debt    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 5.0% Senior Notes.  
  Income Taxes 
  Our GAAP effective tax rate was   13.8%   and   28.4%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   31.0%   and   31.2%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The GAAP effective tax rate has   decreased   in   2016   primarily as a result of a more significant impact from tax-exempt interest and the dividends-received deduction due to lower pre-tax income. Refer to    Note 6   Income Taxes    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Sources of Funds 
  We are a holding company and our insurance subsidiaries conduct our operations. Accordingly, we will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, share repurchases and taxes. 
  Funds to meet expenditures at the holding company level come primarily from dividends and tax payments from the insurance subsidiaries, as well as cash and investments held by the holding company. As of   September 30, 2016  , the holding company had   $149.6 million   of cash and investments. In   2016   our insurance subsidiaries may pay us up to   $59.6 million   in ordinary dividends without prior regulatory approval. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our insurance subsidiaries have paid us ordinary dividends of   $44.0 million  . 
  Our insurance subsidiaries generate liquidity to satisfy their obligations primarily by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims and generating investment income on their   $1.4 billion   investment portfolio. Our insurance subsidiaries generated   positive   cash flows from operations of   $21.2 million   and   $58.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   positive   operating cash flows of   $23.8 million   and   $79.9 million   during the same periods of   2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had $275 million principal outstanding of 5.0% Senior Notes. The 5.0% Senior Notes accrue interest at 5.0%, payable semiannually each March and September. Refer to    Note 5   Long-Term Debt    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt. 
  In August 2014 we renewed our agreement for a $50 million three-year revolving credit facility (the  Credit Agreement ) that requires us to meet certain financial and other covenants. We are currently in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement, and as of   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings outstanding against it. 
  On February 29, 2016, we filed a "shelf" registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering securities, and as long as it remains effective, it will allow us to sell any combination of senior or subordinated debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units in one or more offerings should we choose to do so in the future. This shelf registration statement expires March 1, 2019. 
  Uses of Funds 
  In February 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend to   $0.52   per share from   $0.43   per share. At this current amount, our   2016   annualized dividend payments would be approximately   $23.0 million  .

On November 4, 2014, our Board of Directors increased the authority of our share and debt repurchase program to a total of $75 million and extended the date to execute the program from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2016.   On November 1, 2016, our Board approved the extension of the date to execute the program from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $36.2 million   of authority remaining under this program. Share repurchases during the first   nine   months of   2016   were as follows:  

We believe that cash balances, cash flows generated from operations or borrowings, and maturities and sales of investments are adequate to meet our future liquidity needs and those of our insurance subsidiaries. 
  Reinsurance 
  Premium ceded under all reinsurance agreements for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $2.3 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively, compared with   $3.6 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively, for the same periods of   2015  . Effective June 1, 2016, we modified our excess of loss reinsurance protection for commercial auto to cover losses up to $500,000 for claims in excess of $500,000 per occurrence. In addition, we added a 75% quota share for our general liability business. Premium ceded for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , includes the return of $5.9 million of unearned premium due to the termination of the previous excess of loss contract. The $1.8 million of ceding commissions associated with this unearned premium was returned to the reinsurers. Refer to   Note 11 - Reinsurance   to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for more information on our reinsurance contracts. 
  Investments 
  Our consolidated investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , contained approximately   $1.4 billion   in fixed maturity securities,   $92.8 million   in equity securities and   $2.3 million   of short-term investments. All of these are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders  equity, on an after-tax basis. At   September 30, 2016  , we had pre-tax net unrealized gains of   $25.1 million   on fixed maturities and pre-tax net unrealized gains of   $15.7 million   on equity securities. Combined, the pre-tax net unrealized gain   increased   by   $29.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This   increase   occurred as a result of lower market interest rates affecting our fixed portfolio. The average option adjusted duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was   2.6   years at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   3.2   years at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Since we carry all of these securities at fair value in our balance sheet, there is virtually no effect on liquidity or financial condition upon the sale and ultimate realization of unrealized gains and losses.  
  Approximately   91.6%   of our fixed maturity investments at   September 30, 2016  , were rated  investment grade,  and, as of the same date, the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was   AA-  . Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non-investment grade. We believe that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return. 
  Fair values of instruments are based on (i) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1); (ii) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets (Level 2); or (iii) valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace (Level 3). 
  Our Level 1 securities are U.S. Treasury securities, an exchange-traded fund and equity securities held in a rabbi trust. Our Level 2 securities are comprised of securities whose fair value was determined using observable market inputs. Our Level 3 securities are comprised of (i) securities for which there is no active or inactive market for similar instruments; (ii) securities whose fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs; and (iii) securities that nationally recognized statistical rating organizations do not rate.

Summarized information for our investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , was as follows ($ in thousands):   

  We categorize securities by rating based upon available ratings issued by Moody's, Standard   Poor's or Fitch. If all three ratings are available but not equivalent, we exclude the lowest rating and the lower of the remaining ratings is used. If ratings are only available from two agencies, the lowest is used. This methodology is consistent with that used by the major bond indices. State and municipal bond ratings presented are underlying ratings without regard to any insurance.
