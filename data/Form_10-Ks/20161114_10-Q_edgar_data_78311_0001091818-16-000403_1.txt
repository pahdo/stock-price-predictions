The results of operations for these periods are not necessarily comparable to, or indicative of, results of any other interim period or for the fiscal year taken as a whole.  Certain information that is not required for interim financial reporting purposes has been omitted.

   NOTE D   Acquisition   iPoint Television   
   
 On January 15, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of 90% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of iPoint.  Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Agreement the Company issued Clark Ortiz, the Company s CEO and Chairman, 25,000,000 shares of Swordfish s Series A Preferred Stock, which has voting rights equal to 100 shares of the Company s common stock and is convertible into the Company s common stock at the rate of 10 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.  In addition to issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company agreed as part of the purchase price to issue 50,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Ortiz.  At the date of the transaction, the Company didn t have any authorized and unissued shares available to issue to Mr. Ortiz, however in order to close the transaction, Mr. Ortiz agreed to close the transaction pending the Company increasing the authorized shares of common stock, which the Company did on March 25, 2014.  As a result of the transaction, the Company owns 90% of issued and outstanding membership interests in iPoint Television LLC and is therefore a majority owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company will be able to report the results of iPoint on a consolidated basis in the Company s financial statements.  iPoint Television, also known as iPoint TV, is a Smart media and entertainment company, which holds development licenses from Apple, Android, Google, Roku, Kindle and most every smart device.  iPoint is  a full service Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), media entertainment company which develops applications for mobile and TV smart devices. As an acquisition of common control we are recording the assets acquired at their cost which is $0. The Company incurred $2,500 of acquisition expense which was expensed. iPoint did not have any results from operations from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2016.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE G   Convertible Promissory Notes Payable   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has outstanding ten (10) security purchase agreements with accredited investors for the sale of convertible promissory notes bearing interest at 10% - 12%, per annum.  Pursuant to the convertible promissory notes the investor may convert the amount paid towards the Securities Purchase Agreements into common stock of the Company.  Conversion prices vary based on the agreements and have various discount rates and terms. Trading price means the closing bid price on the OTC Market Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board Pink Sheets. 
   
 The conversion rights embedded in the Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the down round feature of the conversion price.  The beneficial conversion feature was valued at the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing model with the following assumptions:  risk free interest rates ranging from .07% to .45%, contractual expected life of six (6) to twelve (12) months, expected volatility of 185% to 931%, calculated using the historical closing price of the company s common stock, and dividend yield of zero, resulting in fair market value. 
   
    The Company had convertible debentures outstanding as follows:

SOOUM CORP.  
   New York, New York   
   
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
   NOTE L   Fair Value    
   
 The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based upon the fair value hierarchy specified by GAAP.  All assets and liabilities are recorded at historical cost which approximates fair value, and therefore, no items were valued according to these inputs. 
   
 The levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;  

Level 2 inputs utilize other-than-quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and  

Level 3 inputs are unobservable and are typically based on our own assumptions, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.  
   
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the Company categorizes such financial asset or liability based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
   
 Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that are classified within the Level 3 category.  All assets and liabilities are at cost which approximates fair value and there are not items that were required to be valued on a non-recurring basis. 
   
 The following liabilities were valued at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. No other items were valued at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

   NOTE M   Other Matters

Western Grade will therefore be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
   
  NOTE N   Subsequent Events  
   
 On October 6, 2016 the Company closed on the Western Grade acquisition and issued 445,000,000 shares of common stock in a share exchange.

Item 2:  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   
   
  Results of Operations  
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $669 and $-0-, respectively. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was ($350,797) compared to net income of $2,352,154 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 Total operating expenses were $706,376 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $135,657 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were general and administrative expenses of $165,543 and interest expense of approximately $540,833 compared to general and administrative expenses of $69,504 and interest expense of approximately $66,153 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 Total Other (Income) and Expenses were ($355,408) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to ($2,487,811) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   The primary other income and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were gain on derivative of ($355,408) compared to gain on conversion feature of preferred shares of ($2,573,744) and loss on derivative of $85,933 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,756 and $45,900, respectively.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,040,282 compared to net income of $12,304,194 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 Total operating expenses were $875,485 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $427,661 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were general and administrative expenses of $279,280 and interest expense of approximately $596,205 compared to general and administrative expenses of $201,285 and interest expense of $226,376, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Total Other (Income) and Expenses were ($6,912,946) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to ($12,728,995) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The primary other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were gain on derivative of ($362,330) and write off of liabilities of ($6,550,616) compared to gain on conversion feature of preferred shares of ($12,845,480) and loss on derivative of $116,485 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Our operations used approximately $41,418 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash required during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 came principally from cash proceeds from notes payable affiliates of $4,682 and proceeds from convertible notes payable of $44,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Our operations used approximately $9,317 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash required during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, came principally from cash proceeds from notes payable affiliates of $4,566 and proceeds from convertible notes payable of $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  We incurred net income of $6,040,282 and $12,304,194, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $ 9,070,548 as of September 30, 2016.  We have managed our liquidity during the first, second and third quarters of 2016 through revenues and issuance of notes.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
  Item 3:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  
   
 Not applicable. 

15  

Item 4:   Controls and Procedures   
   
  (a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  
   
 Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, primarily due to the fact that there is no effective separation of duties, which includes monitoring controls between the management. 
     
  (b)  Changes in internal controls .   
     
 There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or other factors that would significantly affect such controls and procedures subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation. Therefore, no corrective actions were taken.
