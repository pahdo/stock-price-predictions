NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have
been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. The information furnished in the interim consolidated
financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are
necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements. Although management believes the disclosures and information presented
are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction
with the Company s most recent audited financial statements and notes thereto for the period ended December 31, 2015 in our
Form 10-K filed on April 7, 2016 with the SEC. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period. 

Business Description  

VPR Brands, LP (the  Company ,  we ,
 our ) was incorporated in New York on July 19, 2004, as Jobsinsite.com, Inc. Our articles of incorporation were amended
on August 5, 2004, to change our name to Jobsinsite, Inc. On June 18, 2009 we merged with a Delaware corporation and became Jobsinsite,
Inc., and on July 1, 2009 we filed articles of conversion with the secretary of state of Delaware and became Soleil Capital L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership. On September 2, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to VPR Brands,
LP. We are managed by Soleil Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. 

The Company is engaged in various monetization strategies of
a portfolio of patents the Company owns in both the US and China, covering electronic cigarette, electronic cigar and personal
vaporizer patents. We currently market a brand of electronic cigarette e-liquids marketed under the brand  Helium 
in the United States and are undertaking efforts to establish distribution of our electronic cigarette e-liquids brand in China.
We are currently also identifying electronic cigarette companies that may be infringing our patents and exploring options to license
and or enforce our patents. 

On March 4, 2016, the Company announced a new e-liquid innovation,
namely Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid, that is chilled 20 degrees below room temperature by mini-chillers or desktop chillers designed
by the Company to maintain optimum flavor, freshness and aroma by cooling the e-liquids (reducing the escape of molecules from
the mixture of e-liquids into the headspace). Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid will come in (i) a 50ml, squeezable bottle with a drip
tip, for our mini chillers, (ii) a 180ml bottle for our personal desktop chiller, or (iii) a sample pack of the 5 flavors offered
which are a one-time use in 2ml tubes that are air tight. Helium Hi Definition E-Liquids were available for pre-orders on March
15, 2016 on VapeHelium.com and have been available for sale in Vape shops in the United States since April 1, 2016. 

On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Vapor Corp. ( Vapor ) and the Company 
Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor s
wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively,  Assets ) to the Company, which Vapor s business
is operated at 3001 Griffin Road, Dania Beach, Florida 33312 (the  Dania Beach Premises ). The transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement closed on July 29, 2016. 

See note 4, Asset Purchase and Secured
Borrowing for further details, concerning total considerations.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash    

Cash includes all cash deposits and highly liquid financial
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values, in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 718. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange
for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company had no common stock options or common
stock equivalents granted or outstanding for all periods presented. The Company may issue shares as compensation in future periods
for employee services. 

The Company may issue restricted stock to consultants for various
services. Cost for these transactions will be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the
equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the common stock is to be measured at the earlier
of: (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (ii)
the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. The Company may issue shares as compensation in future periods for
services associated with the registration of the common shares. 

Revenue recognition   

The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 for revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; the delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably
assured. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   

Net loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of shares was calculated
by taking the number of shares outstanding and weighting them by the amount of time that they were outstanding. Diluted net loss
per share for the Company is the same as basic net loss per share, as the inclusion of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive. 

Income taxes   

The Company is considered a partnership for income tax purposes.
Accordingly, the partners report the Partnership s taxable income or loss on their individual tax returns. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s accounting
and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which
the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not
be material to it financial position, results of operations, and cash flow when implemented. 

8   

NOTE 3: GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business. The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception, has incurred a net loss of $208,821
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and has an accumulated deficit of $5,846,919 at September 30, 2016. The continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, the continued financial support from its shareholders,
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance
that the Company will be able to generate revenues in the future. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments
that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE 4: ASSET PURCHASE AND SECURED BORROWING  

On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Vapor Corp. ( Vapor ) and the Company 
Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor s
wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively,  Assets ) to the Company. The transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement closed on July 29, 2016. 

The consideration consisted of:  

A secured, one-year promissory note from the Company to Vapor in the principal amount of $370,000 (the  Acquisition Note ) bearing an interest rate of 4.5%, which payments thereunder are $10,000 per month, with such payments deferred and commencing on October 28, 2016, with a balloon payment of the remainder of principal and interest on July 29, 2017. Current balance including accrued interest is $288,171.   

In exchange for a $500,000 loan from Vapor to the Company, a secured, 36-month promissory note from the Company to Vapor in the principal amount of $500,000 (the  Secured Promissory Note  together with the Acquisition Note, are referred to herein as the  Notes ) bearing an interest rate of prime plus 2% (which rate resets annually on July 29th), which payments thereunder are $14,000 per month, with such payments deferred and commencing on January 26, 2017, with subsequent installments payable on the same day of each month thereafter and in the 37th month (on July 29, 2019), a balloon payment for all remaining accrued interest and principal. Current balance including accrued interest is $504,747.   

The assumption by the Company of certain liabilities related to Vapor s wholesale operations, including but not limited to the month-to-month lease for the Dania Beach Premises ( Assumption of Liabilities ).   

Notwithstanding the above, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
Vapor continues to own its accounts receivable from its wholesale operations as of July 29, 2016. However, Vapor agreed to use
its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with standard industry practice, to collect such accounts receivable, and any and
all amounts so collected (i) up to $150,000 (net of any refunds) in the aggregate shall be credited against payment of the Acquisition
Note and (ii) in excess of $150,000 (up to $95,800) will be transferred to Mr. Frija as consideration for the transfer to Vapor
by Mr. Frija of 1,405,910,203 shares of Vapor s common stock that he had acquired on the open market ( Retired Shares ). 

The Purchase Agreement contained customary
representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company and Vapor. Vapor also agreed to a restrictive covenant prohibiting it
from competing with the Company for a period of three years in the wholesale distribution of electronic cigarette products that
comprise the Assets. 

9   

The purchase consideration paid to the
Seller was allocated to the preliminary fair value of the net tangible assets acquired, The preliminary purchase price allocation
was based, in part, on management s knowledge of Vapor Corp. business. 

The following presents the unaudited pro-forma
combined results of operations of the Company with Vapor Corp. as if both Acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015. 

The unaudited pro-forma results of
operations are presented for information purposes only and are based on estimated financial operations. The unaudited
pro-forma results of operations are not intended to present actual results that would have been attained had the Company
closed the acquisition effective 1/1/15. 

NOTE 5: RELATED PARTY   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
used the services of a related party of the Company owned by its CEO, and incurred cost of $21,393.

In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company
named Kevin Frija chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the Company s
general partner, Soleil Capital Management LLC (the  General Partner ). Contemporaneous with Mr. Frija s appointment

the escape of molecules from the mixture of e-liquids into the headspace). Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid will come in (i) a 50ml,
squeezable bottle with a drip tip, for our mini chillers, (ii) a 180ml bottle for our personal desktop chiller, or (iii) a sample
pack of the 5 

12   

flavors offered which are a one-time use in 2ml tubes that are air tight. Helium Hi Definition E-Liquids were available
for pre-orders on March 15, 2016 on VapeHelium.com and will be available for sale in Vape shops in the United States by April 1,
2016. 

Our portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer
patents (the  Patents ) are the basis for our efforts to: 

Design, market and distribute a line of e-liquids under the  HELUIM  brand;  

Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes;  

Prosecute and enforce our patent rights;  

License our intellectual property; and  

Develop private label manufacturing programs.  

Our branded electronic cigarette e-liquids:
HELIUM 

We design, develop and market electronic
cigarette e-liquids sold under the Heluim brand. Our electronic cigarette e-liquids are marketed as an alternative to tobacco burning
cigarettes. We launched the Heluim brand in limited U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and grow distribution through third
party distributors. Shortly after our U.S. launch we plan to introduce our electronic cigarette brand to the Chinese market. China
is the largest producer and consumer of tobacco products in the world, however we believe that Chinese consumption of electronic
cigarettes trails U.S. adoption and use. We believe that an opportunity exists to develop and expand our business and our Helium
brand electronic cigarette e-liquids in China. 

Recent Developments   

On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into
an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Vapor Corp. ( Vapor ) and the Company 
Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor s
wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively,  Assets ) to the Company, which Vapor s business
is operated at 3001 Griffin Road, Dania Beach, Florida 33312 (the  Dania Beach Premises ). The transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement closed on July 29, 2016. 

The consideration consisted of:  

A secured, one-year promissory note from the Company to Vapor in the principal amount of $370,000 (the  Acquisition Note ) bearing an interest rate of 4.5%, which payments thereunder are $10,000 per month, with such payments deferred and commencing on October 28, 2016, with a balloon payment of the remainder of principal and interest on July 29, 2017.   

In exchange for a $500,000 loan from Vapor to the Company, a secured, 36-month promissory note from the Company to Vapor in the principal amount of $500,000 (the  Secured Promissory Note  together with the Acquisition Note, are referred to herein as the  Notes ) bearing an interest rate of prime plus 2% (which rate resets annually on July 29th), which payments thereunder are $14,000 per month, with such payments deferred and commencing on January 26, 2017, with subsequent installments payable on the same day of each month thereafter and in the 37th month (on July 29, 2019), a balloon payment for all remaining accrued interest and principal.   

The assumption by the Company of certain liabilities related to Vapor s wholesale operations, including but not limited to the month-to-month lease for the Dania Beach Premises ( Assumption of Liabilities ).   

Notwithstanding the above, pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement, Vapor continues to own its accounts receivable from its wholesale operations as of July 29, 2016. However,
Vapor agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts, 

13   

consistent with standard industry practice, to collect such accounts receivable,
and any and all amounts so collected (i) up to $150,000 (net of any refunds) in the aggregate shall be credited against payment
of the Acquisition Note and (ii) in excess of $150,000 (up to $95,800) will be transferred to Mr. Frija as consideration for the
transfer to Vapor by Mr. Frija of 1,405,910,203 shares of Vapor s common stock that he had acquired on the open market ( Retired
Shares ). 

The Purchase Agreement contained customary
representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company and Vapor. Vapor also agreed to a restrictive covenant prohibiting it
from competing with the Company for a period of three years in the wholesale distribution of electronic cigarette products that
comprise the Assets.  

Results of Operations:  

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Our financial
statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. 

Our financial statements have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and
realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We will require additional capital to meet
our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of our products
and through equity or debt securities.

accounts receivable collected of $219,353. Accounts receivable collected mainly result of those acquired from Vapor Corp. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 the Company was provided cash from financing activities of $615,625 and $100,000, respectively. The proceeds
were from a $500,000 loan from Vapor Corp and $200,000 of proceeds from a private placement from the CEO. As per terms of the agreements
previously discussed. 

Assets  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,

fixed assets and inventory of $866,540. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the assets consisted of $54,700 in advances to suppliers
and $4,650 in cash. 

Liabilities  

Our total liabilities, consisting of accounts
payable and notes payable, were $852,511 at September 30, 2016, compared to $16,815 at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in notes payable of $792,918 as part of the loans by Vapor Corp. in connection with the acquisition of assets
from Vapor Corp. 

At this time, we have not secured or identified
any additional financing to execute our plan of operations over the next 12 months. We do not have any firm commitments nor have
we identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from shareholders. There can be no assurance that additional
capital will be available to us, or that, if available, it will be on terms satisfactory to us. Any additional financing may involve
dilution to our shareholders. In the alternative, additional funds may be provided from cash flow in excess of that needed to finance
our day-to-day operations, although we may never generate this excess cash flow. If we do not raise additional capital or generate
additional funds, implementation of our plans for expansion will be delayed. If necessary, we may withdraw from certain growth
strategies to conserve cash for continued operation. 

Off  Balance Sheet Operations  

We do not have any off-balance sheet operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

With respect to the period ending September
30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Based upon our evaluation regarding the
period ending September 30, 2016, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of continued material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 which
was filed on April 7, 2016, which material weakness are reiterated below. 

15   

The Company did not maintain an effective
financial reporting process to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Specifically, our process lacked timely
and complete financial statement reviews and procedures to ensure all required disclosures were made in our financial statements.
Also, the Company lacked documented procedures including documentation related to testing of internal controls and entity-level
controls, disclosure review, and other analytics. Furthermore, the Company lacked sufficient personnel to properly segregate duties.
Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

A material weakness (within the meaning
of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention by those
responsible for oversight of the Company s financial reporting. 

Remedial Efforts Related to the Material
Weakness in Internal Control     

In an effort to address the material weakness,
we have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, the following remedial steps: 

We intend to establish an audit committee of the board of directors as
    soon as practicable. We envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed
    by our independent auditors, evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls.  

We intend to establish an internal audit function and engage a public
    accounting firm to perform internal audit services under an outsourcing arrangement. We intend for the internal audit service
    provider to review the policies, procedures and systems to address the material weakness.   

In addition to supervising all financial aspects of the Company, our
    Chief Financial Officer is also supervising our Information Technology ( IT ) functions to better facilitate the
    coordination and development of improved systems to support our financial reporting process.  

In furtherance of timely and complete financial statement reviews and
    procedures to ensure all required disclosures are made in our financial statements and promoting the segregation of duties,
    we have (i) hired experienced accounting personnel and expect to hire additional experienced accounting personnel, (ii) hired
    staff to handle the increased workload associated with the reporting structure in place and continue to recruit additional
    staff in key areas including financial reporting and tax accounting as well as we have engaged temporary staff and (iii) hired
    consultants to assist in achieving accurate and timely reporting, including hiring additional consultants to assist in the
    development and enhancement of IT infrastructure systems to support accounting.  

We have provided and will continue to provide training to our finance and accounting personnel for timely and accurate preparation and management review of documentation to support our financial reporting and period-end close procedures including documentation related to testing of internal controls and entity-level controls, disclosure review, and other analytics.   

We have been conducting and continue to conduct the assessment and review of our accounting general ledger system to further identify changes that can be made to improve our overall control environment with respect to journal entries. We are continuing to implement more formal procedures related to the review and approval of journal entries.    

We have been formalizing the periodic account reconciliation process for all significant balance sheet accounts. We are continuing to implement more formal review of these reconciliations by our accounting management and we will increase the number of supervisory personnel to ensure that reviews are performed.    

16   

We believe these additional internal controls
will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above; however, we may determine to modify the remediation plan
described above by adding remedial steps to or modifying or no longer pursuing (if determined to be unnecessary in remediating
the material weakness) the remedial steps set forth above. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented, the
material weakness described above will continue to exist. Notwithstanding, through the use of external consultants and the review
process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

The Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the Company s management,
including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
