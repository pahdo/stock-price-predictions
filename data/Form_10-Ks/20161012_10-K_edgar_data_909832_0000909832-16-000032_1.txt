  PART I 
   
  Item 1 Business 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Australia, Spain, and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Costco operated   715  , 686, and 663 warehouses worldwide at August 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August 31, 2014, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol  COST.  
  We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2016, 2015, and 2014 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August  31, 2014, respectively. 
  General 
  We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. 
  We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to our individual warehouses. This process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.

  Item 1 Business (Continued) 

Our average warehouse space is approximately 144,000 square feet, with newer units slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations. 
  Marketing activities for new locations generally include community outreach to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members. Ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers, The Costco Connection (a magazine we publish for our members), and promotional e-mails to members. 
  Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain debit and credit cards, co-branded Costco credit cards, cash, or checks.  
  Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. 
  In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. 
  We offer merchandise in the following categories: 
             
    Foods   (including dry foods, packaged foods, and groceries) 
                
    Sundries   (including snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies) 
                
    Hardlines   (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio) 
                
    Fresh Foods   (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) 
                
    Softlines   (including apparel and small appliances) 
                
    Other   (including gas stations and pharmacy) 
     Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. We sell gasoline in all countries except Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan and operated 508, 472, and 445 gas stations at the end of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Ancillary businesses also include optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. 
  Our online businesses, which include e-commerce, business delivery, and travel, operate websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, and Spain. They provide our members additional products and services, typically not found in our warehouses. Net sales for our online business were approximately 4% of our net sales in 2016 and 3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
  We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of

  Item 1 Business (Continued) 

our business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brand-name items. 
  Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
  Membership  
  Our members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence. Business members have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $55 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies by country in our Other International operations. All paid memberships include a free household card.  
  Our member renewal rate was   90%   in the U.S. and Canada, and   88%   on a worldwide basis in   2016  . The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date.  
  Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 

Paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $55, and in Mexico and the U.K., for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $750 per year in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico) additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by state and country. Executive members represented   39%   of paid cardholders at the end of   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  . Executive members generally spend more than other members, and where executive memberships are offered the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase.  
  Labor 
  Our employee count was as follows: 

Approximately   15,000   employees, in a minority of our locations, are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

  Item 1 Business (Continued) 

Competition 
  Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, internet retailers, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with warehouse club operations (primarily Wal-Mart s Sam s Club and BJ s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major U.S. metropolitan area has multiple club operations. 
  Intellectual Property 
  We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale        series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature.        We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items. 
  We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained. 
  Available Information 
  Our U.S. internet website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The SEC also maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.

  Item 1A Risk Factors  

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. We could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management  '  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item     7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item     8 of this Report. 
  Business and Operating Risks 
  We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. 
  Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net sales and operating income in 2016, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 31% of U.S. net sales in 2016. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members. 
  We may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. 
  We seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses. 
  We also intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include: difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new websites will be profitably deployed and, as a result, our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

Our failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business model. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations. 
  In addition, we sell many products under our private label Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our Kirkland Signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected. 
  Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. 
  We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. 
  We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption of our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business.  A failure to adequately update our existing systems and implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.  
  Given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
  We are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace critical information systems and processing. Failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation. 
  We receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service providers that perform activities for us. Our warehouse and online businesses depend upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates, that results in our members  '   information being obtained by unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations. 
  The use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries.     Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance. 
  Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business. 
  We are subject to payment-related risks. 
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ( PCI DSS ), which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. As of October 1, 2015, the payment card industry shifted the liability of certain credit card transactions to retailers who are not able to process Europay, MasterCard, Visa ( EMV ) chip enabled card transactions. As a result, before our implementation of the EVM technology is complete, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks or other third parties for fraudulent transactions initiated through EMV chip enabled cards before our implementation of EMV chip technology. Implementation of the EMV chip technology and receipt of final certification is subject to hardware installation, software modification, and certification with our third-party transaction service providers. If we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

We might sell unsafe products, resulting in illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and litigation. 
  If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children  '  s products, pet products, and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members  '   expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, and legal and reputational losses. The sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, related negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term. 
  We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. 
  It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income. 
  If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
  Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members, especially younger members, are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. As part of our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
  Inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

Market and Other External Risks 
  We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.  
  General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies, sovereign debt crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events. 
  Vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins. 
  We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As these quantities continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits. 
  We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available. 
  Our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation, and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business. 
  Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. 
  During 2016, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 39% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. Our international operations have accounted for an increasingly larger portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue expanding them. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. Future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operating segments and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase. 
  We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business. 
  We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased U.S. and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions increase our costs and resulting damage to our properties may not be fully insured.

  Item 1A Risk Factors (Continued) 

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. 
  We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market price of our stock to decline. 
  Legal and Regulatory Risks 
  Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  During 2016, we operated 214 warehouses in eight countries outside of the U.S. and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. 
  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  Accounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, merchandise inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, impairment of long-lived assets, self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. 
  Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in health care cost inflation rates inherent in these claims can affect the amounts recognized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as changes in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
  We could be subject to additional income tax liabilities. 
  We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are, or may become involved, in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item     8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management  '  s attention and resources.

  OVERVIEW 
  We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our U.S. and Canadian operations). The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. 
  Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our  pricing authority    consistently providing the most competitive values. Our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). We believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. 
  We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales. 
  Our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially influences our profitability. 
  Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that

achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. 
  Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain countries in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. Additionally, we operate our lower-margin gasoline business in all countries except Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan. 
  In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period.  The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal years   2016  ,   2015   and   2014   were 52-week fiscal years ending on   August 28, 2016  ,   August 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2014  , respectively. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 
  Highlights for fiscal year 2016 included: 
              
    Net sales increased   2%   to   $116,073  , driven by sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016, while comparable sales were flat. Net and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases in the price of gasoline; 
                
    Membership fee revenue increased 4% to   $2,646  , primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and executive membership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar; 
                
    Gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points, primarily from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales;  
                
    Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 basis points, largely driven by the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales; 
                 
    Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.24, largely driven by changes in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso; 
                
    In December 2015, we paid the outstanding principal balance and associated interest on the 0.65% Senior Notes of approximately $1,204, from our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments;  
                 
    In June 2016, we transitioned to our new Citibank-Visa exclusive co-branded credit card in the U.S. (described in further detail in Item 9B of this Report).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Sales 

2016 vs. 2015 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales increased   $2,407   or   2%   during 2016. This was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2015 and 2016. Comparable sales were flat. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,690, or 237 basis points, compared to 2015. The negative impact was attributable to most foreign countries in which we operate, predominantly Canada of $1,646, Mexico of $550, and UK of $224. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,194, or 193 basis points, due to a 19% decrease in the average sales price per gallon. 
  Comparable Sales 
  Comparable sales were flat during 2016 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency offset by a decrease in the average ticket. The average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decrease in gasoline prices. Changes in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 
  2015 vs. 2014 
  Net Sales 
  Net sales increased $3,454 or 3% during 2015. This was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2014 and 2015 and a 1% increase in comparable sales. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3,344, or 303 basis points, compared to 2014. The negative impact was attributable to all foreign countries in which we operate, predominantly Canada of

$2,027, Mexico of $385, and Japan of $368. Changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,902, or 263 basis points, due to a 22% decrease in the average sales price per gallon. 
  Comparable Sales 
  Comparable sales increased 1% during 2015 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency partially offset by a decrease in the average ticket. The average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a decrease in gasoline prices. Changes in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization. 
   
  Membership Fees 

2016 vs. 2015 
  The increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee Executive Membership program. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $52 in 2016. At the end of 2016, our member renewal rates were   90%   in the U.S. and Canada and   88%   worldwide. 
  2015 vs. 2014 
  Membership fees increased 4% in 2015. This increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee Executive Membership program. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $76 in 2015. 
   
  Gross Margin 

2016 vs. 2015 
  The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 13 basis points, primarily due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. 
  Total gross margin percentage increased 26 basis points compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.14%, an increase of five basis points. A larger LIFO benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 positively contributed three basis points. The LIFO benefit resulted largely from lower costs for merchandise inventories, primarily in food and sundries and gasoline. Our core merchandise categories positively contributed one basis point, primarily due to an

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

increase in hardlines, partially offset by food and sundries due to a decrease in sales penetration. Warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin positively contributed one basis point, primarily due to hearing aids and e-commerce businesses, partially offset by our gasoline business. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $286 in 2016. 
  Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased  in our U.S. operations, predominately due to a positive contribution from our core merchandise categories, primarily hardlines and softlines, and the LIFO benefit discussed above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased, primarily due to a decrease in all core merchandise categories, except hardlines, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily pharmacy and e-commerce businesses. The segment gross margin percentage in Other International operations decreased in all merchandise categories, except fresh foods, which was higher. 
  2015 vs. 2014 
  The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased five basis points, primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods. 
  Our gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales. Excluding this impact, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.81%, an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year. This increase was predominantly due to: an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basis points, due primarily to our gasoline business; partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points, as a result of a decrease in their sales penetration. A LIFO benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points. The LIFO benefit resulted largely from lower costs of gasoline. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $359 in 2015. 
  Segment gross margin percentage increased in our U.S. operations, primarily due to our gasoline business and the LIFO benefit discussed above. The segment gross margin percentage in our Canadian operations decreased across our core merchandise categories. The segment gross margin percentage in our Other International operations decreased, primarily in food and sundries. 
   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

2016 vs. 2015 
  SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 basis points compared to 2015. Excluding the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, SG A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 10.20%, an increase of 13 basis points. This was largely due to: higher central operating costs of six basis points, predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations; and higher stock compensation expense of four basis points, due to appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant. Our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing and expected to continue to negatively impact SG A expenses. Charges for non-recurring legal and regulatory     matters during 2016 negatively impacted SG A expenses by two basis points. Our warehouse operating costs were higher by one basis point due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs, primarily health care, i  n our U.S. operations. This increase was partially offset by lower payroll expense as a percentage of net sales in our Canadian

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

operations. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our SG A expenses by approximately $211 in 2016. 
  2015 vs. 2014 
  SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points, mostly due to the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales. Excluding this impact, SG A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 9.82%, an improvement of seven basis points. This was due to lower warehouse operating costs of 16 basis points, primarily from improvements in payroll expenses in our core business as a result of leveraging increased sales. This improvement was partially offset by higher central operating costs of five basis points, predominantly due to increased depreciation and service contract costs associated with our information systems modernization projects that were placed into service during the year, primarily incurred by our U.S. operations. Higher stock compensation expense also negatively impacted our SG A expenses by four basis points, due to an appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased our SG A expenses by approximately $282 in 2015. 
   
  Preopening Expenses 

Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses, including relocations, development in new international markets, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. 
  Interest Expense 

Interest expense in 2016 primarily relates to Senior Notes issued by the Company (described in further detail under the heading  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the Senior Notes issued in February 2015.

Interest Income and Other, Net 

2016 vs. 2015 
  The decrease in interest income in 2016 is attributable to lower average cash and investment balances, due in part to the payment of the outstanding principal balance and interest on the 0.65% Senior Notes in the second quarter of 2016 (see discussion in Item 8, Note 4 of this Report). Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts and the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations. See Derivatives and Foreign Currency sections in Item 8, Note 1 of this Report. 
  2015 vs. 2014 
  The increase in net foreign-currency transaction gains was primarily attributable to favorable mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign exchange contracts compared to the prior year. The increase was also attributable to net gains on the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities during the year. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 

In 2015, our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of $68, primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in connection with a special cash dividend paid to employees through our 401(K) Retirement Plan. Dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  The following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were   $4,729   and   $6,419   at the end of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $1,071 and $1,243 at the end of 2016 and 2015, respectively, represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables. These receivables generally settle within one week. Cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by changes in exchange rates by   $50   in 2016 and negatively impacted by   $418   and $11 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  
  We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, including the remaining undistributed earnings of our Canadian operations, because our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings,  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence. Although we have historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence. If we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, deferred taxes, to the extent required and applicable, are recorded at that time.  During 2016, we repatriated the earnings in our Canadian operations that in 2015 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we determined that a portion of the undistributed earnings in our Canadian operations could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences. Accordingly, we no longer consider that portion to be indefinitely reinvested.  
  Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at these subsidiaries with earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,535 at August 28, 2016. 
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled   $3,292   in 2016, compared to   $4,285   in 2015. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit and debit card processing fees, and utilities. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016, in advance of implementing our modernized accounting system at the beginning of fiscal 2017.  
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities totaled   $2,345   in 2016 compared to   $2,480   in 2015. Cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding warehouse expansion and remodeling activities.   Net cash flows from investing activities also included purchases and maturities of short-term investments. 
  Capital Expenditure Plans 
  We opened 29 new warehous  es and relocated four warehouses in   2016   and plan to open up to 31 new warehouses and relocate up to three warehouses in 2017. Our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our information systems, and working capital.   In     2016     we spent $2,649 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,600 to $2,800 during fiscal     2017  .     These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled   $2,419   in 2016 compared to   $2,324   in 2015. The primary uses of cash in 2016 were related to the $1,200 repayment of our 0.65% Senior Notes in December 2015, dividend payments of   $746  , repurchases of common stock, and payment of withholding taxes on stock-based awards. Net cash used in financing activities in 2015 included a $5.00 per share special cash dividend, totaling approximately $2,201, partially offset by the issuance of $1,000 in Senior Notes.

In March 2016, our Japanese subsidiary issued approximately $103 of 0.63% Guaranteed Senior Notes through a private placement. Additionally, in June 2016, our Japanese subsidiary issued approximately   $93   of   zero percent   Guaranteed Senior Notes through a private placement. Interest on both issuances are payable semi-annually, and principal is due in March 2026 and June 2021, respectively. 
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  During 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 3,184,000 and 3,456,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $149.90 and $142.87, totaling approximately $477 and $494, respectively. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was   $3,222   at the end of 2016. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. 
  Dividends 
  Cash dividends paid in   2016   totaled $1.70 per share, as compared to $6.51 per share in   2015  , which included a special cash dividend of $5.00 per share. In April 2016, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share. 
  Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs 
  We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At August 28, 2016, we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of $429, of which $358 was maintained by our international operations. Of the $358, $177 is guaranteed by the Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2016 and 2015. 
  The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $153. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2016 totaled $96, including $94 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.

Contractual Obligations 
  As of   August 28, 2016  , our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Includes only open merchandise purchase orders. 
              (2) 
    Includes contractual interest payments and excludes deferred issuance costs.  
              (3) 
    Operating lease obligations exclude amounts for common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by   $129   to reflect sub-lease income. 
              (4) 
    Includes build-to-suit lease obligations and contractual interest payments. 
              (5) 
    The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. 
              (6) 
    Includes   $64   in asset retirement obligations, and $62 in deferred compensation obligations. The total amount excludes $51 of non-current unrecognized tax contingencies and $29 of other obligations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements, that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than the operating leases included in the table above and discussed in Note 1 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.  
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires that we make estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance/self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these statements. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We generally recognize sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount is generally  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  
    
  Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)   (Continued) 

recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly. Our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis. 
  We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record a net amount, which is reflected in net sales. We record related shipping fees on a gross basis.  
  We account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $750 per year in the U.S. and Canada and varies in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. We account for this reward as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. 
  Merchandise Inventories 
  Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues.  
  We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. 
  Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic approaches. 
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair value. 
  Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities 
  We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers  compensation, general liability, property damage, directors  and officers  liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.

Income Taxes 
  The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Additionally, our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of August 28, 2016. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if we changed our position and could result in a U.S. deferred tax liability.  Although we have historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.  
   
  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions) 
  Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities, and asset and mortgage-backed securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.  
  Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage-backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA+. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries  investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers  acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.  
  A 100 basis-point change in interest rates as of the end of   2016   would have an incremental change in fair market value of $22. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders  equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
  The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2016, the majority of our long-term debt is fixed rate Senior Notes, carried at   $4,390  . Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.

  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)(Continued) 

Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk 
  Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. 
  We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. These contracts are limited to less than one year. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of   2016   and   2015  . A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at   August 28, 2016   would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $56 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominately in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the  normal purchases or normal sales  exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

  Item 9A Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended   August 28, 2016  , that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 9A Controls and Procedures (Continued) 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of   August 28, 2016  , using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   August 28, 2016  . The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Item 9B Other Information  
    
  In February 2015, we entered into a Co-Branded Credit Card Program Agreement (the  Program Agreement ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citi ). Under the terms of the Program Agreement, Citi became the exclusive issuer of our co-branded credit cards to our members. Additionally, Visa U.S.A. Inc. became the credit card network for Costco in the United States and Puerto Rico. Citi purchased the current co-branded credit card portfolio from American Express in June 2016. On June 20, 2016, we began accepting all Visa cards, including the Citi co-branded credit cards, replacing American Express. We receive various forms of consideration under the Program Agreement. The initial term of the Program Agreement is ten years. 
    
  Under the Program Agreement, Costco earns a royalty on purchases made with the co-branded card other than from Costco ("external spend"). The royalty varies based on the amount of external spend in relation to total spend. In addition, Costco will fund a portion of the loyalty reward cardholders earn under the program on external spend. Loyalty rewards under the program are as follows: 4% on eligible gasoline purchases, 3% on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% on all purchases from Costco and Costco.com, and 1% on all other purchases. These rewards may be adjusted over the term of the program. The loyalty rewards earned by co-branded cardholders will be in the form of certificates redeemable at Costco, for cash or merchandise. Costco also receives a bounty on approved new credit card accounts acquired through Costco

channels. Additionally, the base discount Costco pays related to Visa acceptance is lower than previously paid for American Express acceptance.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation: 
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of   August 28, 2016   and   August 30, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week periods ended   August 28, 2016  ,   August 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2014  . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
    
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of   August 28, 2016   and   August 30, 2015  , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52-week periods ended    August 28, 2016  ,   August 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2014  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Costco Wholesale Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of   August 28, 2016  , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated   October 11, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation: 
    
  We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of   August 28, 2016  , based on criteria established in     Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
    
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
    
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   August 28, 2016  , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).  
    
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company  as of   August 28, 2016   and   August 30, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended   August 28, 2016  ,   August 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2014  , and our report dated   October 11, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Description of Business 
  Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At   August 28, 2016  , Costco operated   715   warehouses worldwide:   501   United States (U.S.) locations (in   44   U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico),   91   Canada locations,   36   Mexico locations,   28   United Kingdom (U.K.) locations,   25   Japan locations,   12   Korea locations,   12   Taiwan locations,   eight   Australia locations, and   two   Spain locations. The Company's online business operates websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, and Spain. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company s net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests in its operations in Taiwan and Korea. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. 
  Fiscal Year End 
  The Company operates on a   52/53   week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   relate to the   52  -week fiscal years ended   August 28, 2016  ,   August 30, 2015  , and   August 31, 2014  , respectively. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company s previously reported consolidated financial statements. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to one week. Credit and debit card receivables were $  1,071   and $  1,243   at the end of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Short-Term Investments 
  In general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company s determination,  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  
  COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (Continued) 
  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. 
  The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the credit loss component in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively. 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are: 
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market  
           data. 
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
  The Company s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred. 
  Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for any applicable unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs.

Receivables, Net 
  Receivables consist of the following at the end of   2016   and   2015  : 

Vendor receivables include volume rebates or other purchase discounts. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. The balance primarily represents amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members  insurance companies. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.  
  Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  . 
  Merchandise Inventories 
  Merchandise inventories consist of the following at the end of   2016   and   2015  : 

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation rates and inventory levels for the year have been determined. 
  Due to net deflationary trends, a benefit of   $64   and   $27   was recorded to merchandise costs in   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Due to net inflationary trends in   2014  , a charge of   $28   was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories. At the end of   2016   and   2015  , the cumulative impact of the LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories was immaterial and $  82  , respectively. 
  The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on the Company s experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable.

Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are classified into components, each with its own estimated useful life, generally   five   to   fifty   years for buildings and improvements and   three   to   twenty   years for equipment and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are made. 
  The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. These costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally   three   to   seven   years. 
  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized. Assets that were removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of   2016   and   2015   were immaterial. 
  The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in   2016  , and charges were immaterial and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income in   2015   and   2014  . 
  Accounts Payable 
  The Company s banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of   2016   and   2015   are $  619   and $  538  , respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn. The Company accelerated vendor payments of approximately $  1,700   in the last week of fiscal 2016 in advance of implementing its modernized accounting system at the beginning of fiscal 2017.  
  Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities 
  The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers  compensation, general liability, property damage, directors  and officers  liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of   2016   and   2015  , these insurance liabilities were $  1,021   and $  993   in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.

The Company s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit any participating members  individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreement. 
  Other Current Liabilities 
  Other current liabilities consist of the following at the end of   2016   and   2015  : 

Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company s international subsidiaries, with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $  572   and $  889   at the end of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship. There can be no assurance that this practice is effective. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of   2016   and   2015  . 
  The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in   2016   and   2014  , respectively, and a net gain of   $12   in   2015  .  
  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the  normal purchases or normal sales  exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Foreign Currency 
  The functional currencies of the Company s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. 
  The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items resulted in net gains of   $38  ,   $35  , and   $25   for   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company generally recognizes sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payments from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amounts received are generally recorded as deferred sales, included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or service is completed. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned. Amounts collected from members for sales or value added taxes are recorded on a net basis. 
  The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts earned, which is reflected in net sales. The Company records related shipping fees on a gross basis.  
  The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. The Company's Executive members qualify for a   2%   reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $  750   per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales. The sales reduction and corresponding liability (classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets) are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $  1,172  , $  1,128  , and $  1,051   in   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. 
  Merchandise Costs 
  Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company s depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments. 
  Vendor Consideration 
  The Company has agreements with vendors to receive funds for volume rebates and a variety of other programs. Volume rebates or other purchase discounts are evidenced by signed agreements that are

     Table of Contents  
  COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data) (Continued) 
  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers  compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, and stock-based compensation expense as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations. 
  Retirement Plans 
  The Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan is available to all U.S. employees who have completed   90 days   of employment. The plan allows pre-tax deferrals, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for Canadian employees and contributes a percentage of each employee's salary. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were   $489  ,   $454  , and   $436   for   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over   five   years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The Company does not reduce stock-based compensation for an estimate of forfeitures, which are inconsequential in light of historical experience and considering the awards vest on a quarterly basis. Actual forfeitures are recognized as they occur.  
  Compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. The terms of the Company s stock-based awards for employees and non-employee directors provide for accelerated vesting of a portion of outstanding shares based on reaching certain cumulative years of service with the Company. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.  
  Stock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company s stock-based compensation plans. 
  Leases 
  The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities, primarily under operating leases. Operating leases expire at various dates through   2064  , with the exception of one lease in the Company s U.K. subsidiary, which expires in   2151  . These leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated  
  
   52 

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer. 
  The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. 
  The Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through   2054  . Capital lease assets are included in land and buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded as depreciation expense and is predominately included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capital lease liabilities are recorded at the lesser of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest on these obligations is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.  
  The Company records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where it is considered the owner for accounting purposes, to the extent the Company is involved in the construction of the building or structural improvements or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease.  Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for the arrangement as a financing lease.   
  The Company s asset retirement obligations (ARO) are primarily related to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed in order to comply with the lease agreement. These obligations are recorded as a liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the leasehold improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation using the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the respective leasehold improvement assets and are included with buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases amounted to $  64   and $  54   at the end of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  Preopening Expenses 
  Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized. 
  The determination of the Company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. Additionally, certain of the Company's cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of August 28, 2016. These earnings would be subject to U.S. income tax if we changed our position and could result in a U.S. tax liability. Although the Company has historically asserted that certain non-U.S. undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, it may repatriate such earnings to the extent it can do so without an adverse tax consequence. See Note 8 for additional information. 
  Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco 
  The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs and the  if converted  method for the convertible note securities. 
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by jurisdiction, along with any related valuation allowance. The guidance requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the guidance at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis and reclassified deferred tax assets and liabilities from current to non-current. The reclassifications reduced other current assets and other liabilities by   $520   and   $410  , respectively, increased other assets by   $109  , and had an immaterial impact on other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2015. Adoption of this guidance also had an immaterial impact on the total assets by segment as disclosed in Note 11. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by recording deferred debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt the guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. The Company reclassified deferred issuance costs from other assets to the respective debt liability. Adoption of this guidance and prior fiscal year reclassifications had an immaterial impact on previously reported consolidated financial statements and an immaterial impact on the total assets by segment as disclosed in Note 11. 
  In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance that changed the criteria for reporting discontinued operations, as well as requiring new disclosures regarding discontinued operations and disposals that do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after

December 15, 2014. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2016. Adoption did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance converges the requirements for reporting revenue and requires disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from these contracts. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases, which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on stock compensation, which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance will change several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
  The Company is evaluating the impact of these standards on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

              (2) 
    The asset and the liability values are included in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 for additional information on derivative instruments. 
     During and at the end of both   2016   and   2015  , the Company did not hold any Level 3 financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or 2 during   2016   and   2015  . 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include held-to-maturity investments that are carried at amortized cost and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial assets during   2016   and   2015  . See Note 4 for discussion on the fair value of long-term debt. 
  Nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as long-lived assets that are measured at fair value resulting from an impairment, if deemed necessary. There were no fair value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during   2016   and these adjustments were immaterial during   2015  .

  Note 4 Debt (Continued) 

In   2016  , the average and maximum short term borrowings in Japan were   $99   and   $110  , respectively, and had a weighted average interest rate of   0.52%   during the year. All other short term borrowings during the year were immaterial. In   2015  , the average and maximum short term borrowings were immaterial.  
  Long-Term Debt 
  On February 17, 2015, the Company issued   $1,000   in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (February 2015 Notes), as follows:   $500   of   1.75%   Senior Notes due   February 15, 2020  ; and   $500   of   2.25%   Senior Notes due   February 15, 2022  .   Interest is due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15; the first payment was made on August 15, 2015  . The Company, at its option, may redeem the February 2015 Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price is equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. The Company will be required to offer to purchase the February 2015 Notes, at a price of   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the February 2015 Notes. The discount and issuance costs associated with the February 2015 Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes, which are valued using Level 2 inputs. 
  In December 2012, the Company issued   $3,500   in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (December 2012 Notes) as follows:   $1,200   of   0.65%   Senior Notes due   December 7, 2015  ;   $1,100   of   1.125%   Senior Notes due   December 15, 2017  ; and   $1,200   of   1.7%   Senior Notes due   December 15, 2019  .   Interest is payable semi-annually  . The Company, at its option, may redeem the December 2012 Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount of the December 2012 Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the December 2012 Notes at a price of   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the December 2012 Notes. The discount and issuance costs associated with the December 2012 Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the notes. In   December 2015  , the Company paid the outstanding principal balance and interest on the   0.65%   Senior Notes with existing sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The remaining December 2012 Notes are valued using Level 2 inputs. 
  In February 2007, the Company issued   $1,100   of   5.5%   Senior Notes due   March 15, 2017   (2007 Senior Note).   Interest is payable semi-annually  . The Company, at its option, may redeem the 2007 Senior Note at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Note to be redeemed or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Note at a price of   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Note. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Note are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the note. This note is valued using Level 2 inputs. 
  Other long-term debt consisted primarily of promissory notes and term loans issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary.  These notes and term loans are valued primarily using Level 3 inputs. In March 2016, the Company's Japanese subsidiary issued approximately   $103   of   0.63%   Guaranteed Senior Notes through a private placement.   Interest is payable semi-annually  , and principal is due in   March 2026  . Additionally in June 2016, the Company's Japanese subsidiary issued approximately   $93   of   zero percent   Guaranteed Senior Notes through a private placement.   Interest is payable semi-annually  , and principal is due in   June 2021  . Both notes are included in other long-term debt in the table below.

  Note 7 Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) 

RSUs held by employees and non-employee directors are subject to quarterly vesting upon certain terminations of employment or service. Employees who attain certain years of service with the Company receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date rather than upon retirement. The Seventh Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Seventh Plan), amended in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, is the Company s only stock-based compensation plan with shares available for grant at the end of   2016  . Each share issued in respect of stock awards is counted as   1.75   shares toward the limit of shares made available under the Seventh Plan. The Seventh Plan authorized the issuance of   23,500,000   shares (  13,429,000   RSUs) of common stock for future grants in addition to the shares authorized under the previous plan. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares equal to the minimum statutory withholding taxes. 
  As required by the Company's Seventh Plan, in conjunction with the special cash dividend discussed in Note 6, adjustments were made to awards outstanding on the dividend record date to preserve their value following the dividend, as follows: (i) the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased; and (ii) the exercise prices of outstanding stock options were reduced and the number of shares subject to such options was increased. Approximately   410,000   stock options were adjusted, and approximately   8,956,000   RSUs were adjusted. These adjustments did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the outstanding awards did not change. As further required by the Seventh Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the Seventh Plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional   750,000   RSU shares available to be granted. 
  Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity 
  RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over   five   years and   three   years, respectively. Additionally, the terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors who have attained   25   or more years and   five   or more years of service with the Company, respectively, and provide for vesting upon certain terminations of employment or service. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and undelivered shares. At the end of   2016  ,   15,068,000   shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the Seventh Plan. 
  The following awards were outstanding at the end of   2016  : 
             
    7,878,000   time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; 
                
    448,000   performance-based RSUs, of which   236,000   were granted to executive officers subject to the certification of the attainment of specified performance targets for   2016  . This certification occurred in September   2016  , at which time a portion vested as a result of the long service of all executive officers. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. 
     The following table summarizes RSU transactions during   2016  : 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was   $153.46  ,   $125.68  , and   $113.64   in   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs

  Note 8 Income Taxes (Continued) 

The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014   is as follows: 

The Company s provision for income taxes for 2015 was favorably impacted by a   $57   tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend of   $5.00   per share paid by the Company to employees, through shares owned in the Company's 401(k) Retirement Plan. Dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. There was no similar special cash dividend in   2016   and   2014  . 
  The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: 
   
 _______________ 
   The deferred tax accounts at the end of   2016   and   2015   include non-current deferred income tax assets of   $202   and   $219  , respectively, included in other assets; and non-current deferred income tax liabilities of   $297   and   $51  , respectively, included in other liabilities. 
  The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested because its subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of foreign operations when it is determined that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. 
  During 2015, the Company repatriated a portion of the earnings in the Canadian operations that, in 2014, the Company determined were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of the Canadian operations, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. These earnings were distributed in 2016. Current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial U.S. benefit, which was recorded at the end of 2015. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2016, the Company determined that a portion of the undistributed earnings of its Canadian operations could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences. Accordingly, the Company no longer considers that portion to be indefinitely reinvested.  
  The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of   $3,280   and   $2,845   at the end of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries because

  Note 8 Income Taxes (Continued) 

the subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings, if repatriated would not result in an adverse tax consequence. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability that would be associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.  
  The Company believes that its U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet its U.S. liquidity requirements and has no current plans to repatriate for use in the U.S. the cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for   2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of   2016   and   2015  , these amounts were immaterial and   $50  , respectively. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. At the end of 2015, the Company recorded an offsetting long-term asset of   $48  . There was no offsetting long-term asset at the end of 2016.  
  The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is   $46   and   $98   at the end of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized by the Company were not material in   2016   and   2015  . Accrued interest and penalties were not material at the end of   2016   and   2015  . 
  The Company is currently under audit by several taxing jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits we have recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
  The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2013. The Company is currently subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2012 to present and in California for fiscal years 2007 to present. No other examinations are believed to be material.

Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a number of claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters reach a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of this Report, the Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to two matters described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but will continue to monitor the matter for developments that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot in our view be reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties. 
  The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others: 
  Numerous putative class actions have been brought around the United States against motor fuel retailers, including the Company, alleging that they have been overcharging consumers by selling gasoline or diesel that is warmer than 60 degrees without adjusting the volume sold to compensate for heat-related expansion or disclosing the effect of such expansion on the energy equivalent received by the consumer. The Company is named in the following actions: Raphael Sagalyn, et al., v. Chevron USA, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-430 (D. Md.); Phyllis Lerner, et al., v.

America Corp., et al., Case No. 07-1754 (S.D. Cal.). On June 18, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation assigned the action, entitled In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation, MDL Docket No 1840, to Judge Kathryn Vratil in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. On April 12, 2009, the Company agreed to settle the actions in which it is named as a defendant. Under the settlement, which was subject to final approval by the court, the Company agreed, to the extent allowed by law and subject to other terms and conditions in the agreement, to install over five years from the effective date of the settlement temperature-correcting dispensers in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Other than payments to class representatives, the settlement does not provide for cash payments to class members. On September 22, 2011, the court preliminarily approved a revised settlement, which did not materially alter the terms. On April 24, 2012, the court granted final approval of the revised settlement. A class member who objected has filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. Plaintiffs have moved for an award of   $10   in attorneys  fees, as well as an award of costs and payments to class representatives. A report and recommendation has been issued in favor of a fee award of   $3.8  , to which the Company is objecting. On August 24, 2016, the district court affirmed the report and recommendation. On March 20, 2014, the Company filed a notice invoking a  most favored nation  provision under the settlement, under which it seeks to adopt provisions in later settlements with certain other defendants. The motion was denied on January 23, 2015. Final judgment was entered on September 22, 2015, and the Company has filed a notice of appeal. 
  The Company received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. Certain states have separately also made requests for payment by the Company concerning a specific type of property, some of which have been paid in immaterial amounts.  
  The Company has received from the Drug Enforcement Administration subpoenas and administrative inspection warrants concerning the Company's fulfillment of prescriptions related to controlled substances and related practices. Offices of the United States Attorney in various districts have communicated to the Company their belief that the Company has committed civil regulatory violations concerning these subjects.  The Company is seeking to cooperate with these processes and is holding discussions concerning a potential resolution. 
  The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter.

Note 11 Segment Reporting 
  The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan, Australia, and Spain and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. The Company s reportable segments are largely based on management s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1. All material inter-segment net sales and expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, are incurred on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, but are included in the U.S. operations because those costs are not allocated internally and generally come under the responsibility of the Company's U.S. management team.
