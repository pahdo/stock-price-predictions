1. 
     ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
  In the opinion of Titan International, Inc. (Titan or the Company), the accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements contain all adjustments which are normal and recurring in nature and necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Accounting policies have continued without significant change and are described in the Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies contained in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  These interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules for Form 10-Q's and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Sales 
  Sales and revenues are presented net of sales taxes and other related taxes. 
    
  Fair value of financial instruments 
  The Company records all financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, and other accruals at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short term or stated rates.  Investments in marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value.  The   6.875%   senior secured notes due 2020 (senior secured notes) and   5.625%   convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 (convertible notes) are carried at cost of   $395.6 million   and   $60.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The fair value of the senior secured notes at   September 30, 2016  , as obtained through an independent pricing source, was approximately   $380.0 million  . 
    
  Cash dividends 
  The Company declared cash dividends of   $0.005   and   $0.015   per share of common stock for each of the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The   third   quarter 2016 cash dividend of   $0.005   per share of common stock was paid October 14, 2016, to shareholders of record on September 30, 2016. 
    
  Use of estimates 
  The policies utilized by the Company in the preparation of the financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and require management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
    
  Recently issued accounting standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."  This update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Topic 605, Revenue Recognition".  The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This guidance also requires disclosure about the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The amendments in this update were deferred by ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of Effective Date", and are now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  The Company will adopt the guidance in the year beginning on January 1, 2018, and is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

  (Unaudited) 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."  This update amends existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  As a result of adopting this update,   $5 million   of debt issuance cost was reclassified from other long-term assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)."  This update was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, "Simplifying the Transition to Equity Method of Accounting."  This update eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of the increase in the level of ownership.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early application is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  This update involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing."  This ASU clarifies the following aspects of Topic 606:  identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, "Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients."  This ASU affects only narrow aspects of Topic 606 related to:  assessing the collectability criterion; presentation of sales tax; noncash consideration; and contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.  The amendments in these updates affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, and the effective dates are the same as those for ASU No. 2014-09. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."  This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Reclassification 
  Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.  The Company has implemented new technology resources which allow for more accurate segregation of sales and profit by segment.  The previous year segment information has been updated to be consistent.

9.  REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 
    
  The Company has a shareholders  agreement with One Equity Partners (OEP) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which was used for the acquisition of Voltyre-Prom, a leading producer of agricultural and industrial tires in Volgograd, Russia.  The agreement contains a settlement put option which is exercisable July through December of 2018 and may require Titan to purchase the shares of OEP and RDIF, with cash or Titan common stock, at a value set by the agreement.  The value set by the agreement is the greater of:  the aggregate of the investment of the selling party and an amount representing an internal rate of return of 8%; or the last twelve months of EBITDA times 5.5 less net debt times the ownership percentage.  The value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest has been recorded at the aggregate of the investment of the selling party and an amount representing an internal rate of return of 8%, which is currently greater. 
  The redemption features of the settlement put option are not solely within the Company s control and the noncontrolling interest is presented as redeemable noncontrolling interest separately from total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the redemption value of the settlement put option.  If the redemption value is greater than the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest, the increase is adjusted directly to retained earnings of the affected entity, or additional paid-in capital if there are no available retained earnings applicable to the redeemable noncontrolling interest.

15. INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company recorded income tax benefit of   $(2.1) million   and expense of   $0.3 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $2.6 million   and   $3.2 million  .  The Company's effective income tax rate was   16%   and   (1)%   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and   (13%)   and   (10)%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company s 2016 income tax expense and rate differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions that incurred a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets created by current year projected losses.  In addition, the Company adjusted its net uncertain tax positions which resulted in a tax benefit of   $2.5 million  . 
    
  The Company's 2015 income tax expense and rate differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S.  Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of certain foreign jurisdictions that incurred a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets created by current year projected losses and foreign income taxed in the U.S. offset by net discrete benefits related to a U.S. check the box election and tax law enactments. 
    
  The Company continues to monitor the realization of its deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance.  The Company analyzes available positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is needed based on the weight of the evidence.  This objectively verifiable evidence includes profit and loss positions and the Company weighs this analysis to determine if a valuation allowance is needed.  This process requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that are uncertain in nature.  The Company has established valuation allowances on U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and continues to monitor and assess potential valuation allowances in all its jurisdictions. 
    
  The Company is involved in various tax matters, some of which the outcome is uncertain.  The IRS issued a final audit report in August 2016 for the tax years 2010 through 2014 and issued a notice of proposed adjustment for   $6.5 million  . The Company does not agree with certain proposed adjustments and responded by filing a formal protest letter with the IRS Office of Appeals.   As a result of this process, the Company adjusted its uncertain tax positions to properly reflect the effectively settled positions and certain IRS proposed items which are being sent to Appeals. The Company believes that it has adequate tax reserves to address these tax matters acknowledging that the outcome and timing of these events are uncertain.

  Earnings per share (EPS) were as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share data): 

The effect of stock options/trusts has been excluded for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, as the effect would have been antidilutive.  The weighted average share amount excluded was   0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   0.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the weighted average share amount excluded was   0.2 million  . 
    
  The effect of convertible notes has been excluded for the three months and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as the effect would have been antidilutive.  The weighted average share amount excluded for convertible notes totaled   5.6 million   shares for the three months and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

17.  LITIGATION 
    
  The Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes at this time that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  However, due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with or its liabilities pertaining to legal judgments.

19.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Accounting standards for fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers are defined as: 
    
  Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. 
  Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable. 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):

TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

OVERVIEW 
  Titan International, Inc. and its subsidiaries are leading manufacturers of wheels, tires, wheel and tire assemblies, and undercarriage systems and components for off-highway vehicles used in the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer segments.  Titan manufactures both wheels and tires for the majority of these market applications, allowing the Company to provide the value-added service of delivering complete wheel and tire assemblies.  The Company offers a broad range of products that are manufactured in relatively short production runs to meet the specifications of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and/or the requirements of aftermarket customers. 
    
  Agricultural Segment:    Titan's agricultural rims, wheels, tires and undercarriage systems and components are manufactured for use on various agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, skidders, plows, planters and irrigation equipment, and are sold directly to OEMs and to the aftermarket through independent distributors, equipment dealers and Titan's own distribution centers. 
    
  Earthmoving/Construction Segment:    The Company manufactures rims, wheels, tires and undercarriage systems and components for various types of off-the-road (OTR) earthmoving, mining, military, construction and forestry equipment, including skid steers, aerial lifts, cranes, graders and levelers, scrapers, self-propelled shovel loaders, articulated dump trucks, load transporters, haul trucks, backhoe loaders, crawler tractors, lattice cranes, shovels, and hydraulic excavators. 
    
  Consumer Segment:    Titan manufactures bias truck tires in Latin America and light truck tires in Russia.  Titan also offers select products for ATVs, turf, and golf cart applications. 
    
  The Company s major OEM customers include large manufacturers of off-highway equipment such as AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., CNH Global N.V., Deere   Company, and Kubota Corporation, in addition to many other off-highway equipment manufacturers.  The Company distributes products to OEMs, independent and OEM-affiliated dealers, and through a network of distribution facilities. 
    
  The table provides highlights for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   2015   (amounts in thousands, except earnings per share): 

Quarter  :  The Company recorded sales of   $306.2 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , which were   1%   lower than the   third   quarter   2015   sales of   $308.8 million  .  The slight decrease in sales was driven by changes in price/mix.  Sales volume was slightly higher in the earthmoving/construction segment offset by lower volumes in both the agricultural and consumer segments, with currency translation having virtually no effect. 
    
  The Company's gross profit was   $33.0 million  , or   10.8%   of net sales, for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $26.2 million  , or   8.5%   of net sales, in   2015  .  Loss from operations was   $8.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to loss of   $14.5 million   in   2015  .  Net loss was   $10.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to loss of   $37.6 million   in   2015  .   Basic earnings per share was   $(0.21)   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $(0.79)   in   2015  .   
    
  Year-to-date  :  The Company recorded sales of   $958.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which were   12%   lower than   2015   sales of   $1,087.0 million  .  Overall sales experienced reductions in volume of 5% and price/mix of 4% as the agricultural and consumer segments continue to see lower volume sales compared to prior year.  Unfavorable currency translation affected sales by 3%.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company's gross profit was   $109.9 million  , or   11.5%   of net sales, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $120.0 million  , or   11.0%   of net sales, in   2015  .  Loss from operations was   $12.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to loss of   $6.1 million   in   2015  .  Net loss was   $22.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to loss of   $34.4 million   in   2015  .   Basic earnings per share was   $(0.55)   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $(0.67)   in   2015  .   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates.  The Company s application of these policies involves assumptions that require difficult subjective judgments regarding many factors, which, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures.  A future change in the estimates, assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  Asset and Business Acquisitions 
  The allocation of purchase price for asset and business acquisitions requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired assets and/or business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocations.  If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in determining the purchase price allocations, impairment losses could occur.  To aid in establishing the value of any intangible assets at the time of acquisition, the Company typically engages a professional appraisal firm. 
    
  Inventories 
  Inventories are valued at lower of cost or market.  Market value is estimated based on current selling prices.  The majority of steel material inventory in North America is accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  The remaining inventories were valued under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or average cost method.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   7%   of the Company's inventories were valued under the LIFO method.  Estimated provisions are established for slow-moving and obsolete inventory. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
  The Company reviews fixed assets to assess recoverability from future operations whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.  Factors that could result in an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses, current cash flows that may be insufficient to recover the investment in the property over the remaining useful life, or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or significant changes in business strategies.  Impairment losses are recognized in operating results when expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset.  Impairment losses are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the discounted expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the asset. 
    
  As a result of the continued downturns in the Company's markets and overall operating loss, the Company determined in the fourth quarter of 2015 that events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of fixed assets may not be recoverable.  As a result of continued downturns in the Company's markets and operating loss, the Company determined in the second quarter of 2016 that events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of fixed assets at the Bryan, Ohio, location may not be recoverable.  Certain long-lived assets were reviewed for recoverability in both periods.  No impairment was identified in either period.  During the third quarter of 2016, there were no events and circumstances indicating that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.  The Company's impairment testing includes uncertainty because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimated future cash flows and asset fair values.  If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, Titan may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, which could be material to the Company's results of operations.

TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Income Taxes 
  Deferred income tax provisions are determined using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.   The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset positions and recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards for income taxes. 
    
  Retirement Benefit Obligations 
  Pension benefit obligations are based on various assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating these amounts.  These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors.  Revisions in assumptions and actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses, cash funding requirements and obligations.  The Company has three frozen defined benefit pension plans in the United States and pension plans in several foreign countries.  During the first quarter of   2016  , the Company contributed cash funds of   $2.9 million   to its pension plans.  Titan expects to contribute approximately   $0.8 million   to these pension plans during the remainder of   2016  .  For more information concerning these costs and obligations, see the discussion of the  Pensions  and Note 26 to the Company's financial statements on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Product Warranties 
  The Company provides limited warranties on workmanship of its products in all market segments.  The majority of the Company's products have a limited warranty that ranges from zero to ten years, with certain products being prorated after the first year.  The Company calculates a provision for warranty expense based on past warranty experience.  Actual warranty expense may differ from historical experience.  The Company's warranty accrual was   $19.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $23.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company's warranty accrual amount decreased as the result of lower sales and a decrease in warranty experience resulting from efforts to increase quality. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Highlights for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Net Sales 
  Quarter:    Net sales for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $306.2 million  , compared to   $308.8 million   in   2015  , a decrease of   1%  .  The slight decrease in sales was driven by changes in price/mix.  Sales volume was slightly higher in the earthmoving/construction segment offset by lower volumes in both the agricultural and consumer segments, with currency translation having virtually no effect. 
    
  Year-to-date:    Net sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were   $958.2 million  , compared to   $1,087.0 million   in   2015  , a decrease of   12%  .  Overall sales experienced reductions in volume of 5% and price/mix of 4% as the agricultural and consumer segments continue to see lower volume sales compared to prior year.  Unfavorable currency translation affected sales by 3%. 
    
  Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
  Quarter:    Cost of sales was   $273.2 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $282.7 million   in   2015  .  Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $33.0 million  , or   10.8%   of net sales, compared to   $26.2 million  , or   8.5%   of net sales for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Despite the continued economic stress on business, gross profit margins increased as there is a continued focus on improving production efficiency, rationalizing expenditures, finding lower cost material, improving quality, and optimizing prices.

TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Foreign currency gain/loss in the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015   primarily reflects the translation of intercompany loans at certain foreign subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.  Since such loans are expected to be settled in cash at some point in the future, these loans are adjusted each reporting period to reflect the current exchange rates.  
    
  Other Income 
  Other income was   $3.6 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $0.8 million   in   2015  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded Wheels India Limited equity income of   $0.8 million  , interest income of   $0.9 million  , rental income of   $0.6 million  , and a gain related to contractual obligation investments of   $0.6 million  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a loss related to contractual obligation investments of   $1.0 million  , interest income of   $0.5 million  , and Wheels India Limited equity income of   $0.5 million  . 
    
  Other income was   $10.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $6.3 million   in   2015  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded Wheels India Limited equity income of   $2.4 million  , a gain on the sale of assets of   $2.3 million  , interest income of   $2.2 million  , rental income of   $1.5 million  , and discount amortization on prepaid royalty of   $1.2 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded interest income of   $2.0 million  , discount amortization on prepaid royalty of   $1.5 million  , and Wheels India Limited equity income of   $1.4 million  . 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The Company recorded income tax benefit of   $(2.1) million   and income tax expense of   $0.3 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $2.6 million   and   $3.2 million  .  The Company's effective income tax rate was   16%   and   (1)%   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   (13)%   and   (10)%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company s 2016 income tax expense and rate differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions that incurred a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets created by current year projected losses.  In addition, the Company adjusted its net uncertain tax positions which resulted in a tax benefit of $2.5 million. 
    
  The Company's 2015 income tax expense and rate differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pre-tax income primarily as a result of certain foreign jurisdictions that incurred a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets created by current year projected losses and foreign income taxed in the U.S. offset by net discrete benefits related to a U.S. check the box election and tax law enactments. 
    
  The Company continues to monitor the realization of its deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance.  The Company analyzes available positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is needed based on the weight of the evidence.  This objectively verifiable evidence includes profit and loss positions and the Company weighs this analysis to determine if a valuation allowance is needed.  This process requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that are uncertain in nature.  The Company has established valuation allowances on U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions and continues to monitor and assess potential valuation allowances in all its jurisdictions. 
    
  The Company is involved in various tax matters, some of which the outcome is uncertain.  The IRS issued a final audit report in August 2016 for the tax years 2010 through 2014 and issued a notice of proposed adjustment for $6.5 million. The Company does not agree with certain proposed adjustments and responded by filing a formal protest letter with the IRS Office of Appeals.   As a result of this process, the Company adjusted its uncertain tax positions to properly reflect the effectively settled positions and certain IRS proposed items which are being sent to Appeals.  The Company believes that it has adequate tax reserves to address these tax matters acknowledging that the outcome and timing of these events are uncertain. 
    
  Net Loss

34 

TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company's recorded liability for pensions is based on a number of assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on investments, mortality rates and other factors.  Certain of these assumptions are determined by the Company with the assistance of outside actuaries.  Assumptions are based on past experience and anticipated future trends.  These assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and revised when appropriate.  Revisions in assumptions and actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses, cash funding requirements and the carrying value of the related obligations.  Titan expects to contribute approximately   $0.8 million   to these pension plans during the remainder of 2016. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash Flows 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $215.5 million   of cash. 

The cash balance increased by   $15.3 million   from   December 31, 2015  , due to the following items: 
    
  Operating Cash Flows 
  Summary of cash flows from operating activities: 

In the first nine months of   2016  , operating activities provided   $54.0 million   of cash, including increases in accounts payable of   $21.3 million  .

The net loss in the first nine months of   2016   was a   $12.3 million   increase from the loss in the first nine months of   2015  .  When comparing the first nine months of   2016   to the first nine months of   2015  , cash flows from all operating activities contributed to the change in cash provided by operating activities. 
    
  The Company's inventory balance was higher at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   December 31, 2015  .  Days sales in inventory increased to 93 days at   September 30, 2016  , from 77 days at   December 31, 2015  , driven from a strategic increase in select inventories related to mining aftermarket sales initiatives.

Net cash used for investing activities was   $29.2 million   in the first nine months of   2016  , as compared to   $30.9 million   in the first nine months of   2015  .  The Company invested a total of   $30.8 million   in capital expenditures in the first nine months of   2016  , compared to   $35.2 million   in   2015  .  The   2016   and   2015   expenditures represent various equipment purchases and improvements to enhance production capabilities of Titan's existing business and maintaining existing equipment.  
    
  Financing Cash Flows 
  Summary of cash flows from financing activities: 

In the first nine months of   2016  ,   $12.5 million   of cash was used for financing activities.  This cash was primarily used on payment of debt of   $14.0 million  . 
       
  In the first nine months of   2015  ,   $1.8 million   of cash was provided by financing activities.  This cash was primarily provided by proceeds from borrowings of   $14.6 million   offset by payment on debt of   $11.4 million  . 
    
  Financing cash flows decreased by   $14.2 million   when comparing the first nine months of   2016   to the first nine months of   2015  .  This decrease was primarily attributable to decrease in borrowings. 
    
  Debt Restrictions 
  The Company s revolving credit facility (credit facility) contains various restrictions, including: 
             
    Limits on dividends and repurchases of the Company s stock 
                
    Restrictions on the ability of the Company to make additional borrowings, or to consolidate, merge or otherwise fundamentally change the ownership of the Company 
                
    Limitations on investments, dispositions of assets and guarantees of indebtedness 
                
    Other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
        
  These restrictions could limit the Company s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. 
    
  Other Issues 
  The Company s business is subject to seasonal variations in sales that affect inventory levels and accounts receivable balances.  Historically, Titan tends to have higher production levels in the first and second quarters.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Liquidity Outlook 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $215.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on the Company's $150 million credit facility.  Titan's availability under this domestic facility may be less than   $150 million   as a result of outstanding letters of credit and eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances at certain domestic subsidiaries.  At   September 30, 2016  , an outstanding letter of credit totaled   $11.6 million   and the amount available under the facility totaled   $43.4 million  , based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances.  The cash and cash equivalents balance of   $215.5 million   includes   $70.3 million   held in foreign countries.  The Company's current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund U.S. operations.  However, if foreign funds were needed for U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate the funds.  The Company does have U.S. net operating losses that may be available to offset a portion of the potential cash tax outlay from the repatriation of these foreign funds. 
    
  Capital expenditures for the remainder of   2016   are estimated to be approximately $3 million to $5 million.  Cash payments for interest are currently forecasted to be approximately $15 million for the remainder of   2016   based on   September 30, 2016   debt balances.  The forecasted interest payments are comprised primarily of the semi-annual payment of $13.8 million (paid October 1) for the 6.875% senior secured notes.  
    
  The Company's convertible notes, of which $60.2 million are outstanding, are due January 2017 and have been reclassified to short-term debt. 
    
  The Company has commenced renewal discussions involving its revolving credit facility and currently anticipates completion of the renewal by early 2017 in advance of the December 2017 termination. 
    
  The Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest includes a settlement put option which is exercisable July through December of 2018.  If exercised in July 2018, the redeemable noncontrolling interest may be purchased, with cash or Titan common stock, at an amount set by the agreement which is currently estimated to be approximately $117 million at that time.  See note 9 to the Company's consolidated condensed financial statements. 
    
  In the future, Titan may seek to grow by making acquisitions which will depend on the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and to finance those acquisitions. 
    
  Subject to the terms of indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash on hand, cash from operations, additional indebtedness, issuing additional equity securities and divestitures. 
    
  Cash on hand, anticipated internal cash flows from operations and utilization of remaining available borrowings are expected to provide sufficient liquidity for working capital needs, debt maturities, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.  
    
  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."  This update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in "Topic 605, Revenue Recognition".  The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This guidance also requires disclosure about the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The amendments in this update were deferred by ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of Effective Date", and are now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  The Company will adopt the guidance in the year beginning on January 1, 2018, and is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."  This update amends existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  As a result of adopting this update, $5.0 million of debt issuance cost was reclassified from other long-term assets to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.

This update was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, "Simplifying the Transition to Equity Method of Accounting."  This update eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of the increase in the level of ownership.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early application is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  This update involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing."  This ASU clarifies the following aspects of Topic 606:  identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, "Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients."  This ASU affects only narrow aspects of Topic 606 related to:  assessing the collectability criterion; presentation of sales tax; noncash consideration; and contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.  The amendments in these updates affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, and the effective dates are the same as those for ASU No. 2014-09. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."  This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 
  In the first three quarters of 2016, Titan experienced lower sales when compared to the same periods of 2015.  The lower sales levels were primarily the result of decreased demand for new equipment used in the agricultural market, which remains in a cyclical downturn, and unfavorable currency translation.  In addition, competitive pressures and lower raw material prices, passed to customers in some instances, negatively impacted sales. 
    
  Energy, raw material and petroleum-based product costs have been volatile and may affect the Company s margins.  Many of Titan s overhead expenses are fixed; therefore, lower seasonal trends may cause negative fluctuations in quarterly profit margins and affect the financial condition of the Company. 
    
  AGRICULTURAL MARKET OUTLOOK 
  Agricultural market sales were lower in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the first three quarters of 2015 due to decreased demand for new equipment used in the agricultural market.  Farm net income is generally expected to decline moderately through 2016 based upon lower forecasted cash receipts offset somewhat by lower production costs (fuel, oil, chemical, feed, etc.).  Lower income levels are putting pressure on the demand for large farm equipment.  More specifically, large equipment sales are expected to continue to decline through 2016.  The mix shift to lower horsepower tractors has a negative impact on revenue and margin performance.  Most major OEMs are forecasting 2016 equipment sales to be below 2015 within most regions.  North American used equipment levels remain relatively high with some decreases recently from peak levels.  Excess used equipment inventory and also used equipment values can negatively impact the new equipment market.  Many variables, including weather, grain prices, export markets, currency and government policies and subsidies can greatly influence the overall health of the agricultural economy.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of  
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EARTHMOVING/CONSTRUCTION MARKET OUTLOOK 
  Earthmoving/construction market sales were lower in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the first three quarters of 2015 due to unfavorable price/mix and currency translation.  Demand for larger products used in the mining industry is expected to remain depressed throughout 2016, with demand for our products in this market expected to remain similar to 2015.  Demand for small and medium sized earthmoving/construction equipment used in the housing and commercial construction sectors has improved during 2016 and is expected to be linked to overall economic growth.  The earthmoving/construction segment is affected by many variables, including commodity prices, road construction, infrastructure, government appropriations, housing starts and other macroeconomic drivers. 
    
  CONSUMER MARKET OUTLOOK 
  Consumer market sales were lower in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared to the first three quarters of 2015.  Sales in the consumer market decreased primarily as the result of unfavorable currency translation and price/mix from competitive pressures.  The consumer market is expected to remain highly competitive throughout 2016.  Economic uncertainty in Brazil has affected and may continue to affect the Company's consumer sales.  The consumer segment is affected by many variables including consumer spending, interest rates, government policies and other macroeconomic drivers. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  See the Company's 2015 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K (Item 7A).  There has been no material change in this information. 
    
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Titan management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the period covered by this Form 10-Q and concluded that, because of a material weakness in Titan's internal control over financial reporting of the Company s entity level controls described below, disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Notwithstanding the material weakness described below, the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the consolidated condensed financial statements included in the Quarterly Report and in this Form 10-Q are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for each of the periods presented herein. 
    
  Previously Disclosed Material Weakness   
  Management previously reported a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Based on this evaluation, including consideration of the control deficiencies discussed below, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015, due to the fact that there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.  Specifically, through assessment and evaluation, as discussed above, management identified the following points amplified the potential for deficiency: (i) rapid global growth, (ii) increased complexity in accounting and reporting infrastructure and (iii) economic and market downturn.  The material weakness was previously identified and reported in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and is further defined below. 
    
  Titan has experienced significant business changes over the past three years, including rapid global growth from a U.S. based company to a large, multinational organization, operating in more than 16 countries, resulting in unique and discrete complex accounting matters.  This growth has introduced a significant increase in the complexity of Titan s accounting and reporting infrastructure for collecting and analyzing financial information.  Additionally, Titan has been experiencing an economic and market downturn, adding to the complexity of assessing goodwill and fixed asset impairments, valuation of inventory and other complex accounting transactions from a global perspective.  Titan s current accounting and reporting infrastructure does not possess the proper resources, processes and systems to effectively address the complex accounting transactions, resulting from its recent international growth and economic/market decline.

TITAN INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

Remediation Plan 
  Management has been actively engaged in developing and implementing remediation plans to address the above control deficiencies. The remediation efforts are in process and include the following: 

People - enhance Titan's current accounting and reporting infrastructure by augmenting the team with professionals who possess the commensurate accounting skill sets. 
                
    Processes - strengthen Titan's current control environment and overall business processes to ensure risk mitigation and materially accurate financial statement reporting, including increased levels of management review and updated financial policies. 
                
    Systems - augment Titan's current system infrastructure to ensure accurate, timely data is reported. 
       
  Management developed a detailed plan and timetable for implementing the foregoing remediation efforts.  As a part of the detailed plan, the Company implemented the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission during the second quarter of 2016, along with several new policies.  This sets the stage for testing of the internal controls over financial reporting that commenced in the third quarter and will continue into the fourth quarter and at year-end.  
    
  Management believes the aforementioned efforts will effectively remediate the material weakness.  As the Company continues evaluating and improving internal control over financial reporting, Titan may determine additional measures are necessary to address control deficiencies and will modify the remediation plan described above, as required. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  Other than the remediation steps described above, there were no material changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the third quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluations of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes at this time that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  However, due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with or its liabilities pertaining to legal judgments. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  See the Company's 2015 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K (Item 1A) filed on February 25, 2016.  There has been no material change in this information.
