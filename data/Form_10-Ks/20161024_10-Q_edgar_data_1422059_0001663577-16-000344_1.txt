1   NATURE OF BUSINESS   

Nature
of Business   

Lans
Holdings is in the business of providing secure payment and communication solutions. The Company s aim is to make it easier
for sellers to start selling, and buyers to buy with confidence. The Company intends that its solutions will be used to enable
businesses to process payments more efficiently whether online or in a retail store front. The Company intends to offer white
label solutions for payment service providers to enable business to consumer and business to business payments through physical
POS, mobile devices, online and software integrations. The Company also intends to provide business processing outsourcing through
its Fractional I.T. Services, and complaint ready hosted solutions through its Infrastructure on Demand.  

Lans
Holdings is focused to provide emerging payment  breakthrough  technology that motivates and rewards clients for adopting
more secure infrastructure to support their businesses.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company has incurred losses since inception and has negative working capital. These factors create substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable
operations.  

Management s
plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and ongoing operations;
however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

These
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States and are expressed in US dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is November 30.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position
and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which
would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end
November 30, 2015 have been omitted.  

Table of Contents     

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates
and assumptions related to long-lived assets, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates
and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and
the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company
may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the
estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
amounts due to officers, notes payable and convertible debentures. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates
fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed
in these financial statements.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less be cash equivalents.  

Intangible
Assets   

Software,
licenses and other rights have been capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  
Internal-Use Software.  Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.  

If
the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized
for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and
are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance
against deferred tax assets is recognized, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized.  

Any
deferred tax asset is considered immaterial and has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because at this time Company believes
that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefit will not be realized as the Company has no current operations.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company derives revenue from subscriptions for software that provide secure payment solutions, from the provision of customized
development services and from the provision of secure on demand infrastructure.  

The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are fully delivered and services have been
provided, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  

All
of the Company s revenues during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 resulted from four customers.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

The
Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Based Compensation ,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards
made to employees and directors, including stock options.  

ASC
718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as its method of determining fair value. This model is affected by the Company s
stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not
limited to the Company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee
stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an
expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.  

Options
granted to consultants are valued at the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or the fair value of the services received,
whichever is more reliably measureable.  

Loss
Per Common Share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to
be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect
is anti-dilutive. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had 5,116,421 (2015   nil) dilutive potential shares outstanding.  

Subsequent
Events   

The
Company has evaluated all transactions through the date the financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial
Statements - Going Concern . The Update provides US GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether
there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures.
For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are
issued. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-15 on its financial statements.

embedded conversion options of the Company s convertible debentures described in Note 4 contain conversion features that
are accounted for as derivative liabilities. The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end of every reporting
period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial
instruments.  

  The
Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the derivative liabilities and embedded conversion option liabilities
as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on various assumptions. The model incorporates
the price of a share of the Company s common stock (as quoted on NASDAQ), volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and
estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value
measurement. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations:  

The
fair value of the derivative liabilities were $89,280 and $nil at August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively:

Company
Overview   

We
are in the business of providing secure payment and communication solutions. Our aim is to make it easier for sellers to sell,
and buyers to buy with confidence. Our solutions are intended to enable businesses to process payments more efficiently whether
online or in a retail store front. We intend to offer white label solutions for payment service providers to enable business to
consumer and business to business payments through physical POS, mobile devices, online and software integrations.  

We
also provide business processing outsourcing through our Fractional I.T. services, and complaint ready hosted solutions through
our Infrastructure on Demand.  

We
have only generated a small amount of revenue from our payment processor business and from our solutions outsourcing business.
In order to implement our business plan, we will need to raise additional capital. We estimate that we will need approximately
$375,000 in the next twelve months. These funds will be used to cover our debt obligations, overhead, consulting fees, marketing
expenses and IP development, along with our general working capital needs. If we are unable to raise money, we will not be able
to able to service our existing and prospective customers.  

Results
of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015   

We
generated $129,070 in revenues during the three months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with no revenues for three months ended
August 31, 2015. We generated $212,832 in revenues during the nine months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with no revenues
for nine months ended August 31, 2015. All of our revenues in 2016 resulted from four customers. We expect that our client base
will expand and provide more revenues for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, provided we receive adequate financing.  

Our
cost of revenues was $79,860 resulting in gross profit of $49,210 for the three months ended August 31, 2016. Our cost of revenues
was $134,980 resulting in gross profit of $77,852 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016.  

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $230,434 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared with operating expenses
of $160,306 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. Our operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 mainly
consisted of $110,717 in stock-based compensation, $54,860 in  

Table of Contents     

development
costs and $40,500 in consulting fees. Our operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2015 consisted mainly of $108,251
in consulting fees, $19,200 in development fees and $11,345 in professional fees.  

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $480,152 for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, compared with operating expenses
of $2,357,718 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 mainly
consisted of $135,670 in development costs, $124,074 in consulting fees, $120,425 in stock-based compensation and $45,128 in professional
fees. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended August 31, 2015 consisted mainly of a $2,150,000 impairment of our license
agreement with TDUSA along with $113,901 in consulting fees.  

We
anticipate our operating expenses will increase as we undertake our plan of operations. The increase will be attributable to undertaking
development of our payment processor and IT businesses and the professional fees associating with being a reporting company under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

We
incurred other expenses of $25,933 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with $1,965 for the three months ended
August 31, 2015. Our other expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 consisted of $11,998 in interest expense, $10,431

August 31, 2016, as compared with a net loss in the amount of $2,360,638 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Our losses
for each period are attributable to operating expenses together with a lack of significant revenues.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of August 31, 2016, we had $55,071 in current assets consisting of cash, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. Our total
current liabilities as of August 31, 2016 were $871,191. As a result, we have a working capital deficit of $816,120 as of
August 31, 2016.  

Operating
activities used $103,077 in cash for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with $62,510 used for the nine months
ended August 31, 2015. Our negative operating cash flow in 2016 was mainly the result of our net loss of $458,178, offset by changes
in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $164,783, stock-based compensation of $120,425 and accounts payable and accrued expenses
  related parties of $73,298. We primarily relied on cash from loans to fund our operations during the nine months ended
August 31, 2016.  

Investing
activities used $0 in cash for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with $50,000 used for the nine months ended
$50,000, related to the purchase of intangible assets.  

Financing activities provided $87,991 in cash
for the nine months ended August 31, 2016, as compared with $128,887 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Our positive financing
cash flow in 2016 was a result of proceeds from convertible debentures and proceeds from related party notes, offset by payments
on related party notes. 

On June 2, 2016, we received an advance of
$2,000 from our President. The balance was paid off in June 2016. 

On
June 15, 2016, we issued a convertible debenture for $10,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the note is unsecured, bears
interest at 8% per year, and is due on December 31, 2016. At the maturity date, the unpaid amount of principal can be converted
at the holder s option at a price of 50% of the ask price at the date of conversion.  

On
June 30, 2016, we issued a convertible debenture for $2,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the note is unsecured, bears

On
July 12, 2016, we issued a convertible debenture for $30,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the note is unsecured, bears
interest at 8% per year, and is due on December 31, 2016. At the maturity date, the unpaid amount of principal can be converted
at the holder s option at a price of 50% of the ask price at the date of conversion.  

On
July 28, 2016, we issued a convertible debenture for $4,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the note is unsecured, bears
interest at 8% per year, and is due six months from the date of issuance. At the maturity date, the unpaid amount of principal
can be converted at the holder s option at a price of 50% of the ask price at the date of conversion.  

We
received some small loans in the first nine months of 2016, but we will need approximately $375,000 in financing to implement
our business plan. Thus, the success of our business plan beyond the next 12 months is contingent upon us obtaining additional
financing. We intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our
capital expenditures, working capital, or other cash requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the
sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will
be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

As
of August 31, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Going
Concern   

We
have negative working capital and have not yet received significant revenues from sales of our products and services. These factors
have caused our accountants to express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our generating cash from the sale of our common stock and/or obtaining
debt financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management s plans include selling our equity securities and
obtaining debt financing to fund our capital requirement and ongoing operations; however, there can be no assurance we will be
successful in these efforts.

December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our accounting policies are discussed in the footnotes to our financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended November 30, 2015, however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition,
stock-based compensation and intangible assets.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial
Statements - Going Concern . The Update provides US GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether
there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures.
For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are
issued. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-15 on its financial statements.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of August 31, 2016.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
Company plans to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting.  During
the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have hired a CFO, which we believe provides better segregation of
duties and additional staff to monitor our disclosures, but we have otherwise been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified
above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending November 30, 2016:
(i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii)
adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out are largely
dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful
in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended August 31, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
