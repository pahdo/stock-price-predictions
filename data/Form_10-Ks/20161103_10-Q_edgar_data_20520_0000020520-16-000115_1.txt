NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

(1)     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  : 

(a)     Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates  : 

Frontier Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as  we,   us,   our,   Frontier,  or the  Company  in this report. Our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary, in the opinion of Frontier s management, to present fairly the results for the interim periods shown. Revenues, net loss and cash flows for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. For our interim financial statements as of and for the period ended   September   30, 2016, we evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date that we filed this Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   

Effective April 1, 2016, Frontier s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially as a result of the completion of the Verizon Acquisition, as described in Note 3   Acquisitions. Historical financial data presented for Frontier is not indicative of the future financial position or operating results for Frontier, and includes the results of the CTF Operations, as defined in Note 3   Acquisitions, from the date of acquisition on April 1, 2016.  

The preparation of our interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and (iii) the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, asset impairments, indefinite-lived intangibles, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, business combinations, and pension and other postretirement benefits, among others. 

We operate in   one   reportable segment. Frontier provides both regulated and unregulated voice, data and video services to residential, business and wholesale customers and is typically the incumbent voice services provider in its service areas.   We have utilized the aggregation criteria to combine our   seven   regional operating segments because all of these regional operations share similar characteristics, in that they provide the same products and services to similar customers using comparable technologies in all of the states in which we operate. The regulatory structure is generally similar. Differences in the regulatory regime of a particular state do not significantly impact the economic characteristics or operating results of a particular region. 

(b)     Revenue Recognition  : 

Revenue is recognized when services are provided or when products are delivered to customers. Revenue that is billed in advance includes monthly recurring network access services (including data services), special access services and monthly recurring voice, video and related charges. The unearned portion of these fees is initially deferred as a component of  Advanced billings  on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are provided. Revenue that is billed in arrears includes non-recurring network access services (including data services), switched access services and non-recurring voice and video services. The earned but unbilled portion of these fees is recognized as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and accrued in  Accounts receivable  on our consolidated balance sheet in the period that the services are provided. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability when billed. Installation fees and their related direct and incremental costs are initially deferred and recognized as revenue and expense over the average term of a customer relationship. We recognize as current period expense the portion of installation costs that exceeds installation fee revenue.  

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on   an   estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivables.  At September 30, 2016, our accounts receivable balances  , including balances for delinquent accounts,   were higher as a result of planned delays in   collection efforts for new retail customers acquired in the Verizon Transaction. These delays   are customary for us after large acquisitions   in order   to allow for resolution of any service or billing issues for new customers.   Our bad debt expense for this group of customers was $20 million higher   during the three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016  .    Frontier believes that it is adequately reserved, although   actual collections experience may differ materially from our estimates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

Frontier collects various taxes from its customers and subsequently remits these taxes to governmental authorities. Substantially all of these taxes are recorded through the consolidated balance sheet and presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of operations. We also collect Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharges from customers (primarily federal USF) that we have recorded on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and included within  Revenue  and  Network related expenses  of   $  60   million and   $3  8   million, and   $  161   million and   $  114   million for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  . 

In 2015 we accepted the FCC s Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II offer of support, which is a successor to and augments the USF frozen high cost support that we had been receiving pursuant to a 2011 FCC order.    Upon completion of the Verizon Acquisition, Frontier assumed the CAF Phase II support and related obligations that Verizon had previously accepted with regard to California and Texas.    CAF Phase II funding is a program intended to subsidize the high cost of establishing and delivering communications services to certain unserved or underserved areas.  We are recognizing these subsidies into revenue   on a straight line basis, which is   consistent with how the costs related to these subsidies are being and are expected to be incurred. CAF Phase II is a multi-year program which requires us to deploy broadband to a specified number of households in each of the states where funding was accepted. Failure to meet our deployment obligations at the end of the program in 2020 will result in a return of a portion of the funding received. We regularly evaluate our ability to meet our broadband deployment obligations and adjust revenue accordingly. 

We categorize our products, services and other revenues among the following   five   categories: 

Voice services   include traditional local and long distance wireline services, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as a number of unified messaging services offered to our residential and business customers. Voice services also include the long distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our business customers and other carriers;     

Data and Internet services   include broadband services for residential and business customers. We provide data transmission services to high volume business customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits ( nonswitched access ) including services to wireless providers ( wireless backhaul );     

Video services   include revenues generated from services provided directly to residential customers through the FiOS        video and Vantage     video   brands, and through DISH      satellite TV services  ;     

Other   customer revenue includes     sales of customer premise equipment to our business customers and directory services  , less our provision for bad debts  ; and     

Switched Access and Subsidy   revenues include revenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long distance voice traffic ( switched access ). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost subsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund.

The following table provides a summary of revenues from external customers by the categories of Frontier s products and services: 

(c)       Goodwill and Other Intangibles  : 

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired. We undertake studies to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and allocate purchase prices to assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other identifiable intangibles. We examine the carrying value of our goodwill and trade name annually as of December 31, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant, to determine whether there are any impairment losses. We test for goodwill impairment at the  operating segment  level, as that term is defined in GAAP  .    During the   second   quarter of 2016, Frontier reorganized into   seven   regional operating segments, which are aggregated into   one   reportable segment.  In conjunction with the reorganization of our operating segments effective with the   second   quarter of 2016, we reassigned goodwill to our regional operating segments (reporting units) using a relative fair value allocation approach.  We tested for the impairment of goodwill and there was no indication of impairment at   June   30, 2016. 

Frontier amortizes finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on the accelerated method of sum of the years digits. We review such intangible assets at least annually as of December 31 to assess whether any potential impairment exists and whether factors exist that would necessitate a change in useful life and a different amortization period.       

(2)     Recent Accounting Literature  : 

Revenue Recognition 

In May 2014, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  )   issued   Accounting Standards Update (  ASU  )   No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.      This standard  , along with its related amendments,   requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies are also permitted to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date that was for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies are permitted to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. Frontier is currently evaluating the   adoption of   the new standard   to determine the impact that it will have on Frontier s processes, systems and internal controls  , but has not yet selected a transition method or determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.      

Employee Benefit Plans  

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12,  Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965) : There are three parts to the ASU that aim to simplify the accounting and presentation of plan accounting. Part I of this ASU requires fully benefit-responsive investment contracts to be measured at contract value instead of the current fair value measurement. Part II of this ASU requires investments (both participant-directed and nonparticipant-directed investments) of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments in multiple ways. Part

PART I.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) 

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

III of this ASU provides a similar measurement date practical expedient for employee benefit plans as available in ASU No. 2015-04,  Compensation   Retirement Benefits (Topic 715),  which allows employers to measure defined benefit plan assets on a month-end date that is nearest to the year s fiscal year-end when the fiscal period does not coincide with a month-end. Parts I and II of the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. Part III of the new guidance should be applied on a prospective basis.   Th  e   adoption of ASU   2015-12 will impact certain of the disclosures related to our pension plan assets, but otherwise is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016   02,  Leases (Topic 842).    This standard establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases.   Upon implementation, l  essees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded in a contract to avoid misstating the lessee s balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors.   The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 201  8  ,    including interim periods within those fiscal years.   Early   application is permitted  .    Frontier is currently evaluating the impact of     adopting the new standard, but has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

Compensation   Stock Compensation 

In   March   2016   the FASB issued ASU     No.     2016-09  ,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  to amend ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.    The   ASU   is part of the FASB s ongoing simplification initiative, which is designed to reduce cost and complexity while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements. The proposed simplifications address a variety of areas for public entities, including the following: 1) accounting for income taxes, 2) classification of excess tax benefits on the   statement of cash flows, 3) forfeitures, 4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, 5) classifications of employee   taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes, and 6) classification of awards with repurchase features.   The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December   15, 2016, including interim   periods within those fiscal years.   Frontier is currently evaluating the impact of     adopting the new standard, but has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 

In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU provide guidance on the following cash flow issues: 1) debt prepayme  nt or debt extinguishment costs;   2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments  ;   3) contingent consideration payments made after   a    business combination  ;   4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims  ;   5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies  ;   6) distributions received from equity method investees  ;   7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions  ;   and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017  , including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. Frontier is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard, but has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

(3)     Acquisitions  : 

The Verizon Acquisition 

On April 1, 2016, Frontier acquired the wireline operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. in California, Texas and Florida for a purchase price of   $10,540   million in cash and assumed debt (the Verizon Acquisition), pursuant to the February 5, 2015   Securities Purchase Agreement, as   amended.  In addition, Frontier and Verizon settled the working capital and net debt adjustments with   $15   million paid to Frontier in October 2016. As a result of the Verizon Acquisition, Frontier now operates these former Verizon properties, which included approximately     2.6   million total customers,   2.1   million broadband subscribers, and   1.2   million FiOS video subscribers as of April 1, 2016 (the CTF Operations).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

Our consolidated statement of operations for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   includes   $2,494     million of revenue and   $45  4     million of operating income related to the   six months of operating   results of the CTF Operations   since April 1, 2016  .   

The allocation of the purchase price presented below, which is preliminary and subject to change, represents the effect of recording the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Verizon Acquisition, based on the total transaction cash consideration of   $9,886   million   at September 30, 2016, as adjusted for the $15 million settlement payment discussed above  .    These current estimates will be revised in future periods for information that is currently not available to us, primarily related to certain legal and tax accruals and contingencies;   accounts receivable; property, plant and equipment; customer list and other intangibles; deferred income tax assets and liabilities;   pension assets and liabilities, as well as other assumed postretirement benefit obligations, pending completion of actuarial studies   and the related transfer of pension assets.   The revisions may affect the presentation of our consolidated financial results. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the assets and liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.    

The total consideration exceeded the net estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by   $2,341   million, which we recognized as goodwill. This goodwill is attributable to strategic benefits, including enhanced financial and operational scale, market diversification and leveraged combined networks that we expect to realize. Of this amount, goodwill associated with the Verizon Acquisition of $  1,912   million is deductible for income tax purposes  . 

The fair value estimates related to the allocation of the purchase price to Property, plant   equipment and Other intangibles were revised and updated during the third quarter of 2016 from the initial estimates as of June 30, 2016.  The allocation that was reported as of June 30, 2016 for Property, plant   equipment decreased   $1,378   million, from   $7,693   million to   $6,315   million, and for Other intangibles increased   $1,029   million, from   $1,160   million to   $2,189   million.  These adjustments resulted in lower depreciation expense during the third quarter (  $57   million of which is attributable to the second quarter) and higher amortization expense during the third quarter (  $62   million of which is attributable to the second quarter). 

The Securities Purchase Agreement provides for a post-closing adjustment for both pension liabilities and pension assets. Frontier and Verizon have not finalized the results of these calculations. Such calculations will be completed in accordance with the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement.  

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Frontier and the CTF Operations as if the Verizon Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the Verizon Acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2015. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not indicative of, nor does it purport to project, the future financial position or operating results of Frontier. The unaudited pro forma financial information excludes acquisition and integration costs and does not give effect to any estimated and potential cost savings or other operating efficiencies that may result from the Verizon Acquisition.

During the third quarter of 2016, we completed non-cash debt exchanges, including related accrued interest, of   $167   million of our   8.25%   Notes due   April 2017   for approximately   $171   million of our   10.5%   Notes due   September 2022  .   A pre-tax loss of approximately   $7   million was recognized and included in  Investment and other income (loss), net  in our consolidated statements of operations. 

In October 2016, we completed additional debt exchanges, including related accrued interest,   of   $84   million of our   8.25%   Notes due   April 2017   for approximately   $66     m  illion of our   8.875%   Notes due September 2020 and     $17   million of our   10.5%   Notes due September 2022  . 

On August 12, 2015, Frontier entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, for a   $1,500   million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (the 2015 Credit Agreement).   Frontier exercised its right under the 2015 Credit Agreement to obtain additional commitments and increased the size of the facility to   $1,625   million. On April 1, 2016, in connection with the closing of the   Verizon A  cquisition, Frontier drew   $1,550   million under that facility, with the additional   $75   million drawn subsequently.     The final maturity date is   March 31, 2021  .  Repayment of the outstanding principal balance will be made in quarterly installments, initially in the amount of   $  20   million per installment,   which commenced on June 30, 2016  .  The quarterly installments will increase to   $41   million, beginning with the 13th quarterly installment.  The remaining outstanding principal balance will be repaid on the final maturity date.  Borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the election of Frontier.  Interest rate margins under the facility (ranging from   0.75%   to   1.75%   for Base Rate borrowings and   1.75%   to   2.75%   for LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement).  Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement   are   secured by a pledge of the stock of Frontier North Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary  , primarily representing Frontier operations in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. 

Upon completion of the Verizon Acquisition on April 1, 2016, we also assumed additional debt of   $600   million, including   $200   million aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   Senior Notes due   May 15, 2027  ,    $300   million aggregate principal amount of   6.86%   Senior Notes due   February 1, 2028   and   $100   million aggregate principal amount of   8.50%   Senior Notes due   November 15, 2031  . 

On September 25, 2015, Frontier completed a private offering of   $6,600   million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Senior Notes, as follows:   $1,000   million of   8.875%   Senior Notes due   2020  ;    $2,000   million of   10.500%   Senior Notes due   2022  ; and   $3,600   million of   11.000%   Senior Notes due   2025  . Each was   issued   at a price equal to   100%   of its princ  ipal amount. Frontier   use  d   the   net proceeds from the offering   (after deducting underwriting fees)     to finance a portion of the cash consideration pa  id   in connection with the Verizon   Acquisition   and to pay related fees and expenses.   In   June 2016  , we completed an exchange offer of registered senior notes for the privately placed senior notes.   

On February 5, 2015, we entered into a commitment for a bridge loan facility (the Verizon Bridge Facility) and recognized related interest expense of   $10     million and   $184   million during the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accrued liabilities related to the Verizon Bridge Facility of   $184   million were paid after the closing of the Verizon   Acquisition   and are included in  Other current liabilities  in   the consolidated balance sheet   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The Verizon Bridge Facility terminated, in accordance with its terms, on September 25, 2015. 

Frontier has two senior secured credit agreements with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, lead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto: the first, drawn in 2011 (the 2011 CoBank Credit Agreement), was refinanced in October 2016 with a similar facility for $315 million, maturing on October 12, 2021 (the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement), and the second, drawn in 2014 (the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement), matures on October 24, 2019. We refer to the 2011 CoBank Credit Agreement, the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement and the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement collectively as the CoBank Credit Agreements. Borrowings under the CoBank Credit Agreements are secured by a pledge of the stock of Frontier North, Inc.  

Repayment of the outstanding principal balance for the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement will be made in quarterly installments of approximately $8 million beginning December 31, 2016. The remaining outstanding principal balance will be repaid on the final maturity date. Borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the election of Frontier.

The following is a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate to income taxes computed at the effective rate:    

Income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6 and 2015 include the impact   of   $  16     million and   $  11   million  , respectively,     of   benefit  s   resulting from the adjustment of deferred tax balances due to   the Verizon Acquisition i  n 2016, and   state tax law changes an  d   state filing method change  s   in 2015.     Income taxes for the nine months ended September  30,   2016 and   201  5   also include the impact of   $6 million and   $2   million  , respectively, in benefits   from the adjustment of Federal r  esearch and development credits, along with a   $12   million reversal of benefits and a   $7   million benefit, respectively, related to the domestic production activities deduction.

(11  )    Net   Loss   Per Share  : 

The reconciliation of the net loss   per share calculation is as follows: 

In calculating diluted net loss per share for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015, the effect of all common stock equivalents is excluded from the computation as the effect would be antidilutive  . 

Stock Options 

For the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , options to   purchase   40,000     and   68,000     shares,   respectively,   issuable under employee compensation plans were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings   (loss)   per share (EPS) for those periods because the exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. In calculating diluted EPS, we apply the treasury stock method and include future unearned compensation as part of the assumed proceeds. 

Stock Units 

At   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , we had   1,743,345   and   1,334,633   stock uni  ts, respectively, issued under the   Non-Employee Directors  Deferred Fee Equity Plan (Deferred   Fee Plan)  ,   the Non-Employee Directors  Equity Incentive Plan (Directors  Equity Plan)   and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan  . These securities have not been included in the diluted   EPS   calculation because their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.   There were   no   compensation costs associated with the issuance of stock units for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   ($1)   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   201  5.

At   September 30, 2016  , we ha  d    six    s  tock-based compensation plans under which grants were made and awards remained outstanding. No further awards may be granted under   five   of the plans: the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the 1996 EIP), the Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 EIP), the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2009 EIP)  ,   the Deferred Fee Plan   and the Directors  Equity Plan  . At   September 30, 2016  , there   were    20,000,000   shares authorized for grant   and   6,460,000   shares   available for grant under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 EIP and together with the 1996 EIP, the 2000 EIP and the 2009 EIP, the EIPs). Our general policy is to issue shares from treasury upon the grant of restricted shares and the exercise of options. 

Performance Shares 

On February   11  , 201  6  , the Compensation Committee   of our Board of Directors   granted approximately   1,6  69,000   performance shares under the Frontier Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and set the operating cash flow performance goal for 201  6  , which applies to the first year in the 201  6  -201  8   measurement period, the second year of the 201  5  -201  7   measurement period and the third year of the 201  4  -201  6   measurement period.  

The following summary presents information regarding LTIP target performance shares as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months then ended with regard to LTIP shares awarded under the 2009 EIP and the 2013 EIP: 

For purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each performance share is measured at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Frontier common stock as well as performance relative to the targets. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  ,    we recognized compensation   expense  , reflected in  Selling, general and administrative expenses,      of   $4     million and   $6     million  , respectively,   for the LTIP. 

Restricted Stock 

The following summary presents information regarding unvested restricted stock as of   September 30, 2016   and changes during the   nine   months then ended with regard to restricted stock under the 2009 EIP and the 2013 EIP: 

For purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each restricted stock grant is estimated based on the average of the high and low market price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested restricted stock awards   that is deferred   at   September 30, 2016   was   $33     million  ,   and the weighted average   vesting   period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is   approximately   2   years.

Shares granted during the first   nine   months of 201  5     totaled   2,814,000  . The   total fair value of shares of restricted stock granted and vested at   September 30, 2015   was   approximately   $13   million and   $15   million, respectively. The total fair value of unvested restricted stock at   September   30, 2015 was   $  34   million. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015 was   $7.9  2   per share  . 

We have granted restricted stock awards to employees in the form of our common stock. None of the restricted stock awards may be sold, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, by the employees until the restrictions lapse, subject to limited exceptions. The restrictions are time-based. Compensation expense, recognized in  Selling, general and administrative expenses  ,       of   $14   million   and   $13   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively, has been recorded in connection with these grants.  

(1  3  )    Comprehensive Income (Loss)  : 

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting shareholders  investment and pension/postretirement benefit (OPEB) liabilities that, under GAAP, are excluded from net loss. 

The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax at   September   30, 2016 and 2015, and changes for the   nine   months then ended, are as follows: 

As a resu  lt of the Verizon Acquisition  , the Frontier Communications Pension Plan (the Plan)   was remeasured.  This remeasurement resulted in a     decrease   in   the   discount rate   from   4.5%   at December 31, 2015 to   4.0%   at the date of the Verizon Acquisition  .  This change in the discount rate   resulted in    a   remeasurement charge to Other comprehensive i  ncome (loss) of   $10  5     million during the third quarter of 2016.

The following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost: 

During the first   nine months of 2  01  6   and 201  5  , we   capitalized   $18   million   and   $15   million,   respectively, of pension and OPEB expense into the cost of our capital expenditures, as the costs relate to our engineering and plant constructio  n activities.  

In connection with the completion of the Verizon Acquisition, certain employees were transferred to the Plan effective April 1, 2016. Our pension plan assets increased from   $1,572   million at December 31, 2015 to   $2,858   million at September 30, 2016, an increase of   $1,286   million, or   82%  . This increase was a result of cash transfers and accounts receivable from Verizon and the Verizon pension plan trusts of   $1,127   million related to the Verizon Acquisition, positive investment returns of   $235   million, net of investment management and administrative fees, and Frontier contributions of   $25   million, partially offset by benefit payments of   $101   million during the first nine months of 2016.  

During the third quarter of 2016, Frontier contributed a real estate property with an aggregate fair value of   $15   million for the purpose of funding a portion of its contribution obligations to the Plan. We have entered into a long-term lease arrangement with the Plan. The property is managed on behalf of the Plan by an independent fiduciary, and the terms of the lease were negotiated with the fiduciary on an arm s-length basis.   

We made total contributions to our pension plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of   $25   million, consisting of cash payments of   $10   million and the contribution of real property with a fair value of   $15   million.  An additional cash contribution of   $3   million was made on October 15, 2016, for total contributions of   $28   million in 2016. Frontier estimates that there are no further contributions required for 2016.

(1  5  )    Commitments and Contingencies  : 

Although from time to time we make short-term purchasing commitments to vendors with respect to capital expenditures, we generally do not enter into firm, written contracts for such activities.  

In June 2015, Frontier accepted the Federal Communications Commission s (FCC) offer of support to price cap carriers under the Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II program, which is intended to provide long-term support for broadband   in high cost unserved or underserved areas  . This   program   provides   $332   million in annual support, including   $49   million in annual support related to the properties acquired in the Verizon   Acquisition  ,    through   2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to approximately   774,000   households across   certain of   the   29   states where we   now operate  . To the   extent we do not enable the required number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service by the end of the CAF Phase II term, we will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received.  

On April 28, 2016, the FCC completed its inquiry into whether certain terms and conditions contained in specifically identified special access tariff pricing plans offered by four carriers, including Fron  tier, are just and reasonable.   The FCC held that certain of the tariff terms for business data TDM services, specifically DS1s   and DS3s, were unreasonable.   Specifically, the FCC struck   down    excessive  early termination fees and    all-or-nothing  provisions.   Frontier has revised its tariffs in ac  cordance with the FCC s Order.   The FCC s decision has no retroactive effect, and we anticipate no material impact to Frontier from it.   

The FCC deferred the issue of how its ruling will affect customers currently purchasing services from these tariffs to a   Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.   It is seeking comment on proposed changes to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services and on a proposal to adopt pricing rules for Ethernet services in markets that are   found to be  noncompetitive.      The potential impact to Frontier of this proceeding is unknown, though any pending initiative could adversely affect our operations or financial results.   

During the first   nine months   of 2016, we increased our outstanding performance letters of credit from   $50   million at December 31, 2015 to   $125     million as of   September   30, 2016.  

We are party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class actions) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with   other carriers.   

In October 2013, the California Attorney General s Office notified certain Verizon companies, including one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Verizon Acquisition, of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed   $100,000  , we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material. 

We accrue an expense for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.  None of our existing accruals for pending matters, after considering insurance coverage, is material. We monitor our pending litigation for the purpose of adjusting our accruals and revising our disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is, however, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. We will vigorously defend our interests in pending litigation, and as of this date, we believe that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or our cash flows.

Overview 

Verizon Acquisition:   On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Verizon s wireline properties in California, Texas, and Florida (the CTF Operations).        Frontier s scope of operations and balance sheet changed materially as a result of the completion of the Verizon Acquisition. Historical financial and operating data presented for Frontier includes the results of the CTF Operations that were acquired in the Verizon Acquisition from the date of acquisition on April 1, 2016   and   is not indicative of future operating results. The financial discussion below includes a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for Frontier operations as of and for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015. Unless otherwise noted, the variance explanations discussed below are based upon an analysis of the 2016 financial data for Frontier legacy operations (excluding the CTF Operations) in comparison to 2015. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of the Verizon Acquisition. 

Based on operating results, current estimates and assumptions, we are currently realizing cost synergies and anticipate further cost synergies with respect to the operations acquired in the Verizon Acquisition, by leveraging the scalability of our existing corporate administrative functions and information technology and network systems.  We have replaced functions formerly provided by Verizon or third-party service providers at a cost which, collectively, is less than the expense of these shared services previously allocated to the CTF Operations by Verizon. As of   June   30, 2016, we estimated that approximately     $1 billion     of expected annualized cost synergies ha  d   been achieved resulting from our operation of the CTF Operations versus the CTF historical results  . 

Our consolidated statement of operations for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   includes $  2,494   million   of total revenue   and $  45  4   million of operating income related to the   six months of operating   results   for   the CTF Operations from the date of the acquisition on April 1, 2016.  

New Organizational Structure:    On November 1, 2016, we announced a new organizational structure, which will become effective December 1, 2016.  Under this new structure, we are creating separate and specialized consumer and commercial business units, as well as centralizing our non-operations functions (including Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Communications and Marketing) while repositioning our existing seven regional organizations as   field   operations units.  This new organizational structure will enable us to focus on the differing needs of consumer and business customers, more efficiently allocate resources, increase standardization of business processes, and improve operational performance.   

Video:   A key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service  , to be marketed under our Vantage video brand,   in a number of our existing markets, with a cost-effective, success-based capital outlay, by leveraging our fiber to the node architecture. This represents a potential incremental revenue opportunity for Frontier that takes advantage of our increasing scale and the substantial investments that we have already made in our broadband network.   W  e believe that we are the eighth largest provider of linear video services to residential customers   in the United States, based on the total number of residential video customers.   As of   September   30, 2016, we have   1.24   million   linear video subscribers that are served with FiOS      video or Vantage video service. In addition to our linear video subscribers, we   have   280,000     DISH      satellite video customers. 

Broadband:   A key element of our strategy is to enable and strengthen the broadband capabilities of our network.   A  s of   September 30  , 2016, we h  ad   the capability to offer broadband to approximately   8   million households, or   93  % of the   8.6   mil  lion households in our legacy   markets. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we   lost   approximately   99,200 and 151,800, respectively, net broadband subscribers on a consolidated   basis  , primarily due to lower gross activations and slightly higher customer churn.     We continue to invest in network speed and capacity to support our goal of increasing broadband penetration and market share.   In our legacy markets, we continue to invest in our network and in our management and provisioning platforms to expand higher-speed products.   To date in 2016, we have upgraded more than 800,000 addressable households to 50 Mbps or higher speed capability, with an incremental 300,000 homes to be completed in our CTF Operations by the first quarter of 2017.   The combination of our plans to upgrade both the legacy and CTF markets will improve our speed profile to approximately 2 million households. Following completion, over 40% of our households will be capable of receiving speeds in excess of 50 Mbps.  

Revenue Summary:   Total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $  2,324   million to $  6,487   million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding additional revenue of $  2,49  4 million attributable to the CTF Operations, our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $17  0   million, or 4%, as compared to the first nine months of 2015. This decline in 2016 is primarily the result of decreases in voice services

revenues and lower switched and nonswitched access revenue, partially offset by an increase in subsidy revenues and data services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Customer revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $  2,197   million to $  5,889   million as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Excluding additional customer revenue of $  2,371   million attributable to the CTF Operations, our customer revenue for the first nine months of 2016 decreased $17  4   million, or   5  %, as compared to prior year period. 

Customer trends and revenue performance:   We provide service and product   options in our residential and business offerings to the customer base in each of our markets which results in a better customer experience that allows us to maximize retention of existing customers and attract new customers. As of September 30, 2016, 64% of our residential broadband customers were subscribed to at least one other service offering.  

Total consolidated residential revenue for the first   nine   months of 2016 increased $  1,349   million, or   73  %, as compared to the prior year period. Total consolidated residential revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $1,4  55   million of revenue attributable to the CTF Operations. Residential customer revenues for our legacy operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $  36   million, or   6  %, and $  10  6   million, or   6  %, respectively  , compared to the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2015. Similar to other wireline providers, we have experienced declines in the number of traditional voice customers, switched access minutes of use and rates per minute of use as a result of competition and the availability of substitutes, a trend which we expect will continue. Our residential customer monthly churn   was 2.08% and 1.94  %, for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, compared to   1.97%     and 1.84%   for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015. We had approximately   5,073,000   and   3,147,000   total residential customers as of   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Through   September   30, 2016, we had a net increase of   1,949,000   residential customers from the beginning of the year. These residential customer increases were pri  ncipally due to the addition of 2,321,000   customers as part of the Verizon Acquisition, partially offset by a decline of   372,000   customers during the first   nine   months of 2016. The consolidated monthly average revenue per customer (ARPC) for our residential customers   was $  82.34   and $  76.11   for   the three and   nine months ended September   30, 2016 compared to $6  3.83 and $64.18   for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015. The overall increase in residential ARPC is a result of higher video revenue from our CTF Operations and improvements in data services revenue   for our legacy operations  , partially offset by lower voice services revenue.   We expect   to improve our   video and data   subscriber trends   for our Frontier legacy operations, and   we do anticipate   continuing declines in voice services revenue   as fewer residential customers subscribe to landline voice services  . 

Total consolidated business revenue for the first nine months of 2016 increased $  848   million, or 46%, as compared to the prior year period. Total consolidated business revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $  916   million of revenue attributable to the CTF Operations. Total business revenue for our legacy operations declined $  26   million,   or   4  %,   and $  6  8   million, or   4  %, as compared   with the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015, principally as a result of decreases in our voice services revenue and wireless backhaul revenue. We had   approximately 516,000   and 29  4  ,000 total business customers as of   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Through   September   30, 2016, we had a net increase of   227  ,000   business customers from the beginning of the year. These business customer increases were principall  y due to the addition of   250,000 customers   as part of the Verizon Acquisition, partially offset by a decline of   23,000   customers during the first   nine   months of 2016. We incurred a reduction of   approximately 2%     of our bus  iness customers, net, during each of the three month periods   ended   September 30, 2016 and   2015, and 4%   and   3  % during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The consolidated ARPC for our business customers   decreased $  25.2  8  ,   or   4  %  , to $668.30   and $  10.83  , or   2  %  , to $676.80   during   the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 as compared with the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015.   The business ARPC decrease is primarily attributable to our CTF markets having   lower ARPC per SME (small business, medium business and larger enterprise customers)     customer and   proportionally fewer wholesale customers relative to total business customers as compared to our   legacy markets. We expect the declines in voice services revenues and wireless backhaul revenues from business customers to continue in 2016, mitigated, in part, by increases in data services revenues. We have seen modest increases in our revenues from   SME     customers   in   2016, and our Ethernet product revenues from our SME and carrier customers has grown   by 8%    (  within our legacy operations  ) in the first   nine   months of 2016   as compared to the prior year  , partially offsetting the decline in wireless backhaul revenue. 

Total s  witched access and subs  idy re  venue of $59  8   million represented 9% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Switched access revenue was $130 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or 2% of our revenues, as compared to $135 million, or   3  % of our revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The Report and Order released by the FCC on November 18, 2011 (the 2011 Order) provided for the gradual elimination of terminating traffic charges by 2017 with a related decline in operating expenses.   Switched access revenue declined sequentially in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011 Order, and we anticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related  

28   

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) 

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

to the 2011 Order.        We have been able to recover a significant portion of these lost revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms, a trend we expect will continue throughout the remainder of   2016.   We expect declining revenue trends in switched access revenue to continue during the remainder of 2016. Subsidy revenue, including CAF Phase II subsidies, was $468 million, or 7% of our revenues, for the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared     to   $  336   million, or   8  %, of our revenues, for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2015.       

In the section      Revenue and Customer Related Metrics    below is   a table   that presents customer counts,   ARPC   and   customer   churn.  It also categorizes revenue into customer revenue (  residential and   business) and regulatory revenue (switched access a  nd subsidy revenue).       

The following should be re  ad in conjunction with Item 7.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for   the year ended December 31, 2015.

REVENUE AND CUSTOMER RELATED METRICS 

30   

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) 

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

REVENUE 

We generate revenues primarily through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage, and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts.  

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues among the following five categories: 

Voice Services 

Voice services include traditional local and long distance wireline services, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as a number of unified messaging services offered to our residential and business customers.  Voice services also include the long distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our business customers and other carriers. 

Voice services revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $50     million, or 10%, and $166 million, or 11%, primarily due to the continued loss of voice   customers and, to a lesser extent, decreases in individual feature packages, partially   offset by increased local voice charges to residential and business end users.  

Data and Internet Services    

Data and internet services include broadband services for residential and business customers. We provide data transmission services to high volume business customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits ( nonswitched access ) including services to wireless providers ( wireless backhaul ). We also offer a host of data services to our residential customers  

31   

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) 

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

marketed under our Frontier Secure      brand, including computer security, cloud back-up and sharing, identity protection and technical support. Frontier Secure also provides technical support services for businesses.  

Data and Internet services revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $8 million, and increased $5 million, respectively. Data services revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $  6   million, or 2%, to $345 million and $42 million, or 4%, to $1,03  5   million. The   year to date   increase is primarily due to a   2  % increase in the total number of broadband subscribers since September 30, 2015, and higher Frontier Secure      revenues.   Nonswitched access revenues   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased $1  4   million, or 5%, to $  236   million a  nd $37 million, or 5%, to $718   million  . The decrease is   primarily due to lower monthly recurring   revenues for   wireless backhaul and other carrier services.   We expect wireless data usage to continue to increase, which may drive the need for additional wireless backhaul capacity. Despite the need for additional capacity, in the near term, we anticipate that our overall wireless backhaul revenues (which comprise approximately 3% of consolidated total revenues) will continue to be subject to decline in 2016, as our carrier customers migrate to Ethernet solutions at lower price points or migrate to our competitors. 

Video  

Video services     include revenues generated from services provided directly to residential customers through the FiOS video and Vantage   video   brands, and through DISH satellite TV services. 

For our Frontier legacy operations, video revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $6 million, or 8%, and $13 million, or 6%,   respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the total number of video subscribers. 

Other    

Other customer revenue includes sales of customer premise equipment to our business customers and directory services  , less   our provision for bad debts.   

Other revenue for the three   months ended September 30, 2016 increased $  2   million, or   3%,   primarily due to   an increase in customer premise equipment sales during the third quarter. 

Switched Access and Subsidy 

Switched access and subsidy revenues include revenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long distance voice traffic ( switched access ). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. We also receive cost subsidies from state and federal authorities, including the Connect America Fund. 

Switched access and subsidy revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $  50   million, or   25  %, and increased $  4   million, or 1%, respectively.  Subsidy revenues decreased $  39   million and increased $  30   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The   increase   in subsidy revenue   during the first nine months of 2016   was primarily attributable to the additional CAF Phase II funding that was recognized initially in the third quarter of 2015.   Subsidy revenue during the third quarter of 2016 was lower than the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to one-time true-up payments and phasedown support recognized in the third quarter of 2015 in connection with the CAF Phase II program.     Switched access revenue decreased $11 million and $2  6   million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the impact of the decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless and other   communications   services  , combined with the lower rates enacted by the FCC s intercarrier compensation   reform in July 2013. We expect that these trends underlying the reduction in switched access revenue will continue through 2016  .

OPERATING EXPENSES 

NETWORK ACCESS EXPENSES 

Network access expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network, and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude network related expenses, depreciation and amortization, and employee related e  xpenses. 

Network access expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   de  creased $  5   million, or   3  %, and $  6   million, or   1  %,   respectively  ,    primarily   due to a   de  crease   in long distance costs and video content costs  , partially   offset by increased customer premise equipment costs.       

NETWORK RELATED   EXPENSES 

Network related expenses include expenses associated with the delivery of services to customers and the operation and maintenance of our network, such as facility rent, utilities, maintenance and other costs, as well as salaries, wages and related benefits associated with personnel who are responsible for the delivery of services, operation and maintenance of our network.  

Network related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   de  creased $  10   million, or   3  %, and   increased   $  6   million, or   1  %, respectively  .  The decrease in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily     due to a decrease   in compensation and certain benefits, including pension and OPEB expense (as discussed below)  . The increase in the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to increased outside service costs such as installation and construction, higher regulatory and industry fees, and increased pension costs, slightly offset by lower compensation and benefits  .

SG A     expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   de  creased $  4   million, or 1%, and   increased   $  48   million, or   5  %, respectively, due to higher costs for compensation, primarily related to increased employee headcount due to additional services provided by Frontier Secure, and certain benefits, including pension and OPEB expense (as discussed below).     Total consolidated severance costs of $11 million were incurred in the third quarter of 2016 and are included in SG A expenses, including $8 million for our CTF Operations and $3 million for Frontier Legacy  .   

Pension and OPEB costs 

Frontier allocates p  ension and OPEB costs   to network related expenses and SG A expenses. Total consolidated p  ension and OPEB costs   for   the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   as follows:

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE 

The fair value estimates related to the allocation of the purchase price to Property, plant   equipment and   O  ther intangibles were revised and updated during the third quarter of 2016   from the initial estimates as of June 30, 2016  .  The allocation that was reported as of June 30, 2016 for Property, plant   equipment decreased $1,37  8   million, from $7,693 million to $6,31  5   million  , and for O  ther intangibles increased $1,029 million, from $1,160 million to $2,189 million.  These adjustments resulted in lower depreciation expense during the third quarter ($57 million of which is attributable to the second quarter) and higher amortization expense during the third quarter ($62 million of which is attributable to the second quarter). 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  ,   2016     decreased $24   million, or   7%, and $71   million, or   7%,   primarily   due to the accelerated method of amortization related to the customer lists that were acquired in our 2010 transaction with Verizon and in the Connecticut Acquisition, combined with changes in the   remaining useful lives of certain plant assets and a lower net asset base.

Investment and other income (loss), net 

Investment and other income (loss), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included interest income   of $12   million, primarily due to interest earned on restricted cash during the first quarter of 2016, and a loss on debt exchanges in the third quarter of 2016 of $7 million. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased $14  0   million, or   57%,   and $  39  4 million, or   5  2  %,   respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   We incurred additional interest of $  559   million in 2016 on the $6,600 million debt financing and the $1,625 million term loan facility related to     the Verizon Acquisition. We incurred   commitment   fees of   $  10   million and   $184 million on the bridge loan facility related to the Verizon Acquisition during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015  , respectively.     Our composite average borrowing rate as of   September 30, 2016   and 201  5     was 8.55  % and   8.97%, respectively  . 

Income tax   benefit 

Income tax benefit for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016,   increased   $  22   million and $  120   million  ,    as compared to the three   and nine   months ended   September 30  , 2015.   The   effective tax rate on our pretax loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 was   42.0  %   as compared with   49.7  % for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015. The   in  crease in income tax benefit was primarily due to the   in  crease in pretax loss.  Income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   and 2015   include the impact of $  16   million and $  11   million  ,   respectively,   of tax   benefit  s   resulting from the adjustment of deferred tax balances due to the Verizon Acquisition in 2016, and state tax law changes an  d   state filing method change  s   in 2015.

Analysis of Cash Flows 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating to $331 million. Our primary source of funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was restricted and unrestricted cash, along with cash generated from operations  .     For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used cash flow from operations  , restricted cash and   cash on hand to   principally fund all of our cash investing and financing activities, primarily the Verizon Acquisition, capital expenditures, dividends and debt repayments. On April 1, 2016, we used the restricted cash obtained from the net proceeds of the September 2015 debt offering and June 2015 equity offering  s  , along with additional borrowings and cash on hand, to finance the Verizon Acquisition.

At   September   30, 2016, we had a working capital   deficit     of $  762   million  ,    including $509 million of long-term debt due within one year,   as compared to a   working capital surplus of $8,238   million at   December 31, 2015  .    The decline in working capital is primarily due to a reduction in   restricted cash and unrestricted   cash and cash equivalents of $  9,049 million, primarily   related to financing the Verizon Acquisition  ,   and an increase in current   liabilities of $  513   million  .    

Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities 

Cash flows provided by operating   activities   decreased    $  9 million     to $952 million   for   the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compar  ed with the prior year period.   The   de  crease was primarily the result   of un  favor  able changes in working capital, along with   higher interest expense and acquisition and integration costs  , partially offset by the addition of our CTF operations. 

We   received    $  35   million     in refunds   and   paid   $  27   million   in net cash taxes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively.    

In connection with the   Verizon Acquisition  ,    Frontier     recognized   acquisition and integration costs   of   $  387   million   during the first   nine   months of 201  6    compared to $112 million during the first nine months of 2015. Interest expense of $559 million was incurred during the first nine months of 2016 related to the September 2015 debt offering and the 2015 Credit Agreement (as defined below) compared to $11 million in interest expense during the first nine months of 2015.

In addition to the capital expenditures mentioned above, network expansion funded by previously received   Connect America Fund (  CAF  )     Phase I   funds   amounted   to   $  22     million for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   201  5. Capital expenditures related to CAF Phase II are   included in our reported amounts for capital expend  itures. We anticipate capital expenditures for business operations to increase in 2016 to   approximately $1,2  50   million to $  1,275   million, as compared to $863 million in 2015, as a result of the Verizon Acquisition and expenditures   related to the CAF Phase II program  .

Debt Reduction  

During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we re  tired an aggregate principal   amount of $  2  80   million and $  274   million, respectively, of debt consisting of   $189   million and $  272   million, respectively, of senior   un  secured debt.   Additionally, we repaid $9  1   million and $2   million of secured debt during   the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

During the third quarter of 2016, we completed   non-cash   debt exchanges, including related accrued interest, of $167 million of our 8.25% Notes due April 2017 for approximately $171 million of our 10.5% Notes due September 2022. A pre-tax loss of approximately $7 million was recognized and included in  Investment and other income (loss), net  in our consolidated statements of operations. 

In October 2016, we completed additional debt exchanges, including related accrued interest, of $84 million of our 8.25% Notes due April 2017 for approximately $66 million of our 8.875% Notes due September 2020 and $17 million of our 10.5% Notes due September 2022. As a result of these exchanges, $84 million of amounts classified as  Long-term debt due within one year  on the consolidated balance sheet was reclassified as  Long term debt   as of September 30, 2016.

Subject to limitations contained in our indentures and credit facilities, we may from time to time make repurchases of our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations.  

Capital Resources 

We believe our operating cash flo  ws, existing cash balances,   existing revolving credit facility   and access to the capital markets, as necessary,   will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt   interest     and principal   payments, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders, and support our short-term and long-term operating strategies   for the next twelve months. A   number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic   conditions     may negatively affect   our cash generated   from operations.   As of   September 30, 2016, we   had $  38   million   of debt maturing during the last   three   months of 201  6; $509 million   and $733   millio  n of debt   will   matur  e   in 201  7   and 201  8  , respectively.  

Bridge Facilities 

On February 5, 2015, we entered into a commitment for a bridge loan facility (the Verizon Bridge Facility) and recognized related interest expense of $10 million and $184 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Verizon Bridge Facility terminated, in accordance with its terms, on September 25, 2015. 

Term Loan Facilities 

On August 12, 2015, Frontier entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, for a $1,500 million senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility (the 2015 Credit Agreement).    Frontier exercised its right under the 2015 Credit Agreement to obtain additional commitments and increased the size of the facility to $1,625 million. On April 1, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Verizon Acquisition, Frontier drew $1,550 million under that facility, with the additional $75 million drawn subsequently.   The final maturity date is March 31, 2021.  Repayment of the outstanding principal balance will be made in quarterly installments, initially in the amount of $20 million per installment,   which commenced on   June 30, 2016. The quarterly installments will increase to $41 million, beginning with the 13th quarterly installment.  The remaining outstanding principal balance will be repaid on the final maturity date.  Borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the election of Frontier.  Interest rate margins under the facility (ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.75% to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement).  Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of the stock of Frontier North Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, primarily representing Frontier operations in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  

Frontier has two senior secured credit agreements with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, lead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto: the first, drawn in 2011 (the 2011 CoBank Credit Agreement), was refinanced in October 2016 with a similar facility for $315 million, maturing on October 12, 2021 (the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement), and the second, drawn in 2014 (the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement), matures on October 24, 2019. We refer to the 2011 CoBank Credit Agreement, the 2014 CoBank Credit Agreement and the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement collectively as the CoBank Credit Agreements. Borrowings under each of the CoBank Credit Agreements are secured by a pledge of the stock of F  rontier North, Inc. 

Repayment of the outstanding principal balance for the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement will be made in quarterly installments of approximately $8 million beginning December 31, 2016. The remaining outstanding principal balance will be repaid on the final maturity date. Borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the election of Frontier. Interest rate margins under the facility (ranging from 0.875% to 2.875% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.875% to 3.875% for LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustment based on Frontier s Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement). The term loan under the 2016 CoBank Credit Agreement is secured by a pledge of the stock of Frontier North Inc  . 

As a result of the above debt related transactions in October 2016, $270 million of amounts classified   as  Long-term debt due within one year  on   the consolidated balance sheet was reclassified as  Long term debt   as of September 30, 2016  .

Revolving Credit Facility 

Frontier has a revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto and the other parties named therein (the Revolving Credit Agreement), for a   $750     million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility)   with a scheduled termination date of May 31, 2018.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,    the Revolving Credit Facility was fully available and   no   borrowin  gs had been made thereunder.   The Revolving Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be u  sed to fund dividend payments.  Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be secured by a pledge of the stock of Frontier North, Inc. 

Covenants 

The terms and conditions contained in our indentures, the CoBank Credit Agreements, the 2015 Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the incurrence of liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries  assets, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by our subsidiaries and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control subject to important qualifications and exceptions. We would be restricted from declaring dividends under the CoBank Credit Agreements, the 2015 Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement if an event of default occurred and was continuing at the time or would result from the dividend declaration. In addition, under the Certificate of Designations of our 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, we would be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock, if we failed to declare and pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. 

The CoBank Credit Agreements, the 2015 Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement each contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under those covenants, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters not to exceed 4.50 to 1.   

Indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens on our assets securing indebtedness and our subsidiaries  assets or merge or consolidate with other companies, our subsidiaries  ability to borrow funds and to engage in change of control transactions, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The indentures for our 8.875% senior notes due 2020, our 10.500% senior notes due 2022, and our 11.000% senior notes due 2025 contain covenants that are customary for similarly rated issuers. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness if our leverage ratio exceeds 4.5 to 1 (as defined in the indentures), limits liens and subsidiary debt to 1.25 times EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), limits cumulative restricted payments, including dividends, to cumulative EBITDA less 1.4 times cumulative interest expense (as defined in the indenture), and restricts our ability to divest substantially all of the assets of Frontier. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance   with all of our   indenture and credit facility covenants.  

Dividends 

We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on our common and preferred stock. Our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations.   Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an   annual rate of 11.125% of the initial liquidation preference of $100 per share, or $11.125 per year per share. Series A Preferred Stock dividends   of $161   million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The declaration and payment of future dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, payment of cumulative dividends on Series A Preferred Stock, applicable law, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors our Board of Directors deem relevant. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a   material   current or future effect upon our financial statements.

Future Commitments 

On April 29, 2015, the FCC released its right of first refusal offer of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program, which is intended to provide long-term support for broadband in high cost unserved or underserved areas.   In June 2015, Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer, which provides for $332 million in annual support, including $49 million in annual support related to the properties acquired in the Verizon   Acquisition  , through 2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to approximately 774,000 households across   certain of   the 29 states where we   now   operate  . 

To the extent we do not enable the required number of households with 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service by the end of the CAF Phase II term, we will be required to return a portion of the funds previously received. 

Contractual Obligations 

During   the first nine months of 2016, we increased our outstanding performance letters of credit from $50 million at December 31, 2015 to $125   million as of September 30, 2016.  

Critical Accounting   Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. 

These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with   the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

There have been no   material   changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7.

Regulatory   Developments 

On April 29, 2015, the FCC released offers of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program, which is intended to provide long-term support for carriers establishing and prov  iding broadband service in high   cost unserved or underserved areas  .     Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer, which provides for $  332   million in annual support  , including $49 million in annual support related to the properties acquired in the Verizon   Acquisition  ,   through 2020 to make available 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream broadband service to approximately   774  ,000 households across   certain of   the 2  9   states where we   now   operate. CAF   Phase II support is a successor to and augments the approximately $156 mi  llion in annual USF frozen high   cost support that Frontier had been receiving  , and the $42 million in annual   transitional   USF frozen high cost support that Verizon had been receiving in   California and   Texas  .    When combined with the fro  zen high   cost phasedown payment discussed below, CAF Phase II funding support   increased   by more than $159 million in 2015. In addition to the CAF Phase II annual support, Frontier will also receive frozen support phasedown payments through 2018. The FCC adopted phasedown payments to help compensate carriers in those limited circumstances in which CAF II fundin  g results in a decrease in high   cost support whe  n compared to prior frozen high   cost support payments. Frontier s phasedown support was $35 million in 2015, and is expected to be approximately   $27 million in 2016 (including $2 million for the acquired properties), $17 million in 2017 (including $1 million for the acquired prop  erties), and $6 million in 2018  . 

In 2016, the FCC is expected to adopt a competitive bidding process to continue to distribute CAF Phase II funding in those high cost areas where price cap carriers declined the FCC s offer of support. Whether Frontier will participate in any competitive bid process is unknown at this time.

We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  , including those associated with our pension   plan   assets  . Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in int  erest rates and equity prices.   We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial ins  truments for trading purposes.   As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  ,   and we are not party to any market risk management agreements   other than in the normal course of business  .     Our primary market risk exposures   from   interest rate risk and equity price risk   are   as follows: 

Interest Rate Exposure 

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest-bearing portion of our   pension   investment portfolio     and   the   related   actuarial liability for pension   obligations,   as well as our   floating rate indebtedness.   As of   September   30  , 2016  ,    88  %     of   our     total   debt   had   fixed   interest   rate  s  .    We had no   interest rate swap agreements   related to our fixed rate debt in effect at   September   30  , 2016  . We   believe that   our     currently outstanding obligation   exposure to interest rate changes is minimal.       O  ur undrawn    $  750   million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with   the   LIBO   Rate  , as defined.   Consequently, we have limited   material   future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interes  t rates on our   debt.   A  n   adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable   rate   obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fix  ed rate obligations.   Based upon our overal  l interest rate exposure  , a near-term change in interest rates would not   material  ly affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

At   September   30  , 2016  , the fair value of our long-term debt was estimated to be   approximately $  17.8     b  illion, based on   prevailing interest rates,   our overall weighted average     borrowing   rate   was     8.55  % and our overall weighted   average   maturity   was     approximately   eight     years.     As   of   September   30  , 2016  ,    there has   been no   significant   change   in   the   weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations   since December 31,   201  5  .    

Equity Price Exposure 

Our exposure to market risks for changes in   equity   security   prices as of   September   30  , 2016   is limited   to   our pension   plan   assets.    We have no other   security   investments of any   significant   amount. 

Our     pension plan assets   in  creased   from $  1,572   million at December 31,   201  5     to $  2,858   million at   September   30,   2016  ,    an increase of $  1,286   million,   or   82  %. This increase   was   a result of   cash   transfers   and accounts receivable   from   Verizon and   the Verizon p  ension   plan   trusts of $  1,127   million related to the Verizon Acquisition,   positive investment returns   of $  2  3  5   million  ,   net of investment management and administrative fees  ,   and contributions of   $  25     million  ,    partially   offset by benefit   payments of $  10  1     million during the first   nine months   of 2016.       

We made total contributions to our pension plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2  5   million, consisting of cash payments   of   $10 million and the contribution of real property with a fair value of $1  5   million.  An additional   cash

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

contribution of $  3   million was made on October 15, 2016     for   total contribution  s   of $2  8   million in 2016.   Frontier   estimates that there are no further contributions required for 2016  . 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 

(a) 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures     

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures   (as defined in Rule  s   13a-15(e)   and 15d  -  15(e)   under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)  .  Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report,   September   30  , 2016  ,    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.       

(b) 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting     

We reviewed our internal control over financial reporting at   September   30  , 2016  .    There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in an evaluation thereof that occurred during the   third     fiscal quarter of   201  6     that   material  ly affected, or   are   reasonably likely to   material  ly affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

I  tem 1.          Legal Proceedings 

See Note 1  5   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.    There have been no   material   changes to our legal proceedings from the information provided in Item 3.       Legal Proceedings      included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   201  5  .       

We are party to various legal proceedings   (including individual, class and putative class actions)   arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of matters   and   types of claims including  , but not limited to,   general contract  s  ,    billing disputes,   rights of access,     taxes and surcharges  , consumer protection, trademark   and patent   infringement, employment, regulatory  ,   tort  ,    claims   of competitors and disputes with other carriers  .  Litigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable.  However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which   we are   entitled, will not have a   material     adverse   effect on our financial position, results of operations, or our cash flows.     

In October 2013, the California Attorney General s Office notified certain Verizon companies, including one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Verizon Acquisition, of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material.

This Separation Agreement and Release (this    Agreement   ) is entered into by and between   Frontier Communications Corporation     (   Frontier   ),     its affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions (Frontier and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions are, collectively, the    Company   ), and   John M. Jureller   (the    Employee   ).   

WHEREAS, the Employee s functions at the Company will be transitioned to the Executive Vice President   Chief Financial Officer-Elect (the    CFO-Elect   ) between September 12, 2016 and November 4, 2016 (the    Transition Period   ), and Employee will be fully cooperative, collaborative and supportive of and with that transition and the CFO-Elect. 

WHEREAS, Employee s employment with the Company will terminate on November 4, 2016 (the    Separation Date   ). 

WHEREAS, the Company will provide the Employee with certain severance benefits described below in exchange for the release of any claims that the Employee may have against the Company, including any claims concerning the Employee s employment with the Company or the Employee s termination of employment, and the other covenants by Employee set forth in this Agreement. 

WHEREAS, the Employee accepts these severance benefits in return for the Employee signing a full release of any claims the Employee might have against the Company, including any claims concerning the Employee s employment, the termination of that employment, and any claims for any benefits pursuant to that employment, and in return for the other promises contained in this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the pro  mises and covenants set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which   are   hereby acknowledged,   the Company and the Employee agree as follows:

The Company currently contemplates that the   F  inancial   P  lanning         A  nalysis function   will transition first, followed by Treasury, Accounting  ,   and Investor Rel  ations.  Internal Audit will continue to report to the Employee through the Separation Date.  Except as directed by the Company, throughout the Transition Period, the Employee will otherwise continue to perform the duties he would have performed in the absence of the transition, including but not limited to signing, in his capacity as principal financial officer of Frontier, the two customary certifications to be attached as Exhibits 31.2 and 32 to the Company s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2016.  

2.      Termination of Employment  .  The Employee s employment with the Company will terminate effective on the Separation Date.  

3.      Separation Benefits  .  In consideration of the Employee s execution of this Agreement and his obligations herein and subject to the Employee s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company will provide the following separation benefits:

			 As soon as reasonably practicable following the Separation Date or such earlier date as may be required by applicable state statute or regulation, the Company shall pay the Executive (i) any annual base salary earned but unpaid through the Separation Date,   (ii)   any accrued but unused paid time off through the Separation Date (less applicable deductions), if any  ,    (  i  ii) reimbursement for all un-reimbursed business expenses properly incurred by the Executive in accordance with Company policy prior to the Separation Date; and (i  v  ) all benefits accrued up to the Separation Date, to the extent vested, under all benefit plans of the Company in which the Executive participates in accordance with the terms of such plans and any amounts required to be paid pursuant to applicable law.

3

(c) 
			     Additionally, n  othing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Employee s right under the ADEA to challenge the validity of th  is Agreement in a court of law.  However,   the Employee   nevertheless understands that   in any suit brought   solely   under the ADEA, the Employee would not be entitled to any damages or other relief unless this Agreement and the waivers contained in it were deemed to be unlawful or otherwise invalid.     

6.      No Admission; N  o Sale of Claim  .     The Employee understands and agrees that neither the Company s signing of this Agreement nor any actions taken by the Company toward compliance with the terms of this Agreement constitutes an acknowledgment, admission, or concession by the Company or any other  Released Parties,  as defined in Section 4 hereof that it has breached any contract, committed any tort or violated any federal, state or local statute, constitution, regulation or ordinance, or committed any wrongdoing whatsoever.

Exhibit 10.2 

September 1  , 2016 

Mr.   R. Perley McBride 

Address on file with the Company 

Dear   Perley  , 

On behalf of the senior leadership team, it is my pleasure to confirm our offer of employment for the position of Executive Vice President   Chief Financial Officer (you will join as   Executive Vice President     Chief Financial Officer  -  Elect until   November   4  , 2016  ,   when   John Jureller   steps down as   Executive Vice President         Chief Financial Officer).    Your start date will be   determined upon acceptance  .        The work location for this position will be   Norwalk  , CT  .     Y  ou will be reporting to   Daniel J. McCarthy  ,    President   and Chief Executive Officer.   

Your executive compensation   will   include   four   princip  al   components: 

2)

Cash bonus   under the Frontier Bonus Plan with an annual target incentive of   100%   of your annual base salary of   $  650,000  , which will be paid out   (pro rata based on hire date and in accordance with the Frontier bonus plan)   based on   Frontier   and personal performance.  

3)

Restricted stock awards  ,    of common stock,   are generally granted in the first quarter of each year.  Restricted shares vest in   three   equal annual installments (  one third   per year), commencing   one year from the date of grant  .  The annual target for your position   is   $  1,450,000  .  You will receive dividends, to the extent dividends are declared   on common stock   by the Board of Directors, on all shares, whether vested or unvested.    Our   current annual dividend policy (which is subject to change at the discretion of the Board of Directors) is $0.4  2   per share   of common stock  , declared quarterly in an amount of $0.10  5   per share per quarter.  

4)

Performance Shares   under Frontier   s   Long Term Incentive Plan (  the    LTIP   )  , with an annual performance share target valued at   $  760,000  .  The LTIP target is an annual grant that will be paid out based on   Frontier s   performance over a three year period (initially, 201  7  -201  9  ).  The   current   performance metrics are Operating Cash Flow and Total Shareholder Return.  You will earn performance shares at the end of each three year period based on   Frontier   s performance over the three-year measurement period on the metrics for that award.  Dividends that would have been payable on any earned shares during a three year period will be paid at the end of the three year period.  

As a sign-on bonus, you will be granted   restricted shares     of common stock   having a market value of $  250,000     on the date of grant   (subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee   of the Board of Directors  ).  These shares will vest in   three   equal annual installments (  one third   per year), commencing one year from your start date. 

You will be eligible to receive both immediate and one-year relocation benefits.   The former shall be in the   aggregate   amount of $  75,000  .  The latter shall be paid pursuant to Frontier s   then-current   relocation policy.    We understand that you intend to move   your family   to Connecticut   during the summer of 2017.  In the meantime, you   intend to   rent an apartment in Connecticut for yourself.  The relocation benefits can be used for all relocation-related expenses, including but not limited to household goods transfer, closing costs, and temporary housing. If you leave Frontier within twenty-four months after the date the last relocation funds are paid to you, you will reimburse Frontier for a pro-rated portion of your reimbursed relocation expenses.  This relocation benefit will expire twelve months after your start date.     

You will be eligible for a cash bonus and restricted stock award   in     201  7  ,   with awards paid  /made   in the first quarter of   201  7  .  You will be eligible for an award under the LTIP commencing with the 201  7  -201  9   performance period.  Frontier reserves the right to implement or discontinue executive compensation plans at its own discretion.  Eligibility for any given plan does not guarantee award values since Frontier s Executive Compensation Program is based on performance of   Frontier   and the executive.  Further, awards are subject to the terms and conditions of Frontier s compensation plans. 

If, within one year following a      Change in Control      of   Frontier  , you have a    Separation from Service    either because (a) your employment is terminated by   Frontier     or, as applicable, its successor,   without    Cause    or (b) you   resign   your employment as a result of      Good Reason      (the defined terms in this paragraph shall have the meanings set forth in Annex A hereto; Annex A contains other terms and conditions related to your receipt of Change in Control benefits)  , you shall be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to two years  base salary and bonus target (based on the then current level of salary and bonus target or, if greater, that in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control), all restrictions on restricted shares held by you shall immediately lapse and such restricted shares shall become fully-vested and non-forfeitable and all performance shares granted to you under the LTIP or other performance incentive plan pursuant to a performance-based vesting schedule shall immediately be earned by you and non-forfeitable, with the number of shares earned   based on actual performance as of the Change in Control date (if determinable), otherwise based on target performance  .  The lump sum payment will be made on the      Expiration Date     .    

Y  our health and welfare benefits will begin on your   3  1st   day of employment and  ,   as a Frontier employee, you will be eligible to participate in a full range of benefits.   

This offer and subsequent employment is contingent upon Frontier s receipt of acceptable results of a background check and reference checks including, criminal record check, drug screening, and verification of education, employment and professional references. All drug screens must be completed within 48 hours of receiving this package.  The drug test will be registered by Frontier.

R. Perley McBride                                                      Date 

Annex A 

A    Change in Control    shall be deemed to have occurred: 

(A)  When any    person    as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ), and as used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, including a    group    as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (but excluding   Frontier   and any subsidiary and any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by   Frontier   or any subsidiary (including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee)), directly or indirectly, becomes the    beneficial owner    (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), of securities of   Frontier   representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of   Frontier   s then outstanding securities; or 

(B)  Upon the consummation of any merger or other business combination involving   Frontier  , a sale of substantially all of   Frontier  's assets, liquidation or dissolution of   Frontier   or a combination of the foregoing transactions (the    Transactions   ) other than a Transaction immediately following which the shareholders of   Frontier   immediately prior to the Transaction own, in the same proportion, at least 51% of the voting power, directly or indirectly, of (i) the surviving corporation in any such merger or other business combination; (ii) the purchaser of or successor to   Frontier   s assets; (iii) both the surviving corporation and the purchaser in the event of any combination of Transactions; or (iv) the parent company owning 100% of such surviving corporation, purchaser or both the surviving corporation and the purchaser, as the case may be. 

Cause    mean  s   your (a) willful and continued failure (other than as a result of physical or mental illness or injury) to perform your material duties in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control which continues beyond 10 days after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by   Frontier  , which demand shall identify and describe each failure with sufficient specificity to allow you to respond, (b) willful or intentional conduct that causes material and demonstrable injury, monetary or otherwise, to   Frontier   or (c) conviction of, or a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime constituting (i) a felony under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, or (ii) a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.  For these purposes, no act or failure to act on your part shall be considered  willful  or  intentional  unless it is done, or omitted to be done by you in bad faith and without reasonable belief that your action or inaction was in the best interests of   Frontier  .  Any act or failure to act based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors or based upon the advice of counsel for   Frontier   shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of   Frontier  . 

Good Reason    means:   (i) a material decrease in your base salary, target bonus or long term incentive compensation target from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control for any reason other than Cause; (ii) a material relocation of your principal office location (for this purpose, a relocation more than 50 miles from   Frontier   s   Norwalk  , Connecticut headquarters will be automatically deemed material) or (iii) a material decrease in your responsibilities or authority for any reason other than Cause (and prior to your terminating your employment you provide   Frontier   with notice of the decrease or relocation within 90 days of the occurrence of such condition,   Frontier   does not remedy the condition within 30 days of such notice, and you Separate from Service within two years of the initial occurrence of one or more such conditions)  . 

If it is determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment or distribution by   Frontier   to or for your benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement,  

including without limitation any stock option, restricted stock award, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a    Severance Payment   ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) by reason of being  contingent on a change in ownership or control  of   Frontier  , within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the    Excise Tax   ), then the Severance Payment shall be payable either (i) in full or (ii) as to such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the Severance Payment being subject to the Excise Tax (   Capped Payment   ), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in your receipt on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of economic benefits to you, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. 

Subject to the provisions of immediately preceding paragraph, all determinations required to be made pursuant to this letter agreement, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by you and the amount of such Excise Tax, shall be made by the nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants (the    Accounting Firm   ) used by   Frontier   prior to the Change in Control (or, if such Accounting Firm declines to serve, the Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants selected by you).  The Accounting Firm shall be directed by   Frontier   or you, as applicable, to submit its preliminary determination and detailed supporting calculations to both   Frontier   and you within 15 calendar days after the date of your termination of employment, if applicable, and any other such time or times as may be requested by   Frontier   or you.  If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by you,   Frontier   shall either (x) make payment of the Severance Payment, or (y) reduce the Severance Payment by the amount which, based on the Accounting Firm s determination and calculations, would provide you with the Capped Payment (except that any portion of the Severance Payment that constitutes deferred compensation that is subject to Section 409A shall not be reduced, and its time and form of payment shall not be altered as a result of this process), and pay to you such reduced amount, in each case, less any Excise Taxes, federal, state, and local income and employment withholding taxes and any other amounts required to be deducted or withheld by   Frontier   under applicable statute or regulation.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by you, it shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish you with an opinion that you have substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on your federal, state, local income or other tax return.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and opinion letter shall be paid by   Frontier   in connection with the calculations required by this letter. 

You shall not receive any payments or benefits to which you may be entitled hereunder   related to a Change in Control   unless you agree to execute a release of all then existing claims against   Frontier  , its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents in relation to claims relating to or arising out of your employment or the business of   Frontier  ; provided, however, that any such release shall not bar or prevent you from responding to any litigation or other proceeding initiated by a released party and asserting any claim or counterclaim you have in such litigation or other proceeding as if no such release had been given as to such party, nor shall it bar you from claiming rights that arise under, or that are preserved by, this letter agreement.  To comply with this paragraph, you must sign and return the release within 45 days of the termination of your employment, and you must not revoke it during a seven-day revocation period that begins when the release is signed and returned to   Frontier  .  Then following the expiration of this revocation period, there shall occur the    Expiration Date  ,  which is the 53rd day following the date of termination of your employment. 

To the extent that a payment of Section 409A compensation under this letter agreement is based upon your having a termination of employment,  termination of employment  shall have the same meaning as    Separation from Service    under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code.  In addition, to avoid having such a   S  eparation from   S  ervice occur after your termination of employment, you shall not have (after your termination of employment) any duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with the termination of employment being treated as such a   S  eparation from   S  ervice as of the date of such termination.
