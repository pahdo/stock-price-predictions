  (UNAUDITED) 

In this filing, the name  CERP LLC  refers to the parent holding company, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC, exclusive of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. The words  CERP,   Company,   we,   our,  and  us  refer to Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC, inclusive of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires. 
  Note 1       Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Organization 
  CERP LLC is separately organized as a single-member limited liability company, wholly owned by Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties Holdco, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment Corporation ( CEC  and  Caesars ). CERP owns   six   casino properties: (1) Harrah s Las Vegas, (2) Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino ( Rio Las Vegas ), (3) Flamingo Las Vegas, (4) Harrah s Atlantic City, (5) Paris Las Vegas, and (6) Harrah s Laughlin. CERP also owns The LINQ promenade and Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace Las Vegas ( Octavius Tower ).   Four   of the casino properties, together with The LINQ promenade and Octavius Tower, are concentrated in Las Vegas and represented   72%   and   73%   of consolidated net revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  We view each casino property, including The LINQ promenade, as an operating segment and aggregate such properties into   one   reportable segment. 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of CERP have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable for interim periods, and therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for complete financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The results for the interim periods reflect all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire   2016   fiscal year. 
  GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual amounts could differ.  
  This document should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Consolidation of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC 
  In 2014, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ( CEOC ), CERP, and Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC (collectively, the  Members ) formed Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ( CES ), a services joint venture. CES provides certain corporate and administrative services for the Members  casino properties. CES manages certain assets for the casino properties to which it provides services and it employs certain of the corresponding employees. CES owns, licenses or controls its other assets and uses them to provided services to the Members. Expenses incurred by CES are allocated to the casino properties directly or to the Members according to their allocation percentages, subject to annual review. See   Note 10   for additional information on related party transactions. 
  CES functions as a "pass-through" entity   that serves as an agent on behalf of the Members at a cost-basis, and is reimbursed by the Members for its services performed and costs incurred. CES is not intended to be a profit-generating business enterprise and is designed to have no operating cash flows of its own. Therefore, any net income or loss is generally immaterial and is typically subject to allocation to the Members in the subsequent period. 
  When CES was formed, we determined that it was a variable interest entity ( VIE ), and we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary. We determined that CERP had a controlling financial interest in CES based on our evaluation of several factors,  
  
   7 

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT RESORT PROPERTIES, LLC 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

primarily including that CERP was the most closely associated with CES as CES was designed to maintain working capital risk, and CERP assumed the greatest working capital burden through its initial capital contributions. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we implemented the Financial Accounting Standard Board s (the  FASB ) Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02, which amended Topic 810,   Consolidations  . We applied the amended guidance retrospectively for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto.  
  Under the amended guidance, CERP is not considered the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate CES as CERP individually does not have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary and the consideration of which Member is most closely associated with CES are no longer applicable under the amended guidance as none of the Members is considered a single decision maker and power is not shared among the Members. Additionally, substantially all of the activities of CES do not involve and are not conducted on behalf of any single Member. Therefore, we have deconsolidated CES from our consolidated financial statements. 
  There was   no   cumulative-effect adjustment recognized in accumulated deficit associated with the deconsolidation of CES, and we removed the previously-reported balance in noncontrolling interest. We recorded an initial equity investment in CES of   $43 million  . Our equity method investment in CES was   $55 million   and   $52 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and is included in deferred charges and other.  
  Related Party Relationship 
  As described above, CES provides certain corporate and administrative services for CERP s casino properties. Subsequent to deconsolidation, transactions with CES are no longer eliminated in consolidation and are treated as related party transactions for CERP. See    Services Joint Venture        in   Note 10   for all transactions between us and CES.

Note 2       Litigation 
  The Company is party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business. We do not expect the outcome of any such litigation to have a material effect on our combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, as we do not believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur material losses as a result of such litigation.  
  Birthday Cash Promotional Offer 
  In connection with a Birthday Cash promotional offer by Harrah s Atlantic City, on March 19, 2010, the Superior Court of New Jersey entered a summary judgment in favor of a modified class of approximately 79,000 plaintiffs. The summary judgment found that Harrah s Atlantic City violated the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act. The penalty is $100 per incident, amounting to a potential exposure of up to $7.9 million. In March 2012, the judge held that the damages class, if any, should be based upon the number of individuals who redeemed certificates, not the number of certificates redeemed (as some plaintiffs had multiple certificates). As a result, the potential exposure under the judge s ruling was decreased to $5.2 million. After the case was stayed to wait for a pending case in the New Jersey Supreme Court, the court reopened the case in July 2013. The decision in the New Jersey Supreme Court case clarified two aspects of the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act, which support our contention that the existing judgment against us should be vacated and the case dismissed in our favor. In November 2013, the court denied both parties  motions for reconsideration.     In December 2013, we filed a motion to stay the judgment pending appeal, and in January 2014, the court granted the stay and we filed an appeal. In February 2014, per the court s stay order, we posted into an escrow account the potential exposure under the judge s ruling in the amount of $5.2 million plus attorneys  fees. This amount is included in deferred charges and other in the accompanying balance sheets. No amount has been accrued at this time. On September 9, 2016, by unanimous decision of a three-judge panel, we prevailed on our appeal. On September 15, 2016, plaintiffs filed a letter brief asking the appellate court to reconsider that decision. This request remains pending. The Company continues to believe that the merits of its legal position are strong and will continue to defend against the lawsuit vigorously. 
  CEOC Noteholder Disputes 
  On   August 4, 2014  ,   Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, solely in its capacity as successor Indenture Trustee for the 10.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2018 issued by CEOC (the  CEOC 10.00% Second-Priority Notes ), on behalf of itself and, it alleges, derivatively on behalf of CEOC  , filed a lawsuit in   the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware   against   CEC and CEOC, Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ( CGP ), Caesars Acquisition Company ( CAC ), CERP, CES, Eric Hession, Gary Loveman, Jeffrey D. Benjamin, David Bonderman, Kelvin L. Davis, Marc C. Rowan, David B. Sambur, and Eric Press  .   The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of contract, intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and corporate waste.   The lawsuit seeks (1) an award of money damages; (2) to void certain transfers, the earliest of which dates back to 2010; (3) an injunction directing the recipients of the assets in these transactions to return them to CEOC; (4) a declaration that CEC remains liable under the parent guarantee formerly applicable to the CEOC 10.00% Second-Priority Notes; (5) to impose a constructive trust or equitable lien on the transferred assets; and (6) an award to plaintiffs for their attorneys  fees and costs.     CERP believes this lawsuit is without merit and is defending itself vigorously  .   A motion to dismiss this action was filed by CEC and other defendants in September 2014, and the motion was argued in December 2014.     During the pendency of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the action has been automatically stayed with respect to CEOC. The motion to dismiss with respect to CEC was denied on March 18, 2015. In a Verified Supplemental Complaint filed on August 3, 2015, the plaintiff stated that due to CEOC s bankruptcy filing, the continuation of all claims was stayed pursuant to the bankruptcy except for Claims II, III, and X. These are claims against CEC only, for breach of contract in respect of the release of the parent guarantee formerly applicable to the CEOC 10.00% Second-Priority Notes, for declaratory relief in respect of the release of this guarantee, and for violations of the Trust Indenture Act in respect of the release of this guarantee. Fact discovery in the case is complete, and

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

cross-motions for summary judgment have been filed by the parties. On October 5, 2016, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago (the  Bankruptcy Court ) granted CEOC s motion for a stay of this proceeding (and others). The stay will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the CEOC reorganization plan, (b) the termination of the restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders, or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court.    
  On   November 25, 2014  ,   UMB Bank ( UMB ), as successor indenture trustee for CEOC s 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the  CEOC 8.50% Senior Secured Notes )  , filed a verified complaint in   Delaware Chancery Court   against   CERP, CEC, CEOC, CAC, CGP, CES, and against individual past and present CEC board members Loveman, Benjamin, Bonderman, Davis, Press, Rowan, Sambur, Hession, Colvin, Kleisner, Swann, Williams, Housenbold, Cohen, Stauber, and Winograd  ,   alleging generally that defendants improperly stripped CEOC of certain assets, wrongfully effected a release of CEC s parent guarantee of the CEOC 8.50% Senior Secured Notes and committed other wrongs  .   Among other things, UMB asked the court to appoint a receiver over CEOC. In addition, the suit pleads claims for fraudulent conveyances/transfers, insider preferences, illegal dividends, declaratory judgment (for breach of contract as regards to the parent guarantee and also as to certain covenants in the bond indenture), tortious interference with contract, breach of fiduciary duty, usurpation of corporate opportunities, and unjust enrichment, and seeks monetary, equitable and declaratory relief.     The lawsuit has been automatically stayed with respect to CEOC during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. Pursuant to a Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement entered into by CEC and CEOC with certain creditors (as amended, the  First Lien Bond RSA ), the lawsuit also has been stayed in its entirety (including with respect to CERP), with the consent of all of the parties to it.    
  Although the claims and demands described above against CERP are not currently being litigated, the Company believes that such claims and demands are without merit and is prepared to defend itself vigorously. The claims against CEOC have been stayed due to the Chapter 11 process, and the actions against CEC also have been stayed. Should the actions against CEC ultimately resume, CERP believes there is a reasonably possible likelihood of an adverse outcome as to CEC. We are not able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible losses should any of the noteholder disputes ultimately be resolved against CEC. Should any of the noteholder disputes ultimately be resolved through litigation outside of the financial restructuring of CEOC, and should a court find in favor of the claimants in any of these noteholder disputes, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In addition to the ongoing actions and uncertainties described above, certain of our affiliates, including CEC, are subject to certain liquidity concerns and other uncertainties. While it is possible that such concerns and uncertainties may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, because CERP is a separate legal entity and financial structure and its properties are managed by CES, we do not believe such a scenario is likely.    
  Report of Bankruptcy Examiner 
  The Bankruptcy Court engaged an examiner to investigate possible claims CEOC might have against CEC and/or other entities and individuals. On March 15, 2016, the examiner released his report, which set forth conclusions on the relative strength of certain claims involved in the CEOC bankruptcy. The examiner calculates an estimated range of potential damages for these potential claims from   $716 million   to   $1.3 billion   for CERP, and such calculation does not account for probability of success, likelihood of collection, or the time or cost of litigation. 
  The report identifies a variety of potential claims against CEC and/or other entities and certain individuals related to a number of transactions dating back to 2009, including potential fraudulent transfer and breach of fiduciary duties claims relating to the transaction pursuant to which CERP acquired The LINQ promenade and Octavius Tower from CEOC. The examiner notes that the difficulty of quantifying damage might suggest that a court could order the return of Octavius Tower to CEOC. He further opines that there is at least a reasonable case that CERP will not be able to establish that it was a good faith transferee in this transaction and, under these circumstances, CERP would not be entitled to a lien for the consideration it did pay (cash and bonds valued by the examiner at   $129 million  ), and would instead receive an unsecured claim for that amount in CEOC s Chapter 11 proceeding. However, the examiner further notes that returning Octavius Tower would be problematic from the perspective of the lenders who expressly bargained for inclusion of Octavius Tower as part of their collateral package, and, based on available evidence, it appears that CERP s lenders would be good faith transferees entitled to the benefit of their lien.  
  Most of the examiner s findings are premised on his view that CEOC was  insolvent  at the time of the applicable transactions and that CEOC did not receive fair value for assets transferred. While this report was prepared at the request of the Bankruptcy Court, none of the findings included therein are legally binding on the Bankruptcy Court or any party.

We and CEC contest the examiner s findings with respect to the transaction pursuant to which The LINQ promenade and Octavius Tower were transferred to CERP, including his findings that CEOC was insolvent at relevant times, that there were breaches of fiduciary duty, that there were fraudulent transfers and that CEOC did not receive fair value for assets transferred, and as to the calculation of damages. 
  National Retirement Fund 
  In January 2015, a majority of the Trustees of the National Retirement Fund ( NRF ), a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan, voted to expel the five indirect subsidiaries of CEC, including the subsidiary that owns Harrah s Atlantic City, which were required to make contributions to the legacy plan of the NRF (the  Five Employers ). The NRF contended that the financial condition of the Five Employers  controlled group (the  CEC Controlled Group ) and CEOC s then-potential bankruptcy presented an  actuarial risk  to the plan because, depending on the outcome of any CEOC bankruptcy proceedings, CEC might no longer be liable to the plan for any partial or complete withdrawal liability. As a result, the NRF claimed that the expulsion of the Five Employers constituted a complete withdrawal of the CEC Controlled Group from the plan. CEOC, in its bankruptcy proceedings, has to date not rejected the contribution obligations to the NRF of any of its subsidiary employers. The NRF has advised the CEC Controlled Group (which includes CERP) that the expulsion of the Five Employers has triggered a joint and several withdrawal liability with a present value of approximately $360 million, payable in 80 quarterly payments of about $6 million. 
  Prior to the NRF s vote to expel the Five Employers, the Five Employers reiterated their commitments to remain in the plan and not seek rejection of any collective bargaining agreement in which the obligation to contribute to NRF exists. The Five Employers were current with respect to pension contributions at the time of their expulsion, and are current with respect to pension contributions as of today pursuant to the Standstill Agreement referred to below. 
  We have opposed the various NRF expulsion actions. 
  On January 8, 2015, prior to the NRF s vote to expel the Five Employers, CEC filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  S.D.N.Y. ) against the NRF and its Board of Trustees, seeking a declaratory judgment that they did not have the authority to expel the Five Employers and thus allegedly trigger withdrawal liability for the CEC Controlled Group (the  CEC Action ). On December 25, 2015, the District Judge entered an order dismissing the CEC Action on the ground that CEC s claims in this action must first be arbitrated under ERISA. CEC has appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
  On March 6 and March 27, 2015, CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries filed in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings two motions to void (a) the purported expulsion of the Five Employers and based thereon the alleged triggering of withdrawal liability for the non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group, and (b) a notice and payment demand for quarterly payments of withdrawal liability subsequently made by the NRF to certain non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group, respectively, on the ground that each of these actions violated the automatic stay (the  362 Motions ). On November 12, 2015, Bankruptcy Judge Goldgar issued a decision denying the 362 Motions on the ground that the NRF s actions were directed at non-debtors and therefore did not violate the automatic stay. CEOC has appealed this decision to the federal district court in Chicago. 
  On March 6, 2015, CEOC commenced an adversary proceeding against the NRF and its Board of Trustees in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the  Adversary Proceeding ). On March 11, 2015, CEOC filed a motion in that Adversary Proceeding to extend the automatic stay in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings to apply to the NRF s expulsion of the Five Employers (the  105 Motion ). Judge Goldgar has not yet decided the 105 Motion. 
  On March 20, 2015, CEC, CEOC and CERP, on behalf of themselves and others, entered into a Standstill Agreement with the NRF and its Board of Trustees that, among other things, stayed each member of the CEC Controlled Group s purported obligation to commence making quarterly payments of withdrawal liability and instead required the Five Employers to continue making monthly contribution payments to the NRF, unless and until each of the 362 Motions and the 105 Motion had been denied. As the 105 Motion has not yet been decided, the Standstill Agreement remains in effect. 
  If both the 105 Motion and CEC s appeal of the CEC Action are denied, then CEC could be required to pay to the NRF joint and several withdrawal liability with a present value of approximately $360 million, payable in 80 quarterly payments of about $6 million each, while CEC simultaneously arbitrates whether the NRF and its Board of Trustees had the authority to expel the Five Employers and trigger withdrawal liability for the CEC Controlled Group.

Also, on March 18, 2015, the NRF and its fund manager commenced a collection action in the S.D.N.Y. against CEC, CERP and all non-debtor members of the CEC Controlled Group for the payment of the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability, which the NRF contended was due on March 15, 2015 (the  NRF Action ). On December 25, 2015, the District Judge denied the defendants  motion to dismiss the NRF Action on the ground that the arguments raised by the defendants must first be arbitrated under ERISA. On February 26, 2016, the NRF and its fund manager filed a motion for summary judgment against CEC and CERP for payment of the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability and for interest, liquidated damages, attorneys  fees and costs. On May 5, 2016, the Magistrate Judge recommended in his report and recommendation ( Report and Recommendation ) that the NRF Action plaintiffs  motion for summary judgment be granted on the ground that the further arguments raised by CEC and CERP must first be arbitrated under ERISA. On May 19, 2016, CEC and CERP filed their objections to the Report and Recommendation (the  Objections ). On June 2, 2016, the NRF Action plaintiffs filed their response to the Objections. The District Judge has not yet ruled on the Objections. If the District Judge adopts the Magistrate Judge s Report and Recommendation, then a judgment could be entered against CEC and CERP for approximately $8 million comprising the first quarterly payment of withdrawal liability referred to above, interest and liquidated damages under ERISA, which amount would be paid or bonded pending an appeal. 
  We believe our legal arguments against the actions undertaken by NRF are strong and will pursue them vigorously, and will defend vigorously against the claims raised by the NRF in the NRF Action. Since settlement discussions with the NRF are continuing and no material discovery has yet been performed with respect to any of the above actions, we cannot currently provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of the matters at issue. 
   
  Note 3       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
  During 2016, we adopted Account Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis     (see   Note 1  ). 
  The FASB issued the following authoritative guidance amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  
  New Developments 
  Statement of Cash Flows - August 2016  :   Amended guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 
  Income Taxes - October 2016  :   Amended guidance addresses intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires the recognition of any related income tax consequences when such transfers occur. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 
  Consolidation - October 2016  :   Amended consolidation guidance addresses how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and including interim periods within those fiscal years. During 2016 we adopted ASU No. 2015-2 and are required to apply updated amendments retrospectively to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which amendments in ASU No. 2015-2 were applied. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Previously Disclosed 
  Revenue Recognition - May 2014 (amended May 2016)  :   Created a new Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The new guidance is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for United States GAAP applicable to revenue transactions. This guidance provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Existing industry guidance will be eliminated, including revenue recognition guidance specific to the gaming industry. In addition, interim and annual disclosures will be substantially revised. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We expect to adopt this standard effective January 1, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements; however, we expect that the accounting for the Total Rewards customer loyalty program and casino promotional allowances will be affected. 
  Going Concern - August 2014  :   Amended the existing requirements for disclosing information about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance explicitly requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have any impact on our financial statements. 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments - January 2016  :   Amended certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other things, they require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income and simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted on certain provisions. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 
  Leases - February 2016  :   The new guidance requires lease obligations to be recognized on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance should be implemented for the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach which includes optional practical expedients primarily focused on leases that commenced before the effective date, including continuing to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous guidance, unless the lease is modified. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

    Primarily in the first quarter of 2016, the depreciation of certain assets was accelerated due to their removal and replacement in connection with property renovations at Harrah s Las Vegas and Flamingo Las Vegas. 
      
  Note 5       Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    

Note 6       Commitments and Contingencies    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we have not entered into any material contractual commitments outside of the ordinary course of business that have materially changed our contractual commitments as compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  CEOC and certain of its United States subsidiaries filed an amended plan of reorganization on October 20, 2016 with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago that contemplates, among other things, that CEC would give the new entity that will operate CEOC s properties at the time of CEOC s emergence from bankruptcy a call right to purchase Harrah s Atlantic City and Harrah s Laughlin from CERP. No amounts have been recorded for this contemplated transaction because the transaction is not legally enforceable at this time and is subject to the terms of the CERP Notes and CERP Credit Facility agreements.

____________________ 
            (1)    
    Interest rate is fixed, except where noted. 
               (2)   
    Variable interest rate for amounts currently borrowed is determined by adding LIBOR to a base rate of 6.00%. 
               (3)   
    Variable interest rate calculated as a fixed rate plus the greater of LIBOR or a 1% floor. The rate is set at the 1% floor as of September 30, 2016. 
       
  Current Portion of Long-Term Debt 
  The current portion of long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016  , includes principal payments on the Senior Secured Loan, other unsecured borrowings, and capital lease obligations that are expected to be paid within 12 months.  
  Although there is   no   amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  , borrowings under the CERP Revolving Credit Facility are subject to separate note agreements executed based on the provisions of the applicable credit facility agreement, and each note has a contractual maturity of less than one year. The applicable credit facility agreement has a contractual maturity of greater than one year, and we have the ability to rollover the outstanding principal balance on a long-term basis; however, we generally intend to repay any principal balance outstanding at the end of the quarter within the subsequent 12 month period. Amounts borrowed under the CERP Revolving Credit Facility are intended to satisfy short term liquidity needs and are classified as current. 
  We believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance, our cash flows from operations, and/or financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures, and to fund debt service during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
  Fair     Value 
  The fair value of debt has been estimated based on the borrowing rates available as of   September 30, 2016  , for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our debt is primarily classified within level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

____________________ 
            (1)   
    Debt principal payments are estimated amounts based on maturity dates and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Interest payments are estimated based on the forward-looking LIBOR curve. Actual payments may differ from these estimates. 
     Restrictive Covenant  s 
  The CERP Notes and CERP Credit Facility include negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, and contain customary events of default, subject to customary or agreed-upon exceptions, baskets and thresholds (including equity cure provisions in the case of the CERP Credit Facilities). 
  The CERP Credit Facility also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and requires that we maintain a senior secured leverage ratio of no more than   8.00   to 1.00, which is the ratio of first lien senior secured net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted as defined in the Credit Facility. 
  CERP has pledged a significant portion of its assets as collateral under the notes and facilities. The CERP Notes are co-issued, as well as fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by CERP LLC and each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries on a senior secured basis. Although CERP s subsidiaries are allowed to make distributions to CERP LLC, restrictions under CERP s lending arrangements generally prevent the distribution of cash to CEC; except for certain restricted payments. 
   
  Note 8       Casino Promotional Allowances    
  The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as casino promotional allowances. The estimated cost of providing such casino promotional allowances is included in casino expense.

Note 9       Income Taxes    

We classify reserves for tax uncertainties within accrued expenses and deferred credits and other in our consolidated condensed balance sheets, separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities. 
  The effective tax rate for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   differed from the expected US tax rate of 35% primarily due to the projected tax benefit of federal tax credits. The effective tax rate for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   differed from the expected US tax rate of 35% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of state taxes and nondeductible expenses.  
  We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   will not materially change within the next 12 months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that an adequate provision has been made for such matters, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such matters could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these matters are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a favorable impact on earnings. 
  CERP is included in the CEC consolidated tax return filing.  We have allocated taxes based upon the separate return method for CERP financial reporting purposes. Historically, we have treated taxes paid or refunds received by CEC for CERP as equity contributions or distributions. Although there is no formal tax sharing agreement in place between the CERP entities and CEC for federal income tax purposes, CERP may make payments to CEC or its subsidiaries for federal, state, or local taxes that would have been paid if CERP was a standalone taxpayer. 
  The amounts recorded as tax assets, tax liabilities, tax reserves and tax provision reflect CERP s conclusion that certain challenged transactions identified in Note 1 were negotiated in good faith and the CEC tax consolidated group received fair value for assets transferred. These amounts could change if litigation and potential claims related to the challenged transactions are resolved unfavorably. If that occurs, changes may be necessary to reduce tax assets and increase tax liabilities, tax reserves and the tax provision recorded in CERP s financial statements. Such changes could be material. Management cannot predict the various potential outcomes of pending litigation and other potential claims, thus cannot estimate the reasonably possible amount or range of effects, if any, to the recorded tax accounts.

Note 10       Related Party Transactions 

Services Joint Venture    
  As described in   Note 1  , CES provides certain corporate and administrative services to CERP and its other Members, and the costs of these services are allocated among the Members. CES   serves as an agent on behalf of the Members at a cost-basis. CERP reimburses CES for the services it performs and the costs it incurs. 
  CEOC Shared Services Agreement 
  Pursuant to a shared services agreement, CEOC provides CEC with certain corporate and administrative services, and the costs of these services are allocated among us and all of CEC s operating subsidiaries. In May 2014, the Members entered into a services joint venture, CES, and the Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement. Certain of these corporate and administrative services are now provided by CES (see   Note 1  ). 
  Transactions with CEC 
  Employee Benefit Plans 
  CEC maintains a defined contribution savings and retirement plan in which employees of CERP may participate. The plan provides for, among other things, pre-tax and after-tax contributions by employees. Under the plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 50% of their eligible earnings (subject to certain IRS and plan limits). In addition, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements receive benefits through the multi-employer pension plans sponsored by the organization in which they are a member. The expenses related to contributions made to the plans on their behalf are allocated to the properties at which they are employed. 
  Equity Incentive Awards 
  CEC maintains an equity incentive awards plan under which CEC may issue time-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards to CERP employees. Although awards under the plan result in the issuance of shares of CEC, because CERP is a consolidated subsidiary of CEC, the amounts are included in CERP share-based compensation expense as a component of total compensation for CERP employees. During the second quarter 2016, CEC implemented the Account Standards Update No. 2106-09, which amended Topic 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  . CEC applied the amended guidance using a modified retrospective transition method, but there was no material effect on CERP s financial statements.

Transactions with Sponsors and their Affiliates 
  The members of Hamlet Holdings LLC ( Hamlet Holdings ) are comprised of individuals affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC and affiliates of TPG Capital LP (collectively, the  Sponsors ). As of   September 30, 2016  , Hamlet Holdings beneficially owned the majority of CEC s common stock. 
  Reimbursements and Expenses allocated to CERP 
  CEC has a services agreement with the Sponsors relating to the provision of financial and strategic advisory services and consulting services. The Sponsors granted a waiver of the monitoring fees for management services; however, CEC reimburses the Sponsors for expenses they incur related to these management services. A portion of the reimbursed expenses are allocated to CERP.  
  Sponsors  Portfolio Companies 
  We may engage in transactions with companies owned or controlled by affiliates of the Sponsors in the normal course of business. Amounts paid to the Sponsors  portfolio companies are included in the table above and we believe such transactions are conducted at fair value.  
  In addition, certain entities affiliated with or under the control of our Sponsors may from time to time transact in and hold our debt securities, and participate in any modifications of such instruments on terms available to any other holder of our debt. 
  Other Related Party Transactions 
  Lease Agreements    
  We lease Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace to CEOC for approximately   $35 million   per year and gaming space in The LINQ promenade to CGP for approximately   $15 million   per year pursuant to separate lease agreements that both expire April 2026. 
  LINQ Access and Parking Easement Lease Agreement 
  Under the LINQ Access and Parking Easement lease agreement, CEOC leases the parking lot behind The LINQ promenade and The LINQ Hotel   Casino to CERP and CGP. Pursuant to the lease agreement, which expires in April 2028, CERP pays approximately   $1 million   annually, subject to a 3% annual increase. 
  Service Provider Fee 
  CEOC, CERP and CGP have a shared services agreement under which CERP and CGP pay for certain indirect corporate support costs. CEOC is authorized to charge CERP for an amount equal to   21.8%   of unallocated corporate support costs.  
  World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) Agreements 
  Pursuant to multiple agreements with Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. ( CIE ), CERP is allowed to host various WSOP events in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, including the annual Main Event at the Rio Las Vegas. CERP pays CIE   $2 million   per year for the right to host WSOP tournaments in Las Vegas and pays to host a certain number of WSOP circuit events in Atlantic City. These agreements are in effect until September 1, 2017, unless terminated earlier pursuant to each agreement s terms.  
  Total Rewards Loyalty Program 
  CEOC s customer loyalty program, Total Rewards, offers incentives to customers from their spending related to on-property entertainment expenses, including gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping at our and CEOC s resort properties located in the U.S. and Canada. Under the program, customers are able to accumulate, or bank, Reward Credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program. The Reward Credit balance will be forfeited if the customer does not earn a Reward Credit over the prior six-month period. As a result of the ability of the customer to bank the Reward Credits, CEOC estimates the cost of fulfilling the redemption of Reward Credits, after consideration of estimated forfeitures (referred to as  breakage ) based upon the cost of historical redemptions. The estimated value of Reward Credits is expensed as the Reward Credits are earned by customers and is included in direct casino expense. The total estimated cost is accrued by CEOC, with the incremental charges related to our casino properties included in due to affiliates, net in the accompanying balance sheets.

  Centralized Transactions 
  In addition, the Company participates with other CEC subsidiaries in marketing, purchasing, insurance, employee benefit and other programs that are defined, negotiated and managed on a company-wide basis.

Ongoing Property Renovations 
             
    We perform ongoing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our capital spending totaled   $28 million   and   $87 million  , respectively. Estimated total capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be between   $150 million   and   $165 million  , including funds for these projects that are in process. Our most significant construction projects that are planned or in process as of   September 30, 2016   include the following (in millions):

In connection with ongoing property renovation projects primarily at Harrah s Las Vegas (which was substantially completed as of   September 30, 2016  ), Paris Las Vegas, and Flamingo Las Vegas, the depreciation of certain assets was accelerated due to their removal and replacement. We recognized additional depreciation and amortization expense of   $8 million   and   $32 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
     Net Revenues 
              
    Rooms revenue was negatively affected by scheduled room renovations at Harrah s Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas, which resulted in over   32,000   room nights out of service during the   third quarter of 2016   and over   90,000   room nights during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
                
    Casino revenues increased during the   third quarter of 2016   primarily due to higher gaming volumes in Nevada, as well as favorable gaming hold. Casino revenues declined for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to declines in gaming volumes, primarily in Atlantic City.  
                
    Other revenues increased   $10 million   and   $11 million   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, driven by increases at Rio Las Vegas, which contributed to higher entertainment revenue. 
     Operating Expenses 
             
    Operating expenses were relatively flat in   2016   compared with the prior year periods except for increases of   $10 million  , or   18.9%  , in depreciation, amortization, and other for the third quarter of 2016 and   $46 million  , or   29.9%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The increases were due primarily to the property renovations discussed above, as well as increased depreciation and amortization expense related to the Atlantic City Conference Center of   $4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
     Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   zero  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   50.0%   and   39.4%  , respectively. See   Note 9   for a detailed discussion of income taxes and the effective tax rate. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See   Note 3   for discussions of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  For information on critical accounting policies, see  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in MD A of the 2015 10-K. There have been no changes to these policies during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity Discussion and Analysis 
  As discussed in   Note 1  , effective January 1, 2016, we implemented the Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-02, which amended Topic 810,   Consolidations  , and under the new guidance, we deconsolidated Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ( CES ) from our financial statements. Because the cash and cash equivalents held by CES was not available to satisfy CERP s obligations, the deconsolidation of CES did not have an effect on CERP s ongoing liquidity or ability to satisfy its obligations. 
  We generated a net loss of   $2 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which includes the impact of non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and other expense of   $200 million   during the period and changes in deferred income taxes of   $14 million  . Other than accelerated depreciation and amortization expense compared with the prior year (described above), our operating activities were stable and yielded operating cash flows of   $299 million  , an increase of   $30 million  , or   11.2%  , compared with the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to improvement in operating results in   2016  , including the increase in net revenues discussed above, the timing of payments for amounts due to affiliates, and largely offsetting working capital fluctuations. 
  Capital expenditures were   $87 million   during the 2016 period in support of our ongoing property renovations, a decrease of   $15 million  , or   14.7%  , compared with the prior year period. In addition to acquisitions of property and equipment, we also have commitments related to our long-term debt and, from time to time, our revolving credit facility. In 2016, we incurred   $297 million   of interest expense, of which   $239 million   was paid in cash, and repaid   $108 million   net primarily on our revolving line of credit (  $173 million   in payments less   $65 million   in revolver draws). 
  We are highly leveraged and a significant amount of our liquidity needs are for debt service and related interest payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $4.6 billion   face value of indebtedness outstanding including capital lease obligations (see   Note 7  ).  

____________________ 
            (1)   
    Debt principal payments are estimated amounts based on maturity dates and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Interest payments are estimated based on the forward-looking LIBOR curve. Actual payments may differ from these estimates. 
     We believe that our cash flows from operations are sufficient to cover our planned capital expenditures for ongoing property renovations during the remainder of 2016, as well as remaining 2016 estimated interest and principal payments due on our long-term debt totaling   $200 million  . However, if needed, our existing cash and cash equivalents of   $247 million   and availability under our revolving credit facility of   $270 million  , both as of   September 30, 2016  , are available to further support CERP s operations during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictions under our lending arrangements generally prevent the distribution of cash to CEC, except for certain restricted payments. 
  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, to fund our liquidity needs and pay our indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our liquidity needs or pay our indebtedness when it is due, we may have to reduce or delay refurbishment and expansion projects, reduce expenses, sell assets, or attempt to restructure our debt. Any such actions could negatively impact our competitive position and revenue generation. 
  Related-Party Transactions 
  We participate with other CEC subsidiaries in marketing, purchasing, insurance, employee benefit, and other programs that are defined, negotiated and managed on a company-wide basis. The Company believes that participating in these consolidated programs is beneficial in comparison to the cost and terms for similar programs that it could negotiate on a standalone basis. For a more complete description of the nature and extent of these and other transactions with related parties, see   Note 10  . 
  
   23 

Other Obligations and Commitments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our other known contractual obligations, which are set forth in the table included in Item 7 in our   2015   10-K. 
  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) is presented as a measure of the Company s performance. Property EBITDA is defined as revenues less property operating expenses and is comprised of net income/(loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax (benefit)/provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) corporate expenses, and (v) certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. In evaluating Property EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Property EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items.  
  Property EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income/(loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP   )). Property EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Property EBITDA is included because management uses Property EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Property EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.
