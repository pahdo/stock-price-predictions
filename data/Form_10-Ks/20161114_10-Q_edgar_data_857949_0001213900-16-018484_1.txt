NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

China
Green Agriculture, Inc. (the  Company ,  Parent Company  or  Green Nevada ), through its subsidiaries,
is engaged in the research, development, production, distribution and sale of humic acid-based compound fertilizer, compound fertilizer,
blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, highly-concentrated water-soluble fertilizers and mixed
organic-inorganic compound fertilizer and the development, production and distribution of agricultural products.  

Unless
the context indicates otherwise, as used in the notes to the financial statements of the Company, the following are the references
herein of all the subsidiaries of the Company (i) Green Agriculture Holding Corporation ( Green New Jersey ), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Green Nevada, incorporated in the State of New Jersey; (ii) Shaanxi TechTeam Jinong Humic Acid Product Co., Ltd.
( Jinong ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green New Jersey organized under the laws of the PRC; (iii) Xi an Hu
County Yuxing Agriculture Technology Development Co., Ltd. ( Yuxing ), a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE )
in the in the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ) controlled by Jinong through a series of contractual agreements;
(iv) Beijing Gufeng Chemical Products Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jinong in the PRC ( Gufeng ), and (v)
Beijing Tianjuyuan Fertilizer Co., Ltd., Gufeng s wholly-owned subsidiary in the PRC ( Tianjuyuan ).   

On
June 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Jinong, entered into strategic acquisition agreements and a series
of contractual agreements with the shareholders of the following six companies that are organized under the laws of the PRC and
would be deemedVIEs: Shaanxi Lishijie Agrochemical Co., Ltd., Songyuan Jinyangguang Sannong Service Co., Ltd., Shenqiu County
Zhenbai Agriculture Co., Ltd., Weinan City Linwei District Wangtian Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., Aksu Xindeguo Agricultural
Materials Co., Ltd., and Xinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology co., Ltd. (collectively hereafter referred to
as  the VIE Companies. )  

The
Company s corporate structure as of September 30, 2016 is set forth in the diagram below:  

NOTE
2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Principle
of consolidation   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Green New Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, Tianjuyuan, Yuxing and the VIE Companies. All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

VIE
assessment   

A
VIE is an entity (1) that has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other entities, (2) where the group of equity holders does not have the power to direct the activities
of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, or the obligation to absorb the entity s
expected losses or the right to receive the entity s expected residual returns, or both, or (3) where the voting rights
of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to receive
the expected residual returns of the entity, or both, and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or
are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. In order to determine if an entity is considered
a VIE, the Company first perform a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding its assessments,
including, but not limited to, the design of the entity, the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along
to its interest holders, the rights of the parties, and the purpose of the arrangement. If the Company cannot conclude after a
qualitative analysis whether an entity is a VIE, it performs a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis considered the
design of the entity, the risks that cause variability, the purpose for which the entity was created, and the variability that
the entity was designed to pass along to its variable interest holders. When the primary beneficiary could not be identified through
a qualitative analysis, we used internal cash flow models to compute and allocate expected losses or expected residual returns
to each variable interest holder based upon the relative contractual rights and preferences of each interest holder in the VIE s
capital structure.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the
estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results.  

Cash
and cash equivalents and concentration of cash   

For statement of cash flows purposes, the
Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit with state owned banks in the Peoples Republic of China
( PRC ) and banks in the United States, and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less,
when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains large sums of cash in three major banks in China. The aggregate
cash in such accounts and on hand as of September 30,2016 and June 30, 2016 were $108,121,059 and $102,896,486, respectively.
 The Company had $107,888,999 and
$102,728,991 in cash in bank in China, and also had $232,060 and $167,495 in cash in two banks in the United States as of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Cash overdraft as of balance sheet date will be reflected as liabilities in the balance
sheet. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on
its cash in bank accounts.  

Accounts
receivable   

The
Company's policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management regularly reviews the
composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment
patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves at each year-end. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off through
a charge to the valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had accounts receivable of $116,563,778
and $117,055,376, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,006,879 and $397,123, respectively. The Company adopts no policy
to accept product returns post to the sales delivery.  

Inventories   

Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) or market. Inventories consist of raw materials, work
in process, finished goods and packaging materials. The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods
and establishes reserves when determined necessary.  

Deferred
asset   

Deferred
assets represent amounts that the distributors owed to the Company in their marketing efforts and developing standard stores to
expand the Company s products  competitiveness and market shares. The amount owed to the Company to assist its distributors
will be expensed over three years which is the term as stated in the cooperation agreement, as long as the distributors are actively
selling the Company s products. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company amortized $7,274,334
and $9,712,715, respectively, of the deferred assets. If a distributor breaches, defaults, or terminates the agreement with the
Company within the three-year period, the outstanding unamortized portion of the amount owed will become payable to the Company
immediately. The Company s Chairman, Mr. Li, guaranteed to the Company of amounts remaining unpaid due from distributors.  

The
deferred assets consist of items inside the distributors  stores such as furniture, racks, cabinets, and display units,
and items outside or attached to the distributors  stores such as signage and billboards. These types of assets would be
capitalized as fixed assets if the Company actually owned the stores or utilized the assets for its own operations. These assets
would also be capitalized as leasehold improvements if the Company leased these stores from the distributors. Therefore, the Company
believes that under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these types of assets purchases are properly capitalized.
In addition, the Company believes that these assets are properly classified as deferred assets because if a distributor breaches,
defaults, or terminates the agreement with the Company within a three-year period, a proportionate amount expended by the Company
is to be repaid by the distributor. The Chairman of the Board of directors of the Company guaranteed to the Company of amounts
remaining unpaid due from distributors.  

The
assets inside the distributors  stores are custom made to fit the layout of each individual store and the signage and billboards
are also custom designed to fit the specific location. The assets were purchased by the Company directly from the manufacturers
and installed in the distributors  stores. The Company wants to maintain control over the quality of the items being purchased
as well as making them uniform among all the distributor locations.  

Intangible
Assets   

The
Company records intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group at fair value. Intangible assets with definitive
lives are amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute
directly or indirectly to the entity s future cash flows. The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least
annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever
any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value.  

Customer
deposits   

Payments
received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits. When all
revenue recognition criteria are met, the customer deposits are recognized as revenue. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
the Company had customer deposits of $4,420,357 and $8,578,341, respectively.  

Earnings
per share   

Basic
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
stock options and stock awards.  

The
components of basic and diluted earnings per share consist of the following:  

Recent
accounting pronouncements    

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease
recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,  Leases (FAS 13) . ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting , to simplify several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this newly issued guidance to its consolidated
financial statements.  

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU
2016-10 ), which clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the licensing
implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The new guidance is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, which will be our
interim period beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-11,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of
Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-06 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  ( ASU
2016-11 ), which clarifies revenue and expense recognition for freight costs, accounting for shipping and handling fees and
costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, which will be our interim period beginning January
1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting
periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU
2016-12 ), which amends the guidance in the new revenue standard on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of
sales tax, and transition. The amendments are intended to address implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients
to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, which will be our interim period beginning January
1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting
periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
regarding ASC Topic 230  Statement of Cash Flows.  This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with
the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company's present or future financial statements.

convertible notes payable in the aggregate amount of RMB 51,000,000 ($7,675,500) with a term of three years and an annual interest
rate of 3%. The convertible notes take priority over the preferred stock and common stock of Jinong, and any other class or series
of capital stocks Jinong issues in the future in terms of interests and payments in the event of any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of Jinong. On or after the third anniversary of the issuance date of the note, noteholders may request Jinong to
process the note conversion to convert the note into shares of the Company s common stock. The notes cannot be converted
prior to the mature date. The per share conversion price of the notes is the higher of the following: (i) $5.00 per share or (ii)

NOTE
10   TAXES PAYABLE   

Enterprise
Income Tax   

Effective
January 1, 2008, the Enterprise Income Tax ( EIT ) law of the PRC replaced the tax laws for Domestic Enterprises ( DEs )
and Foreign Invested Enterprises ( FIEs ). The EIT rate of 25% replaced the 33% rate that was applicable to both DEs
and FIEs. The two year tax exemption and three year 50% tax reduction tax holiday for production-oriented FIEs was eliminated.
Since January 1, 2008, Jinong became subject to income tax in China at a rate of 15% as a high-tech company, as a result of the
expiration of its tax exemption on December 31, 2007. Accordingly, it made provision for income taxes for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $987,512 and $1,220,708, respectively, which is mainly due to the operating income from Jinong.
Gufeng is subject to 25% EIT rate and thus it made provision for income taxes of $307,735 and $556,733 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Value-Added
Tax   

All
of the Company s fertilizer products that are produced and sold in the PRC were subject to a Chinese Value-Added Tax (VAT)
of 13% of the gross sales price. On April 29, 2008, the PRC State of Administration of Taxation (SAT) released Notice #56,   Exemption
of VAT for Organic Fertilizer Products  , which allows certain fertilizer products to be exempt from VAT beginning June
1, 2008. The Company submitted the application for exemption in May 2009, which was granted effective September 1, 2009, continuing
through December 31, 2015.

Overview   

We
are engaged in research, development, production and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the PRC
through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiaries, Jinong and Gufeng (including Gufeng s subsidiary Tianjuyuan), and our VIE,
Yuxing. Our primary business is fertilizer products, specifically humic-acid based compound fertilizer produced by Jinong and
compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizer, highly-concentrated water-soluble
fertilizer and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer produced by Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce
various agricultural products, such as top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings. For financial reporting purposes,
our operations are organized into three business segments: fertilizer products (Jinong), fertilizer products (Gufeng) and agricultural
products production(Yuxing).  

The
fertilizer business conducted by Jinong and Gufeng generated approximately 97.8% and 97.7% of our total revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Yuxing serves as a research and development base for our fertilizer products.

Fertilizer
Products   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had developed and produced a total of 670 different fertilizer products in use, of which 134 were developed
and produced by Jinong, 332 by Gufeng, and 224 by the VIE Companies.  

Below
is a table that shows the metric tons of fertilizer sold by Jinong and Gufeng and the revenue per ton for the periods indicated:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold approximately 55,211 metric tons of fertilizer products, as compared to 55,686
metric tons for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Jinong sold approximately
9,680 metric tons of fertilizer products, as compared to 10,064 metric tons for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Gufeng sold approximately 45,531 metric tons of fertilizer products, as compared to
45,622 metric tons for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Our sales of fertilizer products to customers located
in five provinces within China accounted for approximately 53.3% of our fertilizer revenue for three months ended September 30,
2016. Specifically, the provinces and their respective percentage contributed to our fertilizer revenues were: Hebei (17.1%),
Heilongjiang (7.8%), Shaanxi (6.9%), Liaoning (5.9%) and Inner Mongolia (5.2%). 

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a total of 1,913 distributors covering 27 provinces, four autonomous regions and three central government-controlled
municipalities in China. Jinong had 1,084 distributors in China. Jinong s sales are not dependent on any single distributor
or any group of distributors. Jinong s top five distributors accounted for 1.7% of its fertilizer revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Gufeng had 301 distributors, including some large state-owned enterprises. Gufeng s top
five distributors accounted for 65.8% of its revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Agricultural
Products   

Through Yuxing, we develop, produce and sell high-quality
flowers, green vegetables and fruits to local marketplaces and various horticulture and planting companies. We also use certain
of Yuxing s greenhouse facilities to conduct research and development activities for our fertilizer products. The three
PRC provinces and municipal that accounted for 87.4% of our agricultural products revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were Shaanxi (81.6%), Shanghai (3.0%), and Gansu (2.8%). 

Recent
Developments   

New
Products   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Jinong did not launch any new fertilizer product. However, Jinong added 8 new distributors
during this period. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Gufeng launched two new fertilizer products. Gufeng also
added one new distributors during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Strategic Acquisitions  

On June 30, 2016, through Jinong, we entered into (i)
Strategic Acquisition Agreements (the  SAA ), and (ii) Agreements for Convertible Notes (the  ACN ), with
the shareholders of the Acquisition VIE Companies.

Pursuant to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of
the Acquisition VIE Companies, while be in possession of the equity interests and will continue to be the legal owners of such
interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof but excluding any claims
or encumbrances, and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange of an aggregated amount of RMB37,000,000
(approximately $5,579,600) to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA, ACN and the VIE Agreements,
and convertible notes with an aggregated face value of RMB51,000,000 (approximately $7,690,800) with an annual fixed compound interest
rate of 3% and term of three years. 

Jinong acquired the Acquisition VIE Companies using
the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory requirements under the PRC
laws. 

As our business focuses on the production of fertilizer,
all of our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry in China. Specifically, we deal with compliance,
regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farm land use and transfer, growing and distribution of
agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of grains. It is an industry in which heavy regulations
get implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, E-commerce, which is also under strict government regulations in the PRC, has
lately become a sale and distribution channel for agricultural products. Currently, we are developing an online platform to connect
the physical distribution network we either own or lease. 

Compared with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions,
the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, the  M A Rules  purports to require that an offshore
special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals and formed for purposes of overseas listing
through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (the  CSRC ) prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle s securities
on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval
of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. However, the CSRC has not issued any definitive rules or interpretations concerning
whether offerings such as the Offering are subject to the CSRC approval procedures under the M A Rules. Based on our understanding
of the PRC Laws (including the M A Rules), a prior approval from the CSRC is not required for the Offering because (1) the
Company established its first foreign invested enterprise in 1999, prior to the adoption of M A Rules; (2) the Company did
not acquire any equity interests or assets of a PRC company owned by its controlling shareholders or beneficial owners who are
PRC companies or individuals, as such terms are defined under the M A Rules. However, uncertainties still exist as to how the
M A Rule will be interpreted and implemented and our opinion stated above is subject to any new laws, rules and regulations
or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M A Rule. 

For both E-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC
regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set particularly rules for foreign-owned entities to conduct business.
We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in E-commerce and agriculture industries. VIE arrangement,
however, provides feasibility for the purpose of obtaining administrative approval process and avoiding industry restrictions that
be imposed on an entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign entity. The VIE agreements reduces uncertainty and the current
limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well as the control we obtained through VIE arrangement, are
valid and enforceable. Such legal structure does not violate the known, published, and current PRC laws. While there are substantial
uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no
assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding
stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign
ownership ca be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement. Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity
pledge agreements provide legal protection for the control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed
the equity pledge processes with the Acquisition VIE Companies to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Acquisition
VIE Companies. The shareholders of the Acquisition VIE Companies are not entitled to transfer any shares to the third party under
the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to our company without consideration. 

While the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility
to conduct our business in the E-Commerce and agriculture industries, validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject
to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors 
rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting creditors  rights, (iii) certain
equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and enforceability of contractual rights generally under concepts
of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and applicable statutes
of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution or implementation of any legal documents that would
be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercionary at the conclusions thereof; and (v) judicial discretion
with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorney s
fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process. Validity and enforceability
of VIE arrangement is also subject to risk derived from the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial
bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there can no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed,
amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retrospective effect. 

Results
of Operations   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2015.    

Net
Sales   

Total
net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $61,884,622, an increase of $7,700,351 or 14.2%, from $54,184,271
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to the inclusion of VIEs  net sales during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, which contributed approximately $13.3 million, or 21.5%, of the total net sales. The
total net sales without including VIEs  net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $48,592,645, a decrease
of $5,591,626, or 10.3%, from the same period a year ago.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Jinong s net sales decreased $3,280,084, or 9.5%, to $31,427,720 from $34,707,804
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in Jinong s sales volume,
which was result of Jinong s implementation of its new sales strategy that further focuses on producing high-margin liquid
fertilizer during the last three months.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Gufeng s net sales were $15,809,514, a decrease of $2,425,318, or 13.3% from
$18,234,832 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was mainly attributable to Gufeng s lowering selling
prices to answer to market demand during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Yuxing s net sales were $1,355,411, an increase of $113,776 or 9.2%, from
$1,241,635 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in market demand
and the higher prices on Yuxing s top grade flowers during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Cost
of Goods Sold   

Total
cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $38,453,594, an increase of $8,457,485, or 28.2%, from $29,996,109
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly due to the production and sale of VIEs  products,
which accounted for $10,753,679, or 28.0% of total cost of goods sold. The total cost of goods sold without including VIEs 
cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $27,699,915, a decrease of $2,296,194, or 7.7%, from the
same period a year ago.   

Cost of goods sold by Jinong for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $13,269,230, a decrease of $1,271,155, or 8.7%, from $14,540,385 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of goods was primarily attributable to the 9.5% decrease in net sale during the
last three months. 

Cost
of goods sold by Gufeng for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $13,385,077, a decrease of $1,360,597, or 9.2%, from
$14,745,674 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the less products sold
during the last three months.  

For
three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of goods sold by Yuxing was $1,045,608, an increase of $335,558, or 47.3%, from $710,050
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was mainly due to the increase in Yuxing s net sales and the
labor costs.   

Gross
Profit   

Total
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $757,134, or 3.1%, to $23,431,028, as compared to $24,188,162
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin was 37.9% and 44.6% for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the recent acquisition of VIEs, which mainly
sells low-margin fertilizer products. The gross profit without including VIE s gross profit was $20,892,730 with a gross
profit margin of 43.0%.  

Gross
profit generated by Jinong decreased by $2,008,929, or 10.0%, to $18,158,490 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$20,167,419 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin from Jinong s sales was approximately 57.8%
and 58.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly
due to higher raw material cost and higher packaging cost.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit generated by Gufeng was $2,424,437, a decrease of $1,064,721, or 30.5%,
from $3,489,158 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit margin from Gufeng s sales was approximately
15.3% and 19.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage
was mainly due to the further increased weight for sales of lower-margin products in Gufeng s total sales answering to market
demand.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit generated by Yuxing was $309,803, a decrease of $221,782, or 41.7% from
$531,585 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gross profit margin was approximately 22.9% and 42.8% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the higher
labor cost during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit generated by VIEs were $2,538,298 with a gross profit margin of approximately 19.1% for the three months ended September
30, 2016.  

Selling
Expenses   

Our selling expenses consisted primarily of salaries
of sales personnel, advertising and promotion expenses, freight-out costs and related compensation. Selling expenses were $5,012,068,
or 8.1%, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,343,755 or 4.3% of net sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2,668,313, or 113.8%. This increase was primarily due to Jinong, and the inclusion
of VIEs  selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The selling expenses of VIEs were $353,908, or 2.7%,
of VIEs  net sales. The selling expenses of Yuxing were $7,711 or 0.6% of Yuxing s net sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7,705, or 0.6% of Yuxing s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The selling expenses of Gufeng were $145,328 or 0.9% of Gufeng s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $152,685, or 0.8% of Gufeng s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The selling expenses
of Jinong for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,505,121 or 14.2% of Jinong s net sales, as compared to selling
expenses of $2,183,365, or 6.3% of Jinong s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Jinong s
selling expenses was due to Jinong s expanded marketing efforts and the increase in shipping costs. 

Selling
Expenses   amortization of deferred assets   

Our
selling expenses - amortization of our deferred assets were $6,108,782, or 9.8%, of net sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to $9,712,715 or 17.9% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $3,603,933,
or 37.1%. This decrease was due to the fact that some of the deferred assets were fully amortized and therefore no amortization
was recorded on the fully amortized assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses consisted primarily of related salaries, rental expenses, business development, depreciation and travel
expenses incurred by our general and administrative departments and legal and professional expenses including expenses incurred
and accrued for certain litigations. General and administrative expenses were $3,231,487, or 5.2% of net sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,753,642, or 5.1%, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $477,845, or 17.4%.  The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to VIEs, which had $525,973 general
and administrative expenses during the last three months.  

   Total
Other Expenses   

Total other expenses consisted of income from subsidies received from the PRC government, interest income,
interest expenses and bank charges. Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1 02,980,
as compared to $354,936 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in expense of $251,956, or 71.0%. The decrease
in total other expense was partly resulted from interest expense decreased by $290,490 or 67.7%, to $138,545 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $429,035 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was due to the less amount
of short-term loans.   

Income
Taxes   

Jinong
is subject to a preferred tax rate of 15% as a result of its business being classified as a High-Tech project under the PRC Enterprise
Income Tax Law ( EIT ) that became effective on January 1, 2008. Jinong incurred income tax expenses of $987,512
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,220,708 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of $233,196, or 19.1%. The decrease was due to the decrease in Jinong s net income.  

Gufeng
is subject to a tax rate of 25%, incurred income tax expenses of $307,735 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $556,734 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $248,999, or 44.7%, which was primarily due to Gufeng s
decreased net income.  

Yuxing
has no income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a result of being exempted from paying income tax
due to its products fall into the tax exemption list set out in the EIT.  

Net
Income   

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7, 351,580,
an increase of $105,908, or 1.5%, compared to $7,245,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income as a percentage
of total net sales was approximately 11.9% and 13.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Discussion
of Segment Profitability Measures   

As
of September 30, 2016, we were engaged in the following businesses: the production and sale of fertilizers through Jinong and
Gufeng and the production and sale of high-quality agricultural products by Yuxing. For financial reporting purpose, our operations
were organized into three main business segments based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer
production) and Yuxing (agricultural products production). Each of the segments has its own annual budget with regard to development,
production and sales.   

Each
of the three operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker
( CODM ) makes decisions with respect to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial
information, including revenue, gross margin, operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems;
however, net income by segment is the principal benchmark to measure profit or loss adopted by the CODM.  

For Jinong, the net income decreased by $1,4 66,563,
or 21.5% to $5,346,288 for three months ended September 30, 2016, from $6,812,851 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease was principally due to decreased net sales and higher selling expenses.  

For
Gufeng, the net income decreased by $903,881 or 55.8% to $716,486 for three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,620,367 for
three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally due to the decrease in net sales and higher general and administrative
expense. .  

For
Yuxing, the net income decreased 249,205 or 61.3% to $157,080 for three months ended September 30, 2016 from $406,285 for three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the higher cost of goods sold.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations, borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings
of our securities consummated in July 2009 and November/December 2009 (collectively the  Public Offerings ).  

As
of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $108,121,059, an increase of $5,224,573, or 5.1%, from $102,896,486 as of
June 30, 2016.  

We
intend to use some of the remaining net proceeds from the Public Offerings, as well as other working capital if required, to acquire
new businesses, upgrade production lines and complete Yuxing s new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products located
on 88 acres of land in Hu County, 18 kilometers southeast of Xi an city. Yuxing purchased a set of agricultural products
testing equipment for the year of 2016. We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow from
operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions
or expansions. However, if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required
to seek additional capital and/or to reduce certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to achieve our business objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek additional financing as necessary
for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous, which may include additional debt and/or equity
financings. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any equity
financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants.  

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:  

Operating
Activities   

Net cash provided in operating activities
was $ 5,146,213 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,909,900, or 27.1% from cash provided by operating activities of $7,056,113 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to increase in account receivable and inventories offset
by the decrease in advance to suppliers and customer deposits during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015.  

Investing
Activities   

Net cash used in investing activities for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $71,470, compared to cash used in investing activities of $2,590 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The different was due to Company purchased more plant, property and equipments during the last three months
compared to the same period last year. 

Financing
Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $300,000, compared to $1,915,200 net cash used in financing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, which was largely due to we had $1,499,940 of repayment of loans for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $5,107,200 in the same period last year. 

As
of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, our loans payable were as follows:  

Accounts
Receivable   

We
had accounts receivable of $116,563,778 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $117,055,376 as of June 30, 2016, a decrease
of $491,598 or 0.4%. This decrease was insignificant.  

Allowance
for doubtful accounts in account receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,006,879 from $308,310 as of June
30, 2016. And the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was 2.5% as of September 30, 2016 and
0.46% as of June 30, 2016.  

Deferred
assets   

We
had deferred assets of $7,274,334 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $13,431,621 as of June 30, 2016. We assisted the
distributors in certain marketing efforts and developing standard stores to expand our competitive advantage and market shares
since December 31, 2013. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts
and store development will be expensed over three years as long as the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor
defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount
owed by the distributor is payable to us immediately. The Company s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Li, provided credit backup
guarantee toward potential losses to the Company of any amounts due from distributors in this matter.  

Inventories   

We
had inventories of $79,059,776 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $87,436,315 as of June 30, 2016, a decrease of $8,376,539,
or 9.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to Gufeng s inventory. As of June 30, 2016, Gufeng s inventory
was $51,647,180 as of September 30, 2016, compared to $60,183,741 as of June 30, 2016.   

Advances
to Suppliers   

We
had advances to suppliers of $31,252,930 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $26,863,959 as of June 30, 2016, representing
an increase of $4,388,971 or 16.3% due to the large acquisition of raw material this quarter. To ensure our ability to deliver
compound fertilizer to the distributor timely prior to the planting season, we need to have sufficient raw material in stock to
stabilize the production. To build up the inventory, we typically make advance payment to the suppliers to secure the supply of
raw material of basic fertilizer. Our inventory level may fluctuate from time to time, depending how fast the raw material gets
consumed and replenished during the production process, and how fast the finished goods get sold. The replenishment of raw material
relies on the management s estimate of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the raw material s future
price, and spot price along with their volatility, as well as the seasonal demand and future price of finished fertilizer
products. Such estimate may not be accurate, and the purchase decision of raw materials based on the estimate can cause excessive
inventories in slow sales and insufficient inventories in peak times.  

Accounts
Payable   

We
had accounts payable of $5,927,974 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $5,246,153 as of June 30, 2016, representing an increase
of $681,821, or 13.0%. The increase was primarily due to the the VIEs, which had $4,442,190 accounts payable as of September 30,
2016.  

Customer
Deposits   

We
had customer deposits of $4,420,357 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to $8,578,341 as of June 30, 2016, representing a decrease
of $4,157,984, or 48.5%. The decrease was mainly attributable to Gufeng s $1,435,351 unearned revenue as of September
30, 2016, compared to $4,381,169 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2016, caused by the advancement deposits made by client. This
decrease was seasonal fluctuation and we expect to deliver products to our customers during the next three months at which time
we will recognize the revenue.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Management s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect
the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. See
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements,  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
We believe that the following paragraphs reflect the most critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition
and results of operations:  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the
estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  

Revenue
recognition   

Sales
revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable,
the delivery is completed, we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received
before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.  

Our
revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance is
made as products delivered and accepted by customers are normally not returnable and sales discounts are normally not granted
after products are delivered.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

For
statement of cash flows purposes, we consider all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.  

Accounts
receivable   

Our
policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts
receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Any accounts receivable of Jinong and Gufeng
that is outstanding for more than 180 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts, and any accounts receivable of Yuxing
that is outstanding for more than 90 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts.  

Deferred
assets   

Deferred
assets represent amounts the Company advanced to the distributors in their marketing and stores development to expand our competitive
advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing
efforts and store development will be expensed over three years as long as the distributors are actively selling our products.
If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the realization the contractual terms, the
unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor has to be refunded to us immediately. The Company s Chairman
and CEO, Mr. Li, provided credit backup guarantee toward potential losses to the Company of any amounts due from distributors
in this matter.   

Segment
reporting   

FASB
ASC 280 requires use of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based
on the way a company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner
in which management disaggregates a company.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we were organized into three main business segments: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer
production) and Yuxing (agricultural products production) and the VIE Companies.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Disclosures
About Market Risk    

We
may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the
risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices. We currently do not, in the normal course
of business, use financial instruments that are subject to changes in financial market conditions.  

Currency
Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk    

Substantially
all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in RMB. However, we use U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. Conversion
of RMB into foreign currencies is regulated by the People s Bank of China through a unified floating exchange rate system.
Although the PRC government has stated its intention to support the value of RMB, there can be no assurance that such exchange
rate will not again become volatile or that RMB will not devalue significantly against U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations
may adversely affect the value, in U.S. dollar terms, of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the PRC.  

Our
reporting currency is U.S. dollar. Except for U.S. holding companies, all of our consolidated revenues, consolidated costs and
expenses, and our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results
of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against U.S.
dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates, revenues and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates, and shareholders  equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation
adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component
of shareholders  equity. As of September 30, 2016, our accumulated other comprehensive income was $35.4 million. We have
not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. The value of the Renminbi
against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China s political and economic
conditions. Between July 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016, China s currency dropped by a cumulative 6.7% against the U.S.
dollar on hopes of boosting the domestic economy, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that
amount. The effect on trade can be substantial. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, the PRC authorities may lift restrictions
on fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.   

Interest
Rate Risk     

We
deposit surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. All
of our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interests. The amount of short-term debt outstanding as of September
30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was $4.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with
respect to our short-term bank loans. Although the interest rates, which are based on the banks  prime rates with respect
to our short-term loans, are fixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically three to twelve months for short-term bank
loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal. There were no material changes in interest rates for short-term bank
loans renewed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The original loan term on average is one year, and the remaining
average life of the short term-loans is approximately five months.  

Management
monitors the banks  prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances
relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest
rate risk.  

Credit
Risk    

We
have not experienced significant credit risk, as most of our customers are long-term customers with superior payment records.
Our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers.  

Inflation
Risk    

Inflationary
factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high
rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with
these increased costs.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures    

At
the conclusion of the period ended September 30, 2016 we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ),
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)

and CFO concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective and adequately designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules
and forms, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, in a manner
that allowed for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
 Changes in internal controls    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
