Note 1.  Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  EuroSite Power Inc., (the "Company", we, our, or us), distributes, owns and operates clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water and heat and cooling in the United Kingdom. We provide comprehensive power purchase style thermal and power generation solutions to our customers. These solutions include equipment installation as well as operation and ongoing maintenance under multi-year service agreements at no upfront cost to the customer. We own and operate the equipment that we install at customers' facilities and sell the energy produced by these systems to the customers on a long-term contractual basis at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates. We call this business the EuroSite Power  On-Site Utility  model. 
    
  The Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on   July 9, 2010   as a subsidiary of American DG Energy Inc., or American DG Energy. On September 17, 2010, the Company registered EuroSite Power Limited as a wholly-owned subsidiary with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales to introduce the American DG Energy business model to the United Kingdom and the European market, although as of   September 30, 2016  , we operated in the United Kingdom only. 
    
  The Company has experienced total net losses since inception of approximately   $10.2 million  . For the foreseeable future, the Company expects to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as its management executes its current business plan. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, its ability to control certain costs, including those related to general and administrative expenses, the project financing arrangements and the line of credit available from its CEO will be sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future; however, as the Company continues to grow its business by adding more energy systems, the cash requirements will increase.  
    
  The Company is engaged in continual fundraising efforts, primarily for the installation of energy systems.   On May 12, 2016, the Company completed a private placement with related parties of   12,608,696   shares of its common stock for aggregate proceeds of   $7.25 million   at   $0.575   per share.   The shares sold in this placement are subject to a registration rights agreement where the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to register the shares issued at the request of the holder.   The Company used a portion of these proceeds to pay off its debt to its former Chairman, of   $2,000,000  , with the balance being retained to fund operations and growth.  
    
  On June 28, 2016,   $2.1 million   of the Company s   $2.4 million   of related party convertible debentures were converted into   3,909,260   shares of common stock of the Company at a price of   $0.54   per share. Additionally,   $11,000   of accrued interest was also converted at the same price. As the price used to convert the convertible debentures was less than the then contractual conversion price of   $0.60   per share of common stock, the fair value of the incremental shares issued to the holders of the convertible debentures over and above the contractually required amount of   $224,782   was expensed as debt conversion expense. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , American DG Energy owned a   2.03%   interest in the Company and accounts for this ownership at fair value in its financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), as of that date. Immediately prior to this date, American DG Energy accounted for its 20.5% investment in the Company on the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Prior to June 28, 2016 American DG accounted for its 48.04% investment in the Company as a consolidated subsidiary as it determined it was the primary beneficiary of EuroSite under the variable interest model. That determination included consideration of an implicit variable interest held by American DG Energy in the form of a guarantee of the long-term convertible indebtedness of EuroSite Power. On June 28, 2016, substantially all of that convertible indebtedness was converted by the holders into shares of EuroSite Power (see Note 5 Convertible debentures), rendering the American DG s guarantee inconsequential in the determination. As a result, American DG Energy concluded it no longer held a variable interest in EuroSite Power. American DG deconsolidated EuroSite Power in its consolidated financial statements and accounted for the investment on the equity method in its financial statements in accordance with GAAP, as of that date.  

Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article  
  
   7 

EUROSITE POWER INC. 

8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  
    
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or the Annual Report. 
    
  There have been no significant changes in accounting principles, practices or inherent estimates from those reported in the Annual Report.  
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, EuroSite Power Limited, a United Kingdom registered company.  
    
  The Company s operations are comprised of   one   business segment. The Company s business is to sell energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water, cooling, and natural gas to its customers under long-term sales agreements.  

Note 2.  Loss Per Common Share 
    
  The Company computes basic loss per share by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. The Company computes its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury stock method. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the Company considers its shares issuable in connection with stock options, warrants and debentures to be dilutive Common Stock equivalents when the exercise price is less than the average fair market value of the Company s Common Stock for the period. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company excluded   11,022,790   potentially dilutive shares resulting from stock options, warrants and convertible debentures. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company excluded   11,165,000   potentially dilutive shares resulting from stock options, warrants and convertible debentures. All shares issuable for both periods were anti-dilutive as a result of the reported net loss. 

Note 3.  Income Taxes 
    
     The benefit for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   differs from that which would be expected by applying the federal and foreign statutory tax rate primarily due to losses for which no benefit is recognized. 

Note 4.  Related Parties 
    
  American DG Energy and Tecogen Inc. are affiliated companies by virtue of common ownership and common leadership.  
    
  The Company purchases some of its energy equipment from American DG Energy. American DG Energy purchases energy equipment primarily from Tecogen, an affiliate of the Company, which manufactures natural gas, engine-driven commercial and industrial cooling and cogeneration systems and ultra-high efficiency heating products, such as a high efficiency water heater, for commercial and industrial applications utilizing advanced thermodynamic principles. 
    
  Elias Samaras is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the board of directors. He is also a member of the board of directors of American DG Energy. His Company salary is   $1.00   per year, exclusive of option awards. On average, Dr. Samaras spends approximately   60%   of his business time on the affairs of the Company, but such amount varies widely depending on the needs of the business and is expected to increase as the business of the Company develops. 
    
  John N. Hatsopoulos was the chairman of the Company's board of directors, resigning on May 16, 2016, and is also the Co-Chief Executive Officer of American DG Energy and Tecogen. He is also a member of the board of directors of American DG Energy and Tecogen. His Company salary was   $1.00   per year. On average, Mr. Hatsopoulos spent  
  
   8 

EUROSITE POWER INC. 

approximately   20%   of his business time on the affairs of the Company, but such amount varied widely depending on the needs of the business and is expected to increase as the business of the Company develops. 
    
  Bonnie J. Brown is the Chief Financial Officer, treasurer and secretary of the Company and American DG Energy. Her salary is paid by American DG Energy; however a portion was reimbursed by the Company according to the requirements of the business. On average, Ms. Brown spends approximately   25%   of her business time on the affairs of the Company, but such amount varies widely depending on the needs of the business. 
    
  Gabriel J. Parmese, was the Chief Financial Officer, treasurer and secretary of the Company and American DG Energy until August 12, 2015. His salary was paid by American DG Energy; however a portion was reimbursed by the Company according to the requirements of the business. On average, Mr. Parmese spent approximately   15%   of his business time on the affairs of the Company, but such amount varied widely depending on the needs of the business. 
    
  During the first quarter of   2015  , the Company prepaid   $1,000,000   of a related party note according to the terms of the agreement, leaving an outstanding balance of   $2,000,000  . During the second quarter of 2016, the outstanding balance of   $2,000,000   was repaid and this related party note was cancelled. 
    
  On July 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Revolving Line of Credit Agreement, (or the "Agreement"), with Elias Samaras, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the board of directors. Under the terms of the Agreement, Dr. Samaras has agreed to lend the Company up to an aggregate of   $1 million  , at the written request of the Company. Any amounts borrowed by the Company pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest at   6%   per year. Interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears. The term of the Agreement is from July 7, 2015 to June 30, 2017. Repayment of the principal amount borrowed pursuant to the Agreement will be due on June 30, 2017. Prepayment of any amounts due under the Agreement may be made at any time without penalty. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amounts have been drawn on this line. 
    
  On June 28, 2016,   $2.1 million   of the Company s   $2.4 million   of related party convertible debentures were converted into   3,909,260   shares of common stock of the Company at a price of   $0.54   per share. Additionally,   $11,000   of accrued interest was also converted at the same price. As the price used to convert the convertible debentures was less than the then contractual conversion price of   $0.60   per share of common stock, the fair value of the incremental shares issued to the holders of the convertible debentures over and above the contractually required amount of   $224,782   was expensed as debt conversion expense. 
    
  The Company s operations are headquartered in Macclesfield England and consists of leased office space. The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Waltham, Massachusetts and consist of   3,282   square feet of office and storage space used by our former parent, American DG Energy and leased from Tecogen. American DG Energy is not currently charging the Company for utilizing its share of office space in the United States since it believes it is insignificant. The amounts due to American DG Energy and Tecogen as of   September 30, 2016   was   $22,029   and   $35,959  , respectively.  

Note 5. Note payable - Bank

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Forward-looking statements are made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   seeks,   estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our current and future cash requirements, our expectations regarding suppliers of cogeneration units, and statements regarding potential financing activities in the future. While the Company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the Company s estimates change.  Readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the Company s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or the Quarterly Report. There are a number of important factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report and those included in the Company's Annual Report. 
    
  Overview 
    
  The Company distributes, owns and operates clean, on-site energy systems that produce electricity, hot water, heat and cooling in the United Kingdom. The Company derives sales from selling energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water, cooling, and natural gas to its customers under long-term energy sales agreements (with a typical term of 10 to 15 years). The energy systems are owned by the Company and are installed in our customers' buildings. Each month we obtain readings from our energy meters to determine the amount of energy produced for each customer. We multiply these readings by the appropriate published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from our customers' local energy utility, to derive the value of our monthly energy sale, less the applicable negotiated discount. Our revenues per customer on a monthly basis may vary based on the amount of energy produced by our energy systems and the published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from our customers' local energy utility that month. The Company adds revenue streams as new energy systems are deployed and become operational. 
    
  The profitability of our business model is highly dependent on the functionality of our energy equipment, the price of electricity, the demand for electricity, and to a lesser extent, the price of natural gas. Increase in demand for electricity tends to cause prices to rise. Higher electricity prices increase the Company s revenue and liquidity. Lower natural gas prices decrease operational cost. The Company does not have a primary source of natural gas or a principal supplier. The Company buys its natural gas from its customers and its customers' contracts with various local suppliers of natural gas. The Company does not hedge or lock in local natural gas prices, therefore, it is exposed to some natural gas cost risk. In addition, an uncertainty in the Company s business model exists where the pricing model of electricity and natural gas in Europe differs from the pricing model in the United States. To mitigate the risk of low electrical rates, the Company pursues energy system projects in areas with higher electrical rates. 
    
  The Company is engaged in continual fundraising efforts. The primary purpose of these efforts is to raise capital for the installation of energy systems. Generally, fundraising causes liquidity to increase. When the Company spends these funds to add new energy systems, its liquidity decreases and its capital expenditures increase. Generally, when the Company s new energy systems begin producing energy, the Company s revenue increases. 
    
  There is an ongoing consideration of how to access and lower the cost of capital. The Company regularly assesses the cost and availability of debt capital, preferred stock, convertible debentures, private equity financing, and public common stock offerings. The effect these fundraising efforts have on the business will depend on the type of fundraising. Generally, debt and convertible debenture financing will increase interest expense. Generally, convertible debentures, private equity, and public equity have the potential to dilute shareholder s earnings per share. To date, the Company has largely financed its growth through the private placements of convertible debt and equity. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company signed two project financing agreements which will provide funding for projects going forward.  
    
    On May 12, 2016, the Company completed a private placement with related parties of   12,608,696   shares of its common stock for aggregate proceeds of   $7.25 million   at   $0.575   per share.  The shares sold in this placement are subject to a registration rights agreement where the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to register the shares issued at the request of the holder. The Company used a portion of the proceeds to pay off its debt to its former Chairman of $2,000,000, with the balance being retained to fund operations and growth.

EUROSITE POWER INC. 

On June 28, 2016, $2.1 million of the Company s $2.4 million of convertible debentures were converted into   3,909,260 shares of   common stock of the Company at a price of $0.54 per share. Additionally, $11,000 of accrued interest was also converted at the same price. As the price used to convert the convertible debentures was less than the then contractual conversion price of $0.60 per share of common stock, the fair value of the incremental shares issued to the holders of the convertible debentures over and above the contractually required amount was expensed as debt conversion expense. 

Third Quarter 2016   Compared to the   Third Quarter 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenues in the   third quarter of 2016   were   $459,114   compared to   $421,991   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $37,123   or   8.8%  . The revenues increased primarily due to new sites and more sites being fully operational for a longer period of time in the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   32   systems operational compared to   28   systems as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Cost of sales, including depreciation expense, in the   third quarter of 2016   was   $420,272   compared to   $467,582   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease of   47,310   or   10.1%   is primarily attributable to lower maintenance and fuel costs.  
    
   Gross Profit  
    
    Gross profit in the   third quarter of 2016   was   $38,842  , compared to   $(45,591)   for the same period in   2015  . Gross margin in the   third quarter of 2016   was   8.5%   compared to   (10.8)%   for the   third quarter of 2015  . The principal reason for the increase in profitability was the decrease in maintenance costs as well as lower fuel prices. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  General and administrative expenses were   $379,286   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $194,053   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $185,233   or   95.5%  . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense as well as the unfavorable currency exchange rate.  
    
  Selling expenses were   $127,917   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $122,826   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $5,091   or   4.1%  . The increase was primarily due to the addition of a new salesperson. 
    
  Engineering expenses were   $110,593   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $87,853   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in expense of   $22,740  , or   25.9%  , was due to higher payroll for new engineering staff and supplies expenses as a result of bringing service in house. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Interest income was   $6,167   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $965   for the same period in   2015  , which represents interest on our cash balance. The increase in interest income is due to the higher cash balance for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . Interest and other expense was   $10,039   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to expense of   $8,599   for the same period in   2015  . The principal reason for higher expense in the   third quarter of 2016   was due to exchange rate charges resulting from funds transferred from the US. 
    
  Net Loss 
    
  Net loss was   $582,826   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $457,957   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   27.3%   from the prior year. This larger net loss is substantially due to the additional stock compensation expense, unfavorable currency fluctuations and increased engineering expenses.

EUROSITE POWER INC. 

First Nine Months of 2016   Compared to the   First Nine Months of 2015    
    
  Revenues 
    
  Revenues in the   first nine months of 2016   were   $1,786,583   compared to   $1,513,018   for the same period in   2015  . This was an increase of   $273,565   or   18.1%  . The revenues during the period increased due to the installation, start and expansion of energy generation at several sites. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   32   sites operational compared to   28   sites as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Cost of sales including depreciation expense and expense for fuel, maintenance, and installation, in the   first nine months of 2016   was   $1,501,756   compared to   $1,481,897   for the same period in   2015  . This increase of   $19,859   or   1.3%  , is due to higher depreciation expense associated with more operating sites. 
    
   Gross Profit 
    
    Gross profit, in the   first nine months of 2016  , was   $284,827  , compared to   $31,121   for the same period in   2015  . Gross margin improved to   15.9%   as compared to   2.1%   for the same period in   2015  , an improvement of   13.8%  . The principal reason for the improvement in profitability was the decrease in maintenance costs as well as lower gas prices. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  General and administrative expenses were   $1,011,546   in the   first nine months of 2016  , compared to   $627,798   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $383,748   or   61.1%  . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock compensation, legal and public relations expenses, as well as the unfavorable currency exchange rate.  
    
  Selling expenses were   $421,251   in the   first nine months of 2016  , compared to   $359,298   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $61,953   or   17.2%  .  The increase was primarily due to the addition of a new salesperson as well as increased advertising and bad debt expenses. 
    
  Engineering expenses were   $289,089   in the   first nine months of 2016  , compared to   $162,008   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in expense of   $127,081   or   78.4%   is due to higher payroll, as well as transportation and supplies expenses as a result of bringing service in house. 
     
  Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Other income (expense), net was an expense of   $245,517   for the   first nine months of 2016  , compared to an expense of   $27,348   for the same period in   2015  , an increase in expense of   $218,169  . The principal reason for higher expense in 2016 was the debt conversion expense of   $224,782   incurred in connection with the second quarter 2016 conversion of debt to common stock of the Company on terms more favorable than the original contract. 
    
  Net Loss 
    
  Net loss was   $1,682,576   in the   first nine months of 2016  , compared to net loss of   $1,143,143   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in the net loss is primarily due to the debt conversion expense, additional stock compensation expense, currency fluctuations and increased selling expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Consolidated working capital was   $4,554,074   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $750,948   at   December 31, 2015  . Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of   $4,597,780   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $587,819   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in working capital was primarily a result of the   $7.25 million   private placement of our common stock during the second quarter of 2016, offset by a payoff of related party debt of   $2 million  , as well as costs of operations and purchases of property and equipment related to our sites. 
    
   Cash used in operating activities was   $762,662   in the   first nine months of 2016  .  Cash was provided by operating activities due to the receipt of the UK tax energy incentives of   $369,485  , offset by a net loss of   $1,682,576  . 
  
   12 

EUROSITE POWER INC. 

The primary investing activities of the Company s operations included the purchase of equipment. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company used   $823,132   for purchases of equipment. 

The Company owns the energy-producing equipment at the customer s site; therefore, the business is capital intensive. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, its ability to control certain costs, including those related to general and administrative expenses, the project financing arrangements and the line of credit available from its CEO will be sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing business for the foreseeable future; however, as the Company continues to grow its business by adding more energy systems, the cash requirements will increase. The Company may need to raise additional capital.  
    
  Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. If these conditions continue and we cannot increase our authorized shares and raise funds through a public or private debt financing, or an equity offering, our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected. In any such event, the Company may need to suspend any new installation of energy systems and significantly reduce its operating costs until market conditions or our access to capital improve. 

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates 
    
  The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in  Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to its Consolidated Financial Statements which are incorporated in the Company's Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The accounting policies and estimates that can have a significant impact upon the operating results, financial position and footnote disclosures of the Company are described in  Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements described above. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, including any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. 

Emerging Growth Company 
    
  We are and we will remain an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
    
  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to  opt out  of any extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under  Risk Factors  in our most recent Annual Report. The risks discussed in our Annual Report could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
  The United Kingdom s impending departure from the European Union and the resultant exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainties could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the  U.K. ) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the  E.U. ), commonly referred to as  Brexit . The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. We translate revenue denominated in British pounds into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported revenue may be reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars.  
  As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will negotiate the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from the E.U.  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from and future relationship with the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.  A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U. and create global economic uncertainty, which may cause customers in our target markets to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services.  Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business and operating results.
