NOTE 1: 
    Description of Business and Presentation of Financial Statements 
       
  References herein to HollyFrontier Corporation ( HollyFrontier ) include HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC )  Plain English  guidelines, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been written in the first person. In these financial statements, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  refer only to HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HollyFrontier or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person, with certain exceptions. Generally, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  include Holly Energy Partners, L.P. ( HEP ) and its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries of HollyFrontier, unless when used in disclosures of transactions or obligations between HEP and HollyFrontier or its other subsidiaries. These financial statements contain certain disclosures of agreements that are specific to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not necessarily represent obligations of HollyFrontier. When used in descriptions of agreements and transactions,  HEP  refers to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  We are principally an independent petroleum refiner that produces high-value light products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, specialty lubricant products, and specialty and modified asphalt. We own and operate petroleum refineries that serve markets throughout the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. As of   September 30, 2016  , we: 

owned and operated a petroleum refinery in El Dorado, Kansas (the  El Dorado Refinery ),   two   refinery facilities located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (collectively, the  Tulsa Refineries ), a refinery in Artesia, New Mexico that is operated in conjunction with crude oil distillation and vacuum distillation and other facilities situated   65   miles away in Lovington, New Mexico (collectively, the  Navajo Refinery ), a refinery located in Cheyenne, Wyoming (the  Cheyenne Refinery ) and a refinery in Woods Cross, Utah (the  Woods Cross Refinery  
                
    owned and operated HollyFrontier Asphalt Company LLC ( HFC Asphalt ) which operates various asphalt terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma; and 
                
    owned a   39%   interest in HEP, a consolidated variable interest entity ( VIE ), which includes our   2%   general partner interest. 
       
  On October 29, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, 9952110 Canada Inc. ( Purchaser ), entered into a share purchase agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. ( Suncor ) to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. ( PCLI ), for cash consideration of CAD $1.125 billion (or approximately $845 million based on the exchange rate at time of signing), subject to customary adjustments at closing. The PCLI plant, located in Mississauga, Ontario, is the largest producer of base oils in Canada with 15,600 BPD of lubricant production capacity, and is the only North American producer of high margin Group III base oils. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, PCLI and the Purchaser will enter into various commercial and lease agreements with Suncor. The share purchase agreement provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants, and provides for the payment of fees by the Purchaser to Suncor upon the termination of the share purchase agreement under certain circumstances, including failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. We expect to fund the transaction with a combination of debt and cash on hand. 
    
  We have prepared these consolidated financial statements without audit. In management s opinion, these consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and consolidated cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Although certain notes and other information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted, we believe that the disclosures in these consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   that has been filed with the SEC. 
    
  Our results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be realized for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .

  HOLLYFRONTIER CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) Continued 

Accounts Receivable:    Our accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers that are primarily companies in the petroleum industry. Credit is extended based on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition, and in certain circumstances collateral, such as letters of credit or guarantees, is required. We reserve for doubtful accounts based on our historical loss experience as well as specific accounts identified as high risk, which historically have been minimal. Credit losses are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed uncollectible. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was   $2.3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Inventories:    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method for crude oil, unfinished and finished refined products and the average cost method for materials and supplies, or market. In periods of rapidly declining prices, LIFO inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to LIFO layers in prior periods. In addition, the use of the LIFO inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO inventory costs generated in prior periods. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. 
    
  Goodwill and Long-lived Assets:   As of   December 31, 2015  , our goodwill balance was   $2.3 billion  , with   $1.7 billion  ,   $0.3 billion   and   $0.3 billion   allocated to our El Dorado Refinery, Cheyenne Refinery and HEP reporting units, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails a comparison of our reporting unit fair values relative to their respective carrying values. If carrying value exceeds fair value for a reporting unit, we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill based on estimates of the fair value of all assets and liabilities in the reporting unit. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, there had been no impairments to goodwill. 
    
  Our long-lived assets principally consist of our refining assets that are organized as refining asset groups. These refinery asset groups also constitute our individual refinery reporting units that are used for testing and measuring goodwill impairments (El Dorado and Cheyenne). Our long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and if so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss measured, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset group s carrying value exceeds its fair value. 
    
  Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments 
  As of   April 30, 2016  , we performed interim goodwill impairment and related long-lived asset impairment testing of our El Dorado and Cheyenne Refinery reporting units after identifying a combination of events and circumstances which were indicators of potential goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, including lower than typical gross margins during the summer driving season, a current outlook of lower future gross margins, and the recent decline in our common share price which has resulted in a decrease in our market capitalization. In conjunction with our interim goodwill impairment testing performed, we first assessed the carrying values of our refining long-lived asset groups for recoverability. 
  The estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and long-lived asset groups were derived using a combination of both income and market approaches. The income approach reflects expected future cash flows based on estimates of future crack spreads, forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our market approaches include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions of other like-kind assets. These fair value measurements involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). See Note 3 for further discussion of Level 3 inputs. 
  As a result of our impairment testing during the second quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Cheyenne Refinery had been impaired and recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of   $344.8 million  . Additionally, the carrying value of the Cheyenne Refinery s goodwill was fully impaired and a goodwill impairment charge of   $309.3 million   was also recorded, representing all of the goodwill allocated to our Cheyenne Refinery. Our interim testing did not identify any other impairment.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) Continued 

We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016 and determined the fair value of our El Dorado reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately   4%  . A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in gross margins could result in an impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets of the El Dorado reporting unit at some point in the future. Such impairment charges could be material. Additionally, testing indicated no impairment of goodwill attributable to our HEP reporting unit. 
    
  Income Taxes  : Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences in income for financial and tax purposes, using the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax expense of   $6.5 million   compared to   $446.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was due principally to a pre-tax loss during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to pre-tax earnings in the same period of   2015  . Our effective tax rates, before consideration of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were   2.5%   and   35.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate is due principally to the effects of the second quarter   $309.3 million   goodwill impairment charge, a significant cause of our   $255.0 million   loss before income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , that is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
    
  Inventory Repurchase Obligations:     We periodically enter into same-party sell / buy transactions, whereby we sell certain refined product inventory and subsequently repurchase the inventory in order to facilitate delivery to certain locations. Such sell / buy transactions are accounted for as inventory repurchase obligations under which proceeds received under the initial sell is recognized as an inventory repurchase obligation that is subsequently reversed when the inventory is repurchased. For the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  , we received proceeds of   $43.9 million   and   $66.0 million  , respectively, and repaid   $44.9 million   and   $67.2 million  , respectively, under these sell / buy transactions. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
  In March 2016, Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  was issued which simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2017, at which time we will adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  was issued requiring leases to be measured and recognized as a lease liability, with a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2019, and we are evaluating the impact of this standard. 
    
  Consolidation 
  In February 2015, ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation,  was issued to improve consolidation guidance for certain legal entities. It modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party provisions and provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for certain reporting entities that comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those included in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016, which did not affect our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  was issued requiring revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration for these goods or services. This standard has an effective date of January 1, 2018, and we are evaluating the impact of this standard.

NOTE 2: 
    Holly Energy Partners 
       
  HEP, a consolidated VIE, is a publicly held master limited partnership that owns and operates logistic assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that principally support our refining and marketing operations in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and Alon USA, Inc. s ( Alon ) refinery in Big Spring, Texas. Additionally, HEP owns a   75%   interest in UNEV Pipeline, LLC ( UNEV ), the owner of a pipeline running from Woods Cross, Utah to Las Vegas, Nevada (the  UNEV Pipeline ) and associated product terminals; a   50%   interest in Frontier Aspen LLC, the owner of a pipeline running from Wyoming to Frontier Station, Utah (the  Frontier Pipeline  a   50%   interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC, the owner of a pipeline running from Cushing, Oklahoma to El Dorado, Kansas (the  Osage Pipeline  a   50%   interest in Cheyenne Pipeline, LLC, the owner of a pipeline running from Fort Laramie, Wyoming to Cheyenne, Wyoming (the  Cheyenne Pipeline  and a   25%   interest in SLC Pipeline LLC, the owner of a pipeline (the  SLC Pipeline ) that serves refineries in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   39%   interest in HEP, including the   2%   general partner interest. As the general partner of HEP, we have the sole ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact HEP s financial performance, and therefore we consolidate HEP.  
    
  HEP has   two   primary customers (including us) and generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through its pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons, and storing and providing other services at its storage tanks and terminals. Under our long-term transportation agreements with HEP (discussed further below), we accounted for   83%   of HEP s total revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We do not provide financial or equity support through any liquidity arrangements and / or debt guarantees to HEP. 
    
  HEP has outstanding debt under a senior secured revolving credit agreement and its senior notes. HEP s creditors have no recourse to our assets. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 9 for a description of HEP s debt obligations. 
    
  HEP has risk associated with its operations. If a major customer of HEP were to terminate its contracts or fail to meet desired shipping or throughput levels for an extended period of time, revenue would be reduced and HEP could suffer substantial losses to the extent that a new customer is not found. In the event that HEP incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect HEP s loss, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in HEP at that point in time. 
    
  Woods Cross Assets 
  On October 3, 2016, HEP acquired from us all the membership interests of Woods Cross Operating LLC, which owns the crude unit, FCCU and polymerization unit of the first phase of our Woods Cross Refinery expansion project that was completed in the second quarter of 2016, for cash consideration of approximately   $278.0 million  . 
    
  In connection with this transaction, we entered into 15-year tolling agreements containing minimum quarterly throughput commitments that provide minimum annualized payments to HEP of   $56.7 million  . 
    
  Cheyenne Pipeline 
  On June 3, 2016, HEP acquired a   50%   interest in Cheyenne Pipeline LLC, owner of the Cheyenne Pipeline, in exchange for a contribution of   $42.5 million   in cash to Cheyenne Pipeline LLC. Cheyenne Pipeline will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ( Plains ), which owns the remaining 50% interest. The   87  -mile crude oil pipeline runs from Fort Laramie, Wyoming to Cheyenne, Wyoming and has an   80,000   BPD capacity. 
    
  Tulsa Tanks 
  On March 31, 2016, HEP acquired crude oil tanks located at our Tulsa Refineries from Plains for   $39.5 million  . Previously in 2009, we sold these tanks to Plains and leased them back, and due to our continuing interest in the tanks, we accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement. Accordingly, the tanks remained on our balance sheet and were depreciated for accounting purposes, and the proceeds received from Plains were recorded as a financing obligation and presented as a component of outstanding debt.  
    
  In accounting for HEP s March 2016 purchase from Plains, the amount paid was recorded against our outstanding financing obligation balance of   $30.8 million  , with the excess   $8.7 million   payment resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt.

Magellan Asset Exchange 
  On February 22, 2016, we acquired a   50%   membership interest in Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC ( Osage ) in exchange for a 20-year terminalling services agreement, whereby a subsidiary of Magellan Midstream Partners ( Magellan Midstream ) will provide terminalling services for all of our products originating in Artesia, New Mexico that require terminalling in or through El Paso, Texas. Under the agreement, we will be charged tariffs based on the volumes of refined product processed. Osage is the owner of the Osage Pipeline, a   135  -mile pipeline that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to our El Dorado Refinery in Kansas and also has a connection to the Jayhawk pipeline that services the CHS refinery in McPherson, Kansas. This exchange was accounted for at fair value, whereby the 50% membership interest in the Osage Pipeline was recorded at appraised fair value and an offsetting residual deferred credit in the amount of   $38.9 million   was recorded, which will be amortized over the 20-year service period. No gain or loss was recorded for this exchange. 
    
  Also on February 22, 2016, we contributed the   50%   membership interest in Osage to HEP, and in exchange received HEP s El Paso terminal. Pursuant to this exchange, HEP agreed to build two connections to Magellan Midstream s El Paso terminal. In addition, HEP agreed to become operator of the Osage Pipeline. This exchange was accounted for at carry-over basis with no resulting gain or loss. 
    
  Frontier Pipeline Transaction 
  On August 31, 2015, HEP purchased a   50%   interest in Frontier Aspen LLC (previously known as Frontier Pipeline Company), owner of the Frontier Pipeline, from an affiliate of Enbridge, Inc. for   $54.6 million  . Frontier Pipeline will continue to be operated by an affiliate of Plains, which owns the remaining 50% interest. The   289  -mile crude oil pipeline runs from Casper, Wyoming to Frontier Station, Utah, has a   72,000   BPD capacity, and supplies Canadian and Rocky Mountain crudes to Salt Lake City area refiners through a connection to the SLC Pipeline.  
    
  HEP s acquisitions from us are eliminated upon consolidation and have no impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  HEP Private Placement Agreement 
  On September 16, 2016, HEP entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement   3,420,000   HEP common units, representing limited partnership interests, at a price of   $30.18   per common unit. The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, at which time HEP received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Woods Cross assets acquisition. In connection with this private placement and to maintain our 2% general partner interest in HEP, we made capital contributions totaling   $2.1 million   to HEP in October 2016. After this common unit issuance, our interest in HEP is   37%  , including the   2%   general partner interest. Additionally, HEP entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers, which requires that HEP file a registration statement with the SEC within 60 days following the closing of the private placement to register the purchased units under the Securities Act. The registration statement will be automatically effective and the units fully transferable upon filing. 
    
  HEP Common Unit Continuous Offering Program 
  On May 10, 2016, HEP established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of   $200 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP has issued   703,455   units under this program, providing   $23.0 million   in net proceeds. In connection with this program and to maintain our   2%   general partner interest in HEP, we made capital contributions totaling   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  HEP intends to use the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Amounts repaid under HEP s credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time. 
    
  As a result of this transaction and resulting HEP ownership changes, we adjusted additional capital and equity attributable to HEP's noncontrolling interest holders to reallocate HEP's equity among its unitholders.

Transportation Agreements 
  HEP serves our refineries under long-term pipeline, terminal and tankage throughput agreements and refinery processing tolling agreements expiring from 2019 through 2036. Under these agreements, we pay HEP fees to transport, store and process throughput volumes of refined products, crude oil and feedstocks on HEP s pipeline, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and refinery processing units that result in minimum annual payments to HEP including UNEV (a consolidated subsidiary of HEP). Under these agreements, the agreed upon tariff rates are subject to annual tariff rate adjustments on July 1 at a rate based upon the percentage change in Producer Price Index or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission index. As of July 1, 2016, these agreements result in minimum annualized payments to HEP of   $321.1 million  . 

NOTE 3: 
    Fair Value Measurements 
       
  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and derivative instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. HEP s outstanding credit agreement borrowings and HFC s term loan also approximate fair value as interest rates are reset frequently at current interest rates on both debt instruments. 
    
  Fair value measurements are derived using inputs (assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk). GAAP categorizes inputs used in fair value measurements into three broad levels as follows: 

(Level 1) Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    (Level 2) Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    (Level 3) Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes valuation techniques that involve significant unobservable inputs. 
       
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of marketable securities, derivative instruments and senior notes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  
  HOLLYFRONTIER CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) Continued 

Level 1 Instruments 
  Our NYMEX futures contracts are exchange traded and are measured and recorded at fair value using quoted market prices, a Level 1 input.  
    
  Level 2 Instruments 
  Investments in marketable securities, derivative instruments consisting of commodity price swaps and forward sales and purchase contracts and HEP s interest rate swaps are measured and recorded at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The fair values of the commodity price and interest rate swap contracts are based on the net present value of expected future cash flows related to both variable and fixed rate legs of the respective swap agreements. The measurements are computed using market-based observable inputs, quoted forward commodity prices with respect to our commodity price swaps and the forward London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) yield curve with respect to HEP s interest rate swaps. The fair value of the marketable securities and senior notes is based on values provided by a third-party, which were derived using market quotes for similar type instruments, a Level 2 input.  
    
  Level 3 Instruments 
  We at times have forward commodity sales and purchase contracts for which quoted forward market prices are not readily available. The forward rate used to value these forward sales and purchase contracts are derived using a projected forward rate using quoted market rates for similar products, adjusted for regional pricing and grade differentials, a Level 3 input. 
    
  The following table presents the changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities (all related to derivative instruments) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  : 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges based on fair value measurements (see Note 1). Also, we recognized a non-recurring fair value measurement of   $44.4 million   that relates to HEP s equity interest in Osage in February 2016. The fair value measurements were based on a combination of valuation methods including discounted cash flows, and the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods, Level 3 inputs.

NOTE 4: 
    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Basic earnings per share is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders divided by the average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share assumes, when dilutive, the issuance of the net incremental shares from restricted shares and performance share units. The following is a reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders: 

NOTE 5: 
    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   two   principal share-based compensation plans (collectively, the  Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan ).  
    
  The compensation cost charged against income for these plans was   $6.2 million   and   $6.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $14.8 million   and   $18.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our accounting policy for the recognition of compensation expense for awards with pro-rata vesting is to expense the costs ratably over the vesting periods. 
    
  Additionally, HEP maintains a share-based compensation plan for Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. s non-employee directors and certain executives and employees. Compensation cost attributable to HEP s share-based compensation plan was   $0.7 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.9 million   and   $3.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
  Under our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, we grant certain officers and other key employees restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards with awards generally vesting over a period of   one   to   three   years. Restricted stock award recipients are generally entitled to all the rights of absolute ownership of the restricted shares from the date of grant including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends. Upon vesting, restrictions on the restricted shares lapse at which time they convert to common shares. In addition, we grant non-employee directors restricted stock unit awards, which typically vest over a period of one year and are payable in stock. The fair value of each restricted stock and restricted stock unit award is measured based on the grant date market price of our common shares and is amortized over the respective vesting period. 
    
  A summary of restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , restricted stock and restricted stock units vested having a grant date fair value of   $0.4 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $11.2 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.1   years. 
    
  Performance Share Units 
  Under our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, we grant certain officers and other key employees performance share units, which are payable in stock upon meeting certain criteria over the service period, and generally vest over a period of   three   years. Under the terms of our performance share unit grants, awards are subject to  financial performance  and  market performance  criteria. Financial performance is based on our financial performance compared to a peer group of independent refining companies, while market performance is based on the relative standing of total shareholder return achieved by HollyFrontier compared to peer group companies. The number of shares ultimately issued under these awards can range from   zero   to   200%   of target award amounts. As of   September 30, 2016  , estimated share payouts for outstanding non-vested performance share unit awards averaged approximately   80%   of target amounts.

A summary of performance share unit activity and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $8.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance share units having a grant date fair value of   $46.04   per unit. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.2   years. 

NOTE 6: 
    Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments in Marketable Securities 
       
  Our investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016   consisted of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. 
    
  We currently invest in marketable debt securities with the maximum maturity or put date of any individual issue generally not greater than   one   year from the date of purchase, which are usually held until maturity. All of these instruments are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. Interest income is recorded as earned. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon sale or maturity, realized gains on our marketable debt securities are recognized as interest income. These gains are computed based on the specific identification of the underlying cost of the securities, net of unrealized gains and losses previously reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities are due to changes in market prices and are considered temporary. 
    
  The following is a summary of our marketable securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Interest income recognized on our marketable securities was   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.4 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    Inventories 
       
  Inventory consists of the following components:   

(1) 
    Other raw materials and unfinished products include feedstocks and blendstocks, other than crude. 
              (2) 
    Finished products include gasolines, jet fuels, diesels, lubricants, asphalts, LPG s and residual fuels. 
              (3) 
    Process chemicals include additives and other chemicals. 
       
  Inventories, which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market, reflect a valuation reserve of   $430.2 million   and   $624.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The   December 31, 2015   market reserve of   $624.5 million   was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve. A new market reserve of   $430.2 million   was established as of   September 30, 2016   based on market conditions and prices at that time. The effect of the change in lower of cost or market reserve was an increase to cost of goods sold totaling   $0.3 million   and   $225.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a decrease of   $194.3 million   and an increase of   $83.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

NOTE 8: 
    Environmental 
       
  Environmental costs are charged to operating expenses if they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. We have ongoing investigations of environmental matters at various locations as part of our assessment process to determine the amount of environmental obligation we may have, if any, with respect to these matters for which we have recorded the estimated cost of the studies. Liabilities are recorded when site restoration and environmental remediation, cleanup and other obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are undiscounted and require judgment with respect to costs, time frame and extent of required remedial and cleanup activities and are subject to periodic adjustments based on currently available information. Recoveries of environmental costs through insurance, indemnification arrangements or other sources are included in other assets to the extent such recoveries are considered probable. 
    
  We expensed   $0.6 million   and   $3.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2.0 million   and   $7.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for environmental remediation obligations. The accrued environmental liability reflected in our consolidated balance sheets was   $94.5 million   and   $98.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of which   $80.2 million   and   $83.5 million  , respectively, were classified as other long-term liabilities. These accruals include remediation and monitoring costs expected to be incurred over an extended period of time (up to   30   years for certain projects). The amount of our accrued liability could increase in the future when the results of ongoing investigations become known, are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.

HollyFrontier Credit Agreement 
  We have a   $1 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in   July 2019   (the  HollyFrontier Credit Agreement ), which may be used for revolving credit loans and letters of credit from time to time and is available to fund general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement is recourse to HollyFrontier. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received advances totaling   $315.0 million   and repaid   $315.0 million   under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants, had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $4.4 million   under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement.  
    
  HEP Credit Agreement 
  In March 2016, HEP amended its senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in   November 2018   (the  HEP Credit Agreement ), increasing the size of the facility from   $850 million   to   $1.2 billion  . The HEP Credit Agreement is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution payments and working capital and for general partnership purposes. It is also available to fund letters of credit up to a   $50 million   sub-limit. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , HEP received advances totaling   $310.5 million   and repaid   $642.5 million   under the HEP Credit Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , HEP was in compliance with all of its covenants, had outstanding borrowings of   $380.0 million   and no outstanding letters of credit under the HEP Credit Agreement.  
    
  HEP s obligations under the HEP Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of HEP s assets. Indebtedness under the HEP Credit Agreement involves recourse to HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P., its general partner, and is guaranteed by HEP s wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any recourse to the general partner would be limited to the extent of HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P. s assets, which other than its investment in HEP are not significant. HEP s creditors have no recourse to our other assets. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  HollyFrontier Senior Notes 
  In March 2016, we issued   $250 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes (the  HollyFrontier Senior Notes ) maturing   April 2026  . The HollyFrontier Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 
    
  In June 2015, we redeemed our   $150.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.875%   senior notes maturing November 2018 at a redemption cost of   $155.2 million   at which time we recognized a   $1.4 million   early extinguishment loss consisting of a   $5.2 million   debt redemption premium, net of an unamortized premium of   $3.8 million  .

  In March 2016, we extinguished a financing obligation at a cost of   $39.5 million   and recognized an   $8.7 million   loss on the early termination. The financing obligation related to a sale and lease-back of certain crude oil tankage that we sold to an affiliate of Plains in October 2009 for   $40.0 million  .  
    
  HollyFrontier Term Loan 
  In April 2016, we entered into a   $350 million   senior unsecured term loan (the  HollyFrontier Term Loan ) maturing in April 2019. The HollyFrontier Term Loan is fully drawn and may be used for general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the HollyFrontier Term Loan is recourse to HollyFrontier. 
    
  HEP Senior Notes 
  HEP has   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.5%   senior notes maturing   March 2020  . 
    
  In July 2016, HEP issued   $400 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6.0%   HEP senior notes maturing in 2024 in a private placement. HEP used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under the HEP Credit Agreement.  
    
  The   6.5%   and   6.0%   HEP senior notes (collectively, the  HEP Senior Notes ) are unsecured and impose certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on HEP s ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, pay distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into mergers. At any time when the HEP Senior Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody s and Standard   Poor s and no default or event of default exists, HEP will not be subject to many of the foregoing covenants. Additionally, HEP has certain redemption rights under the HEP Senior Notes.

NOTE 10:   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  Commodity Price Risk Management 
  Our primary market risk is commodity price risk. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in crude oil and refined products, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity price swaps, forward purchase and sales and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with respect to: 
             
    our inventory positions; 
                
    natural gas purchases; 
                
    costs of crude oil and related grade differentials; 
                
    prices of refined products; and 
                
    our refining margins.

Accounting Hedges 
  We have swap contracts serving as cash flow hedges against price risk on forecasted purchases of natural gas. We also periodically have forward sales contracts that lock in the prices of future sales of crude oil and refined product and swap contracts serving as cash flow hedges against price risk on forecasted purchases of WTI crude oil and forecasted sales of refined product. These contracts have been designated as accounting hedges and are measured at fair value with offsetting adjustments (gains/losses) recorded directly to other comprehensive income. These fair value adjustments are later reclassified to earnings as the hedging instruments mature. On a quarterly basis, hedge ineffectiveness is measured by comparing the change in fair value of the swap contracts against the expected future cash inflows/outflows on the respective transaction being hedged. Any hedge ineffectiveness is also recognized in earnings. 
    
  The following table presents the pre-tax effect on other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and earnings due to fair value adjustments and maturities of commodity price swaps and forward sales under hedge accounting:

As of   September 30, 2016  , we have the following notional contract volumes related to outstanding derivative instruments serving as cash flow hedges against price risk on forecasted transactions: 

In   2013  , we dedesignated certain commodity price swaps (long positions) that previously received hedge accounting treatment. These contracts now serve as economic hedges against price risk on forecasted natural gas purchases totaling   12,000,000   MMBTU s to be purchased ratably through 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have an unrealized loss of $  1.4 million   classified in accumulated other comprehensive income that relates to the application of hedge accounting prior to dedesignation that is amortized as a charge to operating expenses as the contracts mature. 
    
  Economic Hedges 
  We also have swap contracts that serve as economic hedges (derivatives used for risk management, but  not designated as accounting hedges) to fix our purchase price on forecasted purchases of WTI crude oil, and to lock in basis spread differentials on forecasted purchases of crude oil and natural gas. Also, we have NYMEX futures contracts to lock in prices on forecasted purchases of inventory. These contracts are measured at fair value with offsetting adjustments (gains/losses) recorded directly to income. 
    
  The following table presents the pre-tax effect on income due to maturities and fair value adjustments of our economic hedges: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we have the following notional contract volumes related to our outstanding derivative contracts serving as economic hedges:

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  HEP uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP had two interest rate swap contracts with identical terms that hedge its exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on   $150.0 million   in credit agreement advances. The swaps effectively convert   $150.0 million   of LIBOR based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of   0.74%   plus an applicable margin of   2.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  , which equaled an effective interest rate of   2.99%  . Both of these swap contracts mature in July 2017 and have been designated as cash flow hedges. To date, there has been no ineffectiveness on these cash flow hedges. 
    
  The following table presents the pre-tax effect on other comprehensive income and earnings due to fair value adjustments and maturities of HEP s interest rate swaps under hedge accounting:

  In May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a   $1 billion   share repurchase program, which replaced all existing share repurchase programs, authorizing us to repurchase common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate, regulatory and other relevant considerations. This program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to   $178.8 million   under this stock repurchase program. In addition, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase shares in an amount sufficient to offset shares issued under our compensation programs.

    Segment Information 
       
  Our operations are organized into   two   reportable segments, Refining and HEP. Our operations that are not included in the Refining and HEP segments are included in Corporate and Other. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and are included in Consolidations and Eliminations. 
    
  The Refining segment represents the operations of the El Dorado, Tulsa, Navajo, Cheyenne and Woods Cross Refineries and HFC Asphalt (aggregated as a reportable segment). Refining activities involve the purchase and refining of crude oil and wholesale and branded marketing of refined products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel. These petroleum products are primarily marketed in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Additionally, the Refining segment includes specialty lubricant products produced at our Tulsa Refineries that are marketed throughout North America and are distributed in Central and South America. HFC Asphalt operates various asphalt terminals in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma. 
    
  The HEP segment includes all of the operations of HEP, which owns and operates logistics and refinery assets consisting of petroleum product and crude oil pipelines, terminals, tankage, loading rack facilities and processing units in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. The HEP segment also includes a   75%   ownership interest in UNEV (a consolidated subsidiary of HEP); a   50%   ownership interest in each of the Frontier Pipeline, Osage Pipeline and the Cheyenne Pipeline and a   25%   ownership interest in the SLC Pipeline. Revenues from the HEP segment are earned through transactions with unaffiliated parties for pipeline transportation, rental and terminalling operations as well as revenues relating to pipeline transportation services provided for our refining operations. Due to certain basis differences, our reported amounts for the HEP segment may not agree to amounts reported in HEP s periodic public filings. 
    
  The accounting policies for our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  This Item 2 contains  forward-looking  statements. See  Forward-Looking Statements  at the beginning of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. References herein to HollyFrontier Corporation ( HollyFrontier ) include HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC )  Plain English  guidelines, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been written in the first person. In this document, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  refer only to HollyFrontier and its consolidated subsidiaries or to HollyFrontier or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person with certain exceptions. Generally, the words  we,   our,   ours  and  us  include Holly Energy Partners, L.P. ( HEP ) and its subsidiaries as consolidated subsidiaries of HollyFrontier, unless when used in disclosures of transactions or obligations between HEP and HollyFrontier or its other subsidiaries. This document contains certain disclosures of agreements that are specific to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries and do not necessarily represent obligations of HollyFrontier. When used in descriptions of agreements and transactions,  HEP  refers to HEP and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are principally an independent petroleum refiner that produces high-value refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, specialty lubricant products, and specialty and modified asphalt. We own and operate refineries having a combined nameplate crude oil processing capacity of 457,000 barrels per day that serve markets throughout the Mid-Continent, Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Our refineries are located in El Dorado, Kansas (the  El Dorado Refinery ), Tulsa, Oklahoma (the,  Tulsa Refineries ), which comprise two production facilities, the Tulsa West and East facilities, Artesia, New Mexico, which operates in conjunction with crude, vacuum distillation and other facilities situated 65 miles away in Lovington, New Mexico (collectively, the  Navajo Refinery ), Cheyenne, Wyoming (the  Cheyenne Refinery ) and Woods Cross, Utah (the  Woods Cross Refinery ). 
    
  On October 29, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, 9952110 Canada Inc. ( Purchaser ), entered into a share purchase agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. ( Suncor ) to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. ( PCLI ), for cash consideration of CAD $1.125 billion (or approximately $845 million based on the exchange rate at time of signing), subject to customary adjustments at closing. The PCLI plant, located in Mississauga, Ontario, is the largest producer of base oils in Canada with 15,600 BPD of lubricant production capacity, and is the only North American producer of high margin Group III base oils. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, PCLI and the Purchaser will enter into various commercial and lease agreements with Suncor. The share purchase agreement provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants, and provides for the payment of fees by the Purchaser to Suncor upon the termination of the share purchase agreement under certain circumstances, including failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. We expect to fund the transaction with a combination of debt and cash on hand. 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders was   $74.5 million   compared to   $196.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net loss attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders was   $(313.6) million   compared to net income of   $784.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Included in our financial results for the current year to date period were non-cash items consisting of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, offset by an inventory reserve adjustment.   Third   quarter earnings reflect weak refining margins across the industry, with overall gross refining margin per produced barrel decreasing   50%   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Pursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard 2 ( RFS2 ) regulations, which increased the volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation s fuel supply. The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of  renewable fuels  to their petroleum products or purchase credits, known as renewable identification numbers ( RINs ), in lieu of such blending. Compliance with RFS2 significantly increases our cost of products sold, with RINs costs totaling approximately $63.0 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Year-over-year increased costs of ethanol blended into our petroleum products, which exceeded the cost of crude oil, also contributed to lower refining margins for the quarter.

     Table of Content  

OUTLOOK 
    
  Our profitability is affected by the spread, or differential, between the market prices for crude oil on the world market (which is based on the price for Brent, North Sea Crude) and the price for inland U.S. crude oil (which is based on the price for WTI). We expect continued volatility in the pricing relationship between inland and coastal crude, currently averaging in the range of $1.00 to $(1.00) per barrel, and based on market forecasts, expected to average $2.00 to $5.00 per barrel over the next few years. 
    
  Our RINs costs are material and represent a cost of products sold. The price of RINs may be extremely volatile due to real or perceived future shortages in RINs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are purchasing RINs in order to meet approximately half of our renewable fuel requirements. 
    
  A more detailed discussion of our financial and operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the following sections.

    Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as  EBITDA,  is calculated as net income plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization.  
       
           (2) 
     Adjusted EBITDA  is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus (i) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and (ii) goodwill and asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations provided for under GAAP; however, the amounts included in these calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. They are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented above are reconciled to net income under  Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. 
       
  Our operations are organized into two reportable segments, Refining and HEP. See Note 15  Segment Information  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reportable segments.

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Summary 
  Net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $74.5 million   (  $0.42   per basic and diluted share), a   $121.8 million   decrease compared to net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders of   $196.3 million   (  $1.05   per basic and   1.04   per diluted share) for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income decreased due principally to a year-over-year decrease in   third   quarter refining margins. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments decreased pre-tax earnings by   $0.3 million   compared to   $225.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Refinery gross margins for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $9.83   per produced barrel from   $19.85   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Sales and Other Revenues 
  Sales and other revenues decreased   21%   from   $3,585.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $2,847.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a year-over-year decrease in   third   quarter sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes. The average sales price we received per produced barrel sold was   $73.57   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to   $61.38   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Sales and other revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include   $15.2 million   and   $14.7 million  , respectively, in HEP revenues attributable to pipeline and transportation services provided to unaffiliated parties.

     Table of Content  

Cost of Products Sold 
  Total cost of products sold decreased   19%   from   $2,879.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $2,342.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , due principally to lower crude oil costs and lower sales volumes of refined products. Additionally during   third   quarter of 2016, we recognized a   $0.3 million   lower of cost or market inventory valuation charge, a   $225.1 million   decrease compared to 2015, resulting in a new   $430.2 million   inventory reserve at   September 30, 2016  . The reserve at   September 30, 2016   is based on market conditions and prices at that time. Excluding this non-cash adjustment, the average price we paid per barrel for crude oil and feedstocks and the transportation costs of moving finished products to market decreased   4%   from   $53.72   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $51.55   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Gross Refinery Margins 
  Gross refinery margin per produced barrel decreased   50%   from   $19.85   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $9.83   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This was due to the effects of a decrease in the average per barrel sales price for refined products sold, partially offset by decreased crude oil and feedstock prices during the current year quarter. Gross refinery margin does not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments or depreciation and amortization. See  Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for a reconciliation to the income statement of prices of refined products sold and cost of products purchased. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased   3%   from   $265.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $256.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This decrease is principally due to lower maintenance costs compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   7%   from   $30.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $33.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due principally to increased costs attributable to professional services. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   4%   from   $87.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $91.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increase was due principally to depreciation and amortization attributable to capitalized improvement projects and capitalized refinery turnaround costs.  
    
  Interest Income 
  Interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.8 million   compared to   $0.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to higher investment levels in marketable debt securities during the current year quarter. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $19.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $11.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase is due to interest attributable to higher debt levels during the current year quarter relative to the same period of   2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense included   $14.4 million   and   $9.5 million  , respectively, in interest costs attributable to limited recourse debt that finances HEP operations. 
    
  Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax expense of   $22.2 million   compared to   $110.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was due principally to lower pre-tax earnings during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  . Our effective tax rates, before consideration of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were   20.2%   and   34.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate is due principally to the effects of the current year second quarter $309.3 million goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for income tax purposes.

Results of Operations     Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Summary 
  Net loss attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $(313.6) million   (  $(1.78)   per basic and diluted share), a   $1,097.6 million   decrease compared to net income attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders of   $784.0 million   (  $4.09   per basic and diluted share) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income decreased due principally to non-cash goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of of $309.3 million and $344.1 million, respectively, and a year-over-year decrease in refining margins and sales volumes, net of the effects of a year-over-year change in lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , lower of cost or market inventory reserve adjustments increased pre-tax earnings by   $194.3 million   compared to a pre-tax earnings decrease of   $83.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Collectively, the impairment charges, net of the lower of cost or market valuation benefit, reduced net income by   $448.0 million  , after tax, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Refinery gross margins for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $8.79   per produced barrel from   $18.03   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Sales and Other Revenues 
  Sales and other revenues decreased   26%   from   $10,294.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $7,580.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a year-over-year decrease in sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes. The average sales price we received per produced barrel sold was   $74.61   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   compared to   $56.43   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Sales and other revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include   $50.1 million   and   $47.4 million  , respectively, in HEP revenues attributable to pipeline and transportation services provided to unaffiliated parties. 
    
  Cost of Products Sold 
  Total cost of products sold decreased   24%   from   $7,876.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $6,020.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due principally to lower crude oil costs and lower sales volumes of refined products. Additionally, this decrease also reflects a   $194.3 million   benefit that is attributable to a reduction in the lower of cost or market reserve for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $277.7 million   increase compared to a charge of   $83.4 million   for the same period of last year. The reserve at   September 30, 2016   is based on market conditions and prices at that time. Excluding this non-cash adjustment, the average price we paid per barrel for crude oil and feedstocks and the transportation costs of moving the finished products to the marketplace decreased   16%   from   $56.58   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $47.64   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Gross Refinery Margins 
  Gross refinery margin per produced barrel decreased   51%   from   $18.03   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $8.79   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This was due to the effects of a decrease in the average per barrel sales price for refined products sold, partially offset by decreased crude oil and feedstock prices during the current year-to-date period. Gross refinery margin does not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, goodwill and asset impairment charges or depreciation and amortization. See  Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  following Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for a reconciliation to the income statement of prices of refined products sold and cost of products purchased. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased   2%   from   $775.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $760.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due principally to lower natural gas fuel costs compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   2%   from   $86.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $88.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due principally to an increase in costs attributable to professional services net of lower incentive compensation costs for the current year compared to the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
  Depreciation and amortization increased   5%   from   $255.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $269.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increase was due principally to depreciation and amortization attributable to capitalized improvement projects and capitalized refinery turnaround costs.

Goodwill and Asset Impairment 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $309.3 million and $344.8 million, respectively, that relate to our Cheyenne Refinery. See Note 1  Description of Business and Presentation of Financial Statements  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Cheyenne impairment. 
    
  Interest Income 
  Interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million   compared to   $2.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was due to lower investment levels in marketable debt securities during the year-to-date period. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $45.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $31.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to interest attributable to higher debt levels during the current year relative to the same period of   2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense included   $36.3 million   and   $27.3 million  , respectively, in interest costs attributable to limited recourse debt that finances HEP operations. 
    
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
  In March 2016, we recognized an   $8.7 million   loss on the early retirement of a financing obligation, a component of outstanding debt, upon HEP s purchase of crude oil tanks from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline L.P. ( Plains ). See Note 9  Debt  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this financing obligation. 
    
  In June 2015, we recognized a   $1.4 million   early extinguishment loss on the redemption of our $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes maturing November 2018.  
    
  Income Taxes 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded income tax expense of   $6.5 million   compared to   $446.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was due principally to a pre-tax loss during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to pre-tax earnings in the same period of   2015  . Our effective tax rates, before consideration of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were   2.5%   and   35.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate is due principally to the effects of the second quarter $309.3 million goodwill impairment charge, a significant driver of our   $255.0 million   loss before income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , that is not deductible for income tax purposes. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  HollyFrontier Credit Agreement  
  We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in July 2019 (the  HollyFrontier Credit Agreement ), which may be used for revolving credit loans and letters of credit from time to time and is available to fund general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement is recourse to HollyFrontier. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received advances totaling   $315.0 million   and repaid   $315.0 million   under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants, had no outstanding borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $4.4 million   under the HollyFrontier Credit Agreement.

At   September 30, 2016  , HEP was in compliance with all of its covenants, had outstanding borrowings of   $380.0 million   and no outstanding letters of credit under the HEP Credit Agreement.  
    
  HEP Debt Offering 
  In July 2016, HEP issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.0% HEP unsecured senior notes maturing in 2024 in a private placement. HEP used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness under the HEP Credit Agreement.  
    
  See Note 9  Debt  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt instruments. 
    
  HEP Common Unit Continuous Offering Program 
  On May 10, 2016, HEP established a continuous offering program under which HEP may issue and sell common units from time to time, representing limited partner interests, up to an aggregate gross sales amount of $200 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP has issued   703,455   units under this program, providing   $23.0 million   in net proceeds. In connection with this program and to maintain the 2% general partner interest, we made capital contributions totaling   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  HEP intends to use the net proceeds for general partnership purposes, which may include funding working capital, repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures. Amounts repaid under HEP s credit facility may be reborrowed from time to time. 
    
  HEP Private Placement Agreement 
  On September 16, 2016, HEP entered into a common unit purchase agreement in which certain purchasers agreed to purchase in a private placement 3,420,000 HEP common units, representing limited partnership interests, at a price of $30.18 per common unit. The private placement closed on October 3, 2016, at which time HEP received proceeds of approximately   $103 million  , which were used to finance a portion of the Woods Cross assets acquisition. In connection with this private placement and to maintain our 2% general partner interest in HEP, we made capital contributions totaling   $2.1 million   to HEP in October 2016. After this common unit issuance, our interest in HEP is   37%  , including the   2%   general partner interest. Additionally, HEP entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers, which requires that HEP file a registration statement with the SEC within 60 days following the closing of the private placement to register the purchased units under the Securities Act. The registration statement will be automatically effective and the units fully transferable upon filing. 
    
  Liquidity 
  We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, along with future internally generated cash flow and funds available under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient resources to fund currently planned capital projects and our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, components of our growth strategy include construction of new refinery processing units and the expansion of existing units at our facilities and selective acquisition of complementary assets for our refining operations intended to increase earnings and cash flow. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities totaled   $478.2 million  . We consider all highly-liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. These primarily consist of investments in conservative, highly-rated instruments issued by financial institutions, government and corporate entities with strong credit standings and money market funds. 
    
  In May 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program, which replaced all existing share repurchase programs, authorizing us to repurchase common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate, regulatory and other relevant considerations. This program may be discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to   $178.8 million   under this stock repurchase program. In addition, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase shares in an amount sufficient to offset shares issued under our compensation programs.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents increased   $299.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by operating and financing activities of   $444.2 million   and   $252.7 million  , respectively, exceeded the net cash used for investing activities of   $397.2 million  . Working capital increased by   $477.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Non-cash adjustments to net income consisting of depreciation and amortization, goodwill and asset impairment, lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, net loss of equity method investments, inclusive of distributions, gain on sale of assets, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, fair value changes to derivative instruments and excess tax expense from equity based compensation totaled   $777.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $311.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . Changes in working capital items increased cash flows by   $23.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a decrease of   $183.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , turnaround expenditures increased to   $104.2 million   from   $55.9 million   for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Cash Flows   Investing Activities and Planned Capital Expenditures 
    
  Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net cash flows used for investing activities were   $397.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $425.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of $28.2 million. Cash expenditures for properties, plants and equipment for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased to   $387.5 million   from   $473.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . These include HEP capital expenditures of   $48.2 million   and   $83.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In addition, in 2016, HEP purchased a 50% interest in Cheyenne Pipeline for   $42.6 million  , and in 2015, a 50% interest in Frontier Pipeline for   $54.6 million  . We received proceeds of   $0.6 million   and   $15.8 million   from the sale of assets during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Also for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we invested   $155.1 million   and   $403.0 million  , respectively, in marketable securities and received proceeds of   $187.4 million   and   $490.3 million  , respectively, from the sale or maturity of marketable securities. 
    
  Planned Capital Expenditures 
    
  HollyFrontier Corporation 
  Each year our Board of Directors approves our annual capital budget, which includes specific projects that management is authorized to undertake. Additionally, when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, additional projects may be approved. The funds appropriated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period of several years, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore, our planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures appropriated in that year s capital budget plus expenditures for projects appropriated in prior years which have not yet been completed. During   2016  , we expect to spend approximately   $450.0 million   to   $500.0 million   in cash for capital projects appropriated in   2016   and prior years. In addition, we expect to spend approximately   $110.0 million   to   $120.0 million   on refinery turnarounds. Refinery turnaround spending is amortized over the useful life of the turnaround. This expected capital and turnaround cash spending is comprised of   $75.0 million   to   $85.0 million   at the Woods Cross Refinery,   $45.0 million   to   $55.0 million   at the El Dorado Refinery,   $160.0 million   to   $175.0 million   at the Tulsa Refineries,   $125.0 million   to   $135.0 million   at the Cheyenne Refinery,   $135.0 million   to   $145.0 million   at the Navajo Refinery and   $20.0 million   to   $25.0 million   for miscellaneous other projects. 
    
  A significant portion of our current capital spending is associated with compliance-oriented capital improvements. This spending is required due to existing consent decrees (for projects including FCC unit flue gas scrubbers and tail gas treatment units), federal fuels regulations (particularly Tier3, which mandates a reduction in the sulfur content of blended gasoline), refinery waste water treatment improvements and other similar initiatives. Our refinery operations and related emissions are highly regulated at both federal and state levels, and we invest in our facilities as needed to remain in compliance with these standards. Additionally, when faced with new emissions or fuels standards, we seek to execute projects that facilitate compliance and also improve the operating costs and / or yields of associated refining processes.  
    
  El Dorado Refinery 
  Capital projects at the El Dorado Refinery include the completion of an FCC gasoline hydrotreater to meet Tier 3 gasoline requirements and a new tail gas treating unit to provide spare capacity to the existing unit. Growth projects include an upgrade project to improve reformer operation, yield and reliability. A project to improve Coker yield and capacity is currently being evaluated.  

47 

     Table of Content  

Tulsa Refineries 
  Capital spending for the Tulsa Refineries includes a project to improve FCC yields that was implemented during a turnaround that started in February 2016 and completed in March 2016.  
    
  Navajo Refinery 
  The Navajo Refinery capital spending in 2016 is primarily directed towards the installation of an FCC gasoline hydrotreater unit to address Tier 3 compliance. Additionally, the Navajo Refinery plans to increase crude capacity through targeted upgrades to several processing units that is expected to provide greater diesel and gasoline flexibility and increased diesel production. 
    
  Cheyenne Refinery 
  The Cheyenne Refinery capital spending in 2016 includes the completion of wastewater treatment plant improvements and a project to improve FCC yield and reliability that was implemented during a turnaround completed in the second quarter of 2016. An expansion to the heavy oil rack will allow an increase of asphalt and gas oil exports, and work progresses on a study to provide a redundant tail gas unit associated with the sulfur recovery process. 
    
  Woods Cross Refinery 
  We have completed construction on our existing Woods Cross expansion project, increasing crude processing capacity to 45,000 BPSD, and providing greater crude slate flexibility, which we believe will increase capacity utilization and improve overall economic returns during periods when wax crudes are in short supply. The project also included construction of new refining facilities and a new rail loading rack for intermediates and finished products associated with refining waxy crude oil.   
    
  On November 18, 2013, the Utah Division of Air Quality issued a revised air quality permit (the  Approval Order ) authorizing the expansion. On December 18, 2013, two local environmental groups filed an administrative appeal challenging the issuance of the Approval Order and seeking a stay of the Approval Order. Following an extended appeal process, the Executive Director of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality issued a final order in favor of Woods Cross on all claims on March 31, 2015, and dismissed the project opponents  arguments with prejudice. On April 27, 2015, the opponents filed a petition for review and notice of appeal with the Utah Court of Appeals challenging the agency s decision to uphold the permit and dismiss the project opponents  arguments. On August 4, 2016, the Utah Court of Appeals transferred the case to the Utah Supreme Court. The Utah Supreme Court established a supplemental briefing schedule, which ran through October 2016. Oral argument will likely not take place until early 2017. Our continued use of the expansion project facilities is subject to the Woods Cross Refinery successfully defending the Approval Order on appeal at the Utah Court of Appeals. 
    
  Regulatory compliance items or other presently existing or future environmental regulations / consent decrees could cause us to make additional capital investments beyond those described above and incur additional operating costs to meet applicable requirements, including those related to recently promulgated Federal Tier 3 gasoline standards. 
    
  HEP 
  Each year the Holly Logistic Services, L.L.C. board of directors approves HEP s annual capital budget, which specifies capital projects that HEP management is authorized to undertake. Additionally, at times when conditions warrant or as new opportunities arise, special projects may be approved. The funds allocated for a particular capital project may be expended over a period of several years, depending on the time required to complete the project. Therefore, HEP s planned capital expenditures for a given year consist of expenditures approved for capital projects included in its current year capital budget as well as, in certain cases, expenditures approved for capital projects in capital budgets for prior years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are described in  Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Certain critical accounting policies that materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements include the assessment and consolidation of variable interest entities, the use of the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method of valuing certain inventories, the amortization of deferred costs for regular major maintenance and repairs at our refineries, assessing the possible impairment of certain long-lived assets and goodwill, accounting for derivative instruments and assessing contingent liabilities for probable losses.  

49 

     Table of Content  

Inventory Valuation 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method for crude oil, unfinished and finished refined products and the average cost method for materials and supplies, or market. In periods of rapidly declining prices, LIFO inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to LIFO layers in prior periods. In addition, the use of the LIFO inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with LIFO inventory costs generated in prior periods. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve was   $430.2 million  . This amount, or a portion thereof, is subject to reversal as a reduction to cost of products sold in subsequent periods as inventories giving rise to the reserve are sold, and a new reserve is established. Such a reduction to cost of products sold could be significant if inventory values return to historical cost price levels. Additionally, further decreases in overall inventory values could result in additional charges to cost of products sold should the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve be increased.  
    
  Goodwill and Long-lived Assets:   As of   December 31, 2015  , our goodwill balance was   $2.3 billion  , with   $1.7 billion  ,   $0.3 billion   and   $0.3 billion   allocated to our El Dorado Refinery, Cheyenne Refinery and HEP reporting units, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment testing first entails a comparison of our reporting unit fair values relative to their respective carrying values. If carrying value exceeds fair value for a reporting unit, we measure goodwill impairment as the excess of the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill based on estimates of the fair value of all assets and liabilities in the reporting unit.  
  Prior to the second quarter of 2016, there had been no impairments to goodwill. 
    
  Our long-lived assets principally consist of our refining assets that are organized as refining asset groups. These refinery asset groups also constitute our individual refinery reporting units that are used for testing and measuring goodwill impairments (El Dorado and Cheyenne). Our long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and if so, assessing whether the long-lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of impairment loss measured, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset group s carrying value exceeds its fair value. 
    
  Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments 
  As of April 30, 2016, we performed interim goodwill impairment and related long-lived asset impairment testing of our El Dorado and Cheyenne Refinery reporting units after identifying a combination of events and circumstances which were indicators of potential goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, including lower than typical gross margins during the summer driving season, a current outlook of lower future gross margins, and the recent decline in our common share price which has resulted in a decrease in our market capitalization. In conjunction with our interim goodwill impairment testing performed, we first assessed the carrying values of our refining long-lived asset groups for recoverability.   
  The estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units and long-lived asset groups were derived using a combination of both income and market approaches. The income approach reflects expected future cash flows based on estimates of future crack spreads, forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. Our market approaches include both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Both methods utilize pricing multiples derived from historical market transactions of other like-kind assets. These fair value measurements involve significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). See Note 3  Fair Value Measurements  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Level 3 inputs.  
  As a result of our impairment testing during the second quarter of 2016, we determined that the carrying value of the long-lived assets of the Cheyenne Refinery had been impaired and recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of   $344.8 million  . Additionally, the carrying value of the Cheyenne Refinery s goodwill was fully impaired and a goodwill impairment charge of   $309.3 million   was also recorded. representing all of the goodwill allocated to our Cheyenne Refinery. Our interim testing did not identify any other impairment. 
  We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016 and determined the fair value of our El Dorado reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 4%. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in gross margins could result in an impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets of the El Dorado reporting unit at some point in the future. Such impairment charges could be material.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
    
  We use certain strategies to reduce some commodity price and operational risks. We do not attempt to eliminate all market risk exposures when we believe that the exposure relating to such risk would not be significant to our future earnings, financial position, capital resources or liquidity or that the cost of eliminating the exposure would outweigh the benefit. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk Management 
  Our primary market risk is commodity price risk. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in crude oil and refined products, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. We periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity price swaps and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with respect to: 
             
    our inventory positions; 
                
    natural gas purchases; 
                
    costs of crude oil and related grade differentials; 
                
    prices of refined products; and 
                
    our refining margins. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have the following notional contract volumes related to all outstanding derivative contracts used to mitigate commodity price risk: 

The following sensitivity analysis provides the hypothetical effects of market price fluctuations to the commodity positions hedged under our derivative contracts: 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  HEP uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , HEP had two interest rate swap contracts with identical terms that hedge its exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of LIBOR changes on $150.0 million in credit agreement advances. The swaps effectively convert $150.0 million of LIBOR based debt to fixed-rate debt having an interest rate of   0.74%   plus an applicable margin of   2.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  , which equaled an effective interest rate of   2.99%  . Both of these swap contracts mature in July 2017. These swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. 
    
  The market risk inherent in our fixed-rate debt is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below. 

51 

     Table of Content  

For the fixed rate HollyFrontier Senior Notes and HEP Senior Notes, changes in interest rates will generally affect fair value of the debt, but not earnings or cash flows. The outstanding principal, estimated fair value and estimated change in fair value (assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the yield-to-maturity rates) for this debt as of   September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

For the variable rate HollyFrontier Term Loan and HEP Credit Agreement, changes in interest rates would affect cash flows, but not the fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding borrowings under the HEP Credit Agreement were   $380.0 million  . By means of its cash flow hedges, HEP has effectively converted the variable rate on $150.0 million of outstanding principal to a weighted average fixed rate of   2.99%  . For the remaining unhedged HEP Credit Agreement borrowings of   $230.0 million   and the HollyFrontier Term Loan, a hypothetical 10% change in applicable interest rates would not materially affect cash flows.  
    
  Our operations are subject to hazards of petroleum processing operations, including fire, explosion and weather-related perils. We maintain various insurance coverages, including business interruption insurance, subject to certain deductibles. We are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable, coverage is unavailable, or premium costs, in our judgment, do not justify such expenditures. 
    
  Financial information is reviewed on the counterparties in order to review and monitor their financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the derivative contracts. We have not experienced, nor do we expect to experience, any difficulty in the counterparties honoring their commitments. 
    
  We have a risk management oversight committee consisting of members from our senior management. This committee oversees our risk enterprise program, monitors our risk environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate identified risks that may adversely affect the achievement of our goals.

Reconciliations to Amounts Reported Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
    
  Reconciliations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and EBITDA excluding  non-cash  lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments and goodwill and asset impairment charges ( Adjusted EBITDA ) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements. 
    
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as EBITDA, is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to HollyFrontier stockholders plus (i) interest expense, net of interest income, (ii) income tax provision, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus or minus (i) lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and (ii) goodwill and asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculations provided for under GAAP; however, the amounts included in these calculations are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. They are presented here because they are widely used financial indicators used by investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants.

Set forth below is our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.   

(1)  Includes loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $8.7 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Reconciliations of refinery operating information (non-GAAP performance measures) to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements. 
    
  Refinery gross margin and net operating margin are non-GAAP performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry. We believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis. 
    
  Refinery gross margin per barrel is the difference between average net sales price and average cost of products per barrel of produced refined products. Net operating margin per barrel is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per barrel of produced refined products. These two margins do not include the non-cash effects of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments, goodwill and asset impairment charges  or depreciation and amortization. Each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner. 
    
  Refinery Gross and Net Operating Margins 
    
  Below are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for (i) net sales, cost of products (exclusive of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment) and operating expenses, in each case averaged per produced barrel sold, and (ii) net operating margin and refinery gross margin. Due to rounding of reported numbers, some amounts may not calculate exactly.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  Commitment and Contingency Reserves 
    
  We periodically establish reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. While management believes these reserves to be adequate, future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued. 
    
  While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, based on advice of counsel, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  We are reporting the following proceedings to comply with SEC regulations which require us to disclose proceedings arising under federal, state or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. Our respective subsidiaries have or will develop corrective action plans regarding these disclosures that will be implemented in consultation with the respective federal and / or state agencies. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, although none are currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
    
  Cheyenne 
  HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining LLC ( HFCR ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, completed certain environmental audits at the Cheyenne Refinery regarding compliance with federal and state environmental requirements. By letters dated October 5, 2012, November 7, 2012, and January 10, 2013, and pursuant to the EPA s audit policy to the extent applicable, HFCR submitted reports to the EPA voluntarily disclosing non-compliance with certain emission limitations, reporting requirements, and provisions of a 2009 federal consent decree. By letters dated October 31, 2012; February 6, 2013; June 21, 2013; July 9, 2013 and July 25, 2013, and pursuant to applicable Wyoming audit statutes, HFCR submitted environmental audit reports to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality ( WDEQ ) voluntarily disclosing non-compliance with certain notification, reporting, and other provisions of the refinery s state air permit and other environmental regulatory requirements. No further action has been taken by either agency at this time. 
    
  Tulsa 
  HollyFrontier Tulsa Refining LLC ( HFTR ) manufactures paraffin and hydrocarbon waxes at its Tulsa West facility. On March 11, 2014, the EPA issued a notice to HFTR of possible violations of certain provisions of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act in connection with the manufacture of certain of these products. HFTR and the EPA met and are working productively towards a settlement of this matter. 
    
  Other  
    
  We are a party to various other litigation and proceedings that we believe, based on advice of counsel, will not either individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
       
  Except for the additional risk factor information below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part 1,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and in Part II,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and in our   2015   Form 10-K and June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.

Our pending PCLI acquisition may not be consummated.     Failure to complete the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.     
    
  The PCLI acquisition is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be consummated. If the closing of the acquisition is substantially delayed or does not occur at all, or if the terms of the acquisition are required to be modified substantially due to regulatory concerns, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition fully or at all. Certain of the conditions remaining to be satisfied include the absence of a law or order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the share purchase agreement, approval under the Investment Canada Act, and the expiration of any waiting periods under the Competition Act (Canada) and Hart-Scott Rodino Act, as amended, with respect to the acquisition. We will also incur substantial transaction costs whether or not the acquisition is completed. Any failure to complete the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our future business and financial results. 
    
  The anticipated benefits of our pending PCLI acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected  .  
    
  The PCLI acquisition involves the operation of businesses in other countries. The acquisition will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating the PCLI business with our business. Delays in this process could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price. Even if we are able to integrate our business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame.

  CERTIFICATION 
  I, George J. Damiris, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of HollyFrontier Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
