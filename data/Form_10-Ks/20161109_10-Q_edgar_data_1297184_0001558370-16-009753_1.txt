1.  Genera  l 

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a California corporation, was incorporated on February 29, 1996, and merged with and into Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in July 2004 (together with its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as  the Company ). The Company is a specialty pharmaceutical company that primarily develops, manufactures, markets, and sells generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products including products with high technical barriers to market entry. Additionally, the Company sells insulin active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API products. Most of the Company s products are used in hospital or urgent care clinical settings and are primarily contracted and distributed through group purchasing organizations and drug wholesalers. The Company s insulin API products are sold to other pharmaceutical companies for use in their own products and are being used by the Company in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. The Company s inhalation products will be primarily distributed through drug retailers once they are brought to market. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, have been condensed or omitted from the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from the audited financial statements. The accompanying interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, all such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Company s results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows that it may achieve in future periods. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

All significant intercompany activity has been eliminated in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Some information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company.  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: International Medication Systems, Limited, or IMS; Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Armstrong; Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or ANP; Nanjing Letop Fine Chemistry Co., Ltd., or Letop, Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals, S.A.S., or AFP, Amphastar UK Ltd., or AUK, and International Medication Systems (UK) Limited, or IMS UK.  

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal accounting estimates include: determination of allowances for doubtful accounts and discounts, provision for chargebacks, liabilities for product returns,

reserves for excess or unsellable inventory, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill, self-insured claims, workers  compensation liabilities, litigation reserves, stock price volatilities for share-based compensation expense, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, and liabilities for uncertain income tax positions. 

Foreign Currency  

The functional currency of the Company, its Chinese subsidiary, ANP, and its U.K. subsidiary, AUK, is the U.S. dollar, or USD. ANP maintains its books of record in Chinese Yuan. These books are remeasured into the functional currency of USD using the current or historical exchange rates. The resulting currency remeasurement adjustments and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses are reflected in the Company s statements of operations.   

The Company s   French subsidiary, AFP, Chinese subsidiary, Letop, and U.K. subsidiary, IMS UK, maintain their books of record in Euros, Chinese Yuan, and Great Britain Pounds, respectively, which are the local currencies and have been determined to be their respective functional currencies. These books are translated into USD using average exchange rates during the period.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date.  Equity is translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the equity transactions. Translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders  equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).   The gains or losses of intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in other comprehensive income (loss).  The gains and losses of intercompany foreign currency transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were a $0.3 million gain and a $0.6 million gain, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were a $0.3 million gain and a $1.6 million loss, respectively. 

Additionally, the Company does not undertake hedging transactions to cover its foreign currency exposure. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company included its foreign currency translation adjustment as part of its comprehensive income (loss).   

Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these items. A majority of the Company s long-term obligations consist of variable rate debt, and their carrying value approximates fair value as the stated borrowing rates are comparable to rates currently offered to the Company for instruments with similar maturities. However, the Company has one fixed-rate, long-term mortgage for which the carrying value differs from the fair value and is not remeasured on a recurring basis (see Note 12).  

Deferred Income Taxes 

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has adopted the with-and-without methodology for determining when excess tax benefits from the exercise of share based awards are realized. Under the with-and-without methodology, current year operating loss deductions and prior-year operating loss carryforwards are deemed to be utilized prior to the utilization of current-year excess tax benefits from share based awards.

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. Fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. In determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition, the Company may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or may complete some or all of the valuations internally. In either case, the Company takes full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill reflects the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received.  

Acquisition-related costs that the Company incurs to effect a business combination are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance for companies in all industries. The new standard provides guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers, unless the contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. It also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets. This guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented or a modified retrospective approach and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be the Company s fiscal 2018. The Company has not yet evaluated the potential impact of adopting the guidance on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will require management to evaluate if there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, to disclose this in both interim and annual reporting periods. This guidance will become effective for the Company s annual filing for the period ending December 31, 2016, and interim reporting periods thereafter, and allows for early adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of the guidance will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, or NRV, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under the new guidance, inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which eliminates the need to determine replacement cost and evaluate whether it is above the ceiling (NRV) or below the floor (NRV less a normal profit margin). The guidance defines NRV as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein. The standard will be effective for the Company for the first quarter of the Company s fiscal 2017. Early application is permitted. The new guidance must be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes.  Under existing standards, deferred taxes for each tax-paying jurisdiction are presented as a net current asset or liability and net long-term asset or liability. To simplify presentation, the new guidance will require that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with related valuation allowances, be classified as long-term on the balance sheet. As a result, each tax-paying jurisdiction will now only have one net long-term deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change

Table of Contents  

AMPHASTAR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company has elected to adopt the guidance early and apply the guidance prospectively. Therefore, prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The reclassification of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities does not have any impact on the Company s net income or cash flow; thus, the adoption of the guidance does not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and which requires substantially all leases to be recognized by lessees on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. This guidance will become effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2019, and all annual and interim reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that is aimed at improving the employee share-based payment accounting. The standard update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments and involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based transactions, including the potential timing of expenses, the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that is aimed at providing financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. The standard update changes the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, requiring presentation at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The guidance is effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that is aimed at addressing certain issues regarding classifications of certain cash receipt and cash payment on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice was identified. The guidance is effective for the Company s interim and annual reporting periods during the year ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this accounting guidance will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

3.  Business Acquisitions 

Acquisition of International Medication Systems (UK) Limited from UCB PHARMA GmbH 

In August 2016, the Company s newly established UK subsidiary, AUK, acquired IMS UK, a UK-based subsidiary of UCB PHARMA GmbH, including its trademarks, assets related to the products, as well as marketing authorizations for 33 products in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities. The Company paid $7.7 million in cash as consideration for the transaction. The Company plans to transfer the manufacturing

of the purchased products to its facilities in California. The transfer will require approval of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and other related regulatory agencies before the products can be sold by the Company. The transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. 

The Company s accounting for this acquisition is preliminary specifically related to the fair value estimation of identified intangible assets. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed include marketing authorizations of $9.2 million, manufacturing equipment of $0.1 million, and deferred tax liability of $1.6 million. The acquired marketing authorizations intangible assets are subject to a straight-line amortization over a useful life of approximately 10 years. The Company s estimates and assumptions are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information for its estimates during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).  

Acquisition of fourteen injectable products from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 

In March 2016, the Company acquired 14 abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC for $4.0 million. The Company plans to transfer the manufacturing of these products to its facilities in California, which will require U.S. Food   Drug Administration, or FDA approval before the products can be launched. The Company has concluded that this transaction will be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. 

The Company s accounting for this acquisition is preliminary specifically related to the fair value estimation of identified intangible assets. The ANDA is estimated to have a fair value of $4.0 million, which is subject to a straight-line amortization over a useful life of approximately 15 years. The Company s estimates and assumptions are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information for its estimates during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).  

Acquisition of Nanjing Letop Medical Technology Co. Ltd. 

In January 2016, the Company s Chinese subsidiary, ANP, acquired Nanjing Letop Medical Technology Co. Ltd. for $1.7 million consisting of $0.8 million in cash and a deposit of $0.9 million that ANP had previously paid to Letop and which was effectively eliminated upon the consummation of the transaction. The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. The Company recognized $1.4 million of acquired assets, $0.1 million of assumed liabilities, and $0.4 million of goodwill. Letop had previously supplied ANP with intermediates used in making various active pharmaceutical ingredients. In March 2016, the acquired subsidiary was renamed Nanjing Letop Fine Chemistry Co., Ltd.

On April 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of the Merck Sharpe   Dohme s API manufacturing business in  ragny-sur-Epte, France, or the Merck API Transaction, which manufactures porcine insulin API and recombinant human insulin API, or RHI API. The purchase price of the transaction totaled  24.8 million, or $34.4 million on April 30, 2014, subject to certain customary post closing adjustments and currency exchange rate fluctuations. The terms of the purchase include multiple payments over four years as follows (see Note 12): 

In order to facilitate the acquisition, the Company established AFP in France. The Company is continuing the current site manufacturing activities, which consist of the manufacturing of porcine insulin API and RHI API. As part of the transaction, the Company has entered into various additional agreements, including various supply agreements, as well as the assignment and/or licensing of patents under which Merck was operating at this facility. In addition, certain existing customer agreements have been assigned to AFP.  

4.  Revenue Recognition 

Generally, revenue is recognized at the time of product delivery to the Company s customers. In some cases, revenue is recognized at the time of shipment when stipulated by the terms of the sale agreements. The Company also records profit-sharing revenue stemming from a distribution agreement with Actavis, Inc., or Actavis. This distribution agreement is in the process of being terminated (see Note 16). Profit-sharing revenue is recognized at the time Actavis sells the products to its customers. Revenues derived from contract manufacturing services are recognized when third-party products are shipped to customers, after the customer has accepted test samples of the products to be shipped. 

The Company does not recognize product revenue unless the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) transfer of title has occurred, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Furthermore, the Company does not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met. The Company estimates and records reductions to revenue for discounts, product returns, and pricing adjustments, such as wholesaler chargebacks, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.  

The Company s accounting policy is to review each agreement involving contract development and manufacturing services to determine if there are multiple revenue-generating activities that constitute more than one unit of accounting. Revenues are recognized for each unit of accounting based on revenue recognition criteria relevant to that unit. The Company does not have any revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. 

Provision for Wholesaler Chargebacks 

The provision for chargebacks is a significant estimate used in the recognition of revenue. As part of its sales terms with wholesale customers, the Company agrees to reimburse wholesalers for differences between the gross sales prices at which the Company sells its products to wholesalers and the actual prices of such products at the time wholesalers resell them under the Company s various contractual arrangements with third parties such as hospitals and group purchasing

organizations. The Company estimates chargebacks at the time of sale to wholesalers based on wholesaler inventory stocking levels, historic chargeback rates, and current contract pricing. 

The provision for chargebacks is reflected in net revenues and a reduction to accounts receivable. The following table is an analysis of the chargeback provision:  

Changes in chargeback provision from period to period are primarily dependent on the Company s sales to its wholesalers, the level of inventory held by the wholesalers, and on the wholesaler s customer mix. The approach that the Company uses to estimate chargebacks has been consistently applied for all periods presented. Variations in estimates have been historically small. The Company continually monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that the actual chargebacks may differ from the estimates. The settlement of chargebacks generally occurs within 30 days after the sale to wholesalers. 

Accrual for Product Returns 

The Company offers most customers the right to return qualified excess or expired inventory for partial credit; however, products sold to Actavis are non-returnable. The Company s product returns primarily consist of the returns of expired products from sales made in prior periods.   Returned products cannot be resold.   At the time product revenue is recognized, the Company records an accrual for estimated returns. The accrual is based, in part, upon the historical relationship of product returns to sales and customer contract terms. The Company also assesses other factors that could affect product returns including market conditions, product obsolescence, and the introduction of new competition.  Although these factors do not normally give the Company s customers the right to return products outside of the regular return policy, the Company realizes that such factors could ultimately lead to increased returns. The Company analyzes these situations on a case-by-case basis and makes adjustments to the product return reserve as appropriate. 

The provision for product returns is reflected in net revenues. The following table is an analysis of product return liability: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,    the Company s aggregate product return rate was   1.1% and 1.1%    of qualified sales, respectively.

5.  Income (loss) per Share 

Basic income (loss) per share is calculated based upon the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share gives effect to all potential dilutive shares outstanding during the period, such as stock options, nonvested deferred stock units and restricted stock units (collectively referred to herein as  RSUs ), and shares issuable under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, options to purchase 1,357,154 shares of stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $29.31 per share, were excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share because the effect from the assumed exercise of these options would be anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, options to purchase 4,510,729 shares of stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $19.84 per share, were excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share because the effect from the assumed exercise of these options would be anti-dilutive. 

As the Company reported a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the diluted net loss per share, as reported, is equal to the basic net loss per share since the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options, vesting of nonvested RSUs, and issuance of common shares under the ESPP are anti-dilutive. Total shares excluded from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, net loss per share were 12,471,789 stock options, 877,665 nonvested RSUs, and 165,167 shares issuable under the ESPP. 

The following table provides the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for each of the periods presented: 

6.  Segment Reporting  

The Company s business is the development, manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The Company has established two reporting segments that each report to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM, as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The Company s performance is assessed and resources are allocated by the CODM based on the following two reportable segments: 

Finished pharmaceutical products     

Active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API     

The finished pharmaceutical products segment manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, Cortrosyn     , Amphadase     , naloxone, lidocaine jelly, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment manufactures and distributes RHI and porcine insulin. The Company also uses RHI for internal product development.

Selected financial information by reporting segment is presented below: 

The Company manages its business segments to the gross profit level and manages its operating and other costs on a company-wide basis. The Company does not identify total assets by segment for internal purposes, as the Company s CODM does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets. 

Prior to the Merck API Transaction on April 30, 2014, Merck notified the Company of several environmental items that were not in alignment with Merck s internal policies and procedures. None of these items were in violation of any French environmental law or regulation. The Company has assessed the nature of the remedial actions to be undertaken and since April 30, 2014, recorded the related expenses of  0.6 million as incurred in cost of sales within the API segment. Based on the letter of understanding signed in conjunction with the acquisition on April 30, 2014, the Company and Merck further entered into an agreement on May 11, 2016, pursuant to which Merck shall reimburse the Company for the costs to complete the remedial actions up to  6.0 million. Accordingly, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded the reimbursement of  0.6 million for the expenses already incurred as a reduction of cost of sales within the API segment. 

The amount of net revenues in the finished pharmaceutical products segment is presented below:

Net revenues and carrying values of long-lived assets of enterprises by geographic regions are as follows: 

7.  Customer and Supplier Concentration 

Customer Concentrations 

Three large wholesale drug distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, or AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, Inc. or Cardinal Health, and McKesson Corporation, or McKesson, are all distributors of the Company s products, as well as suppliers of a broad range of health care products. Actavis had exclusive marketing rights of the Company s enoxaparin product to the U.S. retail pharmacy market (see Note 16). MannKind Corporation began buying RHI API from the Company in December 2014. The Company considers these five customers to be its major customers, as each individually, and these customers collectively, represented a significant percentage of the Company s net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The following table provides accounts receivable and net revenues information for these major customers: 

(1) 

Effective June 30, 2016, the Company and Actavis agreed to terminate the agreement upon the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies the Company in writing that Actavis has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders (see Note 16).     

Supplier Concentrations 

The Company depends on suppliers for raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other components that are subject to stringent FDA requirements. Some of these materials may only be available from one or a limited number of sources. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these materials may take a substantial amount of time, as suppliers must be approved by the FDA. Furthermore, a significant portion of raw materials may only be available from foreign sources. If the Company is unable to secure, on a timely basis, sufficient quantities of the materials that it depends on to manufacture and market its products, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

8.  Fair Value Measurements 

The accounting standards of the FASB define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability at the measurement date (an exit price). These standards also establish a hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value of an asset or liability, as described below: 

Level 1     Inputs to measure fair value are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets on identical assets or liabilities;     

Level 2     Inputs to measure fair value are based on the following: a) quoted prices in active markets on similar assets or liabilities, b) quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or c) observable (other than quoted prices) or collaborated observable market data used in a pricing model from which the fair value is derived; and      

Level 3     Inputs to measure fair value are unobservable and the assets or liabilities have little, if any, market activity; these inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on the best information available in the circumstances.     

The Company measures fair value based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  

The Company classifies its cash equivalents and restricted short-term investments as Level 1 assets, as they are valued on a recurring basis using quoted market prices with no valuation adjustments applied. The Company does not hold any Level 2 or Level 3 instruments that are measured for fair value on a recurring basis.  

The fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows: 

The fair value of the Company s cash equivalents includes money market accounts, money market funds, Money Market Insured Deposit Account Service and Insured Cash Sweep accounts. Restricted short-term investments consist of certificate of deposit accounts that expire within 12 months for which market prices are readily available. The restrictions placed on the certificate of deposit accounts have a negligible effect on the fair value of these financial assets; these funds are restricted to meet the Company s obligation for workers  compensation claims.

Short-term investments primarily consist of held-to-maturity municipal bonds with original maturities greater than three months. The municipal bonds are carried at amortized cost in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, which approximates their fair value determined based on Level 2 inputs. The Company does not intend to and will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

The Company adopted the required fair value measurements and disclosures provisions related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These items primarily include long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets for which the fair value of assets is determined as part of the related impairment test. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no significant adjustments to fair value for nonfinancial assets or liabilities. 

9.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

The table below shows the weighted-average life, original cost, accumulated amortization, and net book value by major intangible asset classification as of the dates set forth below:  

*  Intangible assets with indefinite lives have an indeterminable average life. 

(1)    In August 2016, the Company acquired International Medication Systems (UK) Limited from UCB PHARMA GmbH for $7.7 million. The fair value of the marketing authorization was $9.2 million as of the acquisition date. The accounting for this transaction is preliminary (see Note 3). 

(2)    In March 2016, the Company acquired 14 ANDAs representing 11 different injectable chemical entities from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC for $4.0 million. The accounting for this transaction is preliminary (see Note 3).

Goodwill 

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows: 

Primatene      Trademark 

In January 2009, the Company acquired the exclusive rights to the trademark, domain name, website and domestic marketing, distribution and selling rights related to Primatene      Mist, an over-the-counter bronchodilator product, for a total consideration of $29.2 million, which is its carrying value as of September 30, 2016. 

In determining the useful life of the trademark, the Company considered the following: the expected use of the intangible; the longevity of the brand; the legal, regulatory and contractual provisions that affect their maximum useful life; the Company s ability to renew or extend the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial costs; effects of the regulatory environment; expected changes in distribution channels; maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset; and considerations for obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.  

As a result of environmental concerns about Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, the FDA issued a final ruling on January 16, 2009, that required the CFC formulation of its Primatene      Mist product to be phased out by December 31, 2011. The former formulation of Primatene      Mist contained CFCs as a propellant; however, the Company intends to use the trademark for a future version of Primatene      that utilizes hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, as a propellant. 

In 2013, the Company filed a new drug application, or NDA, for Primatene      Mist and received a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date set for May 2014. In May 2014, the Company received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA, which required additional non-clinical information, label revisions and follow-up studies (label comprehension,

behavioral/human factors and actual use) to assess consumers  ability to use the device correctly to support approval of the product in the over-the-counter setting. The Company met with the FDA in October 2014 to discuss preliminary data results and to clarify the FDA requirements for further studies. The Company received further advice regarding its ongoing studies from the FDA in January 2016, and subsequently completed the human factor studies accordingly. The Company submitted the NDA amendment on June 28, 2016 and received a target response date of December 28, 2016.  However, there can be no guarantee that any amendment to the Company s NDA will result in timely approval of Primatene      Mist, or approval at all. 

Based on the Company s filed version of Primatene      Mist, the Company s response to the CRL to address the FDA s concerns, the long history of the Primatene      trademark (marketed since 1963) and the Company s perpetual rights to the trademark, the Company has determined that the trademark has an indefinite useful life. If the HFA version is approved by the FDA, it will be marketed under the same trade name; therefore, an impairment charge would not be required. 

10.  Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. Provisions are made for slow-moving, unsellable or obsolete items. Inventories consist of the following: 

11.  Property, Plant, and Equipment 

Property, plant, and equipment consist of the following: 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $2.6 million in capitalized manufacturing equipment that is intended to be used specifically for the manufacture of Primatene      Mist. The Company will continue to monitor developments with the FDA as it relates to its Primatene      indefinite lived intangible asset in determining if there is an impairment of these related fixed assets (see Note 9).

Loans with Seine-Normandie Water Agency 

In January 2015, the Company entered into three French government loans with the Seine-Normandie water agency in the aggregate amount of  0.6 million, or $0.7 million, subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. The life of the loans ranges between three to six years, includes annual equal payments and bears no interest over the life of the loans.    

As of September 30, 2016, the payment obligation had an aggregate book value of  0.4 million, or $0.4 million, subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the payment obligation was determined by using the interest rate associated with the Company s acquisition loan with Cathay Bank that bears a variable interest rate at the prime rate as published by   The Wall Street Journal  , with a minimum interest rate of 4.00%.  Such interest rate is deemed to be a Level 2 input for measuring fair value. 

Payment Obligation to Merck 

Merck Due December 2017 

On April 30, 2014, in conjunction with the Merck API Transaction, the Company entered into a commitment obligation with Merck, in the principal amount of  11.6 million, or $16.0 million, subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.  The terms of the purchase price include annual payments over four years and bear a fixed interest rate of 3.00%. The final payment to Merck relating to this obligation is due December 2017. In December 2015 and 2014, the Company made a principal payment of  3.2 million, or $3.5 million and  4.9 million, or $6.0 million, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, the payment obligation had a book value of  3.6 million, or $4.1 million, which approximates fair value. The fair value of the payment obligation was determined by using the interest rate associated with the Company s acquisition loan with Cathay Bank that bears a variable interest rate at the prime rate as published by   The Wall Street Journal  , with a minimum interest rate of 4.00%. Such interest rate is deemed to be a Level 2 input for measuring fair value. 

Covenants 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, which include a minimum current ratio, minimum debt service coverage, minimum tangible net worth, and maximum debt-to-effective-tangible-net-worth ratio, computed on a consolidated basis in some instances and on a separate-company basis in others. 

Equipment under Capital Leases 

The Company entered into leases for certain equipment under capital leasing arrangements, which will expire at various times through 2021. The cost of equipment under capital leases was $2.0 million and $1.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The accumulated depreciation of equipment under capital leases was $0.1 million and $0.7 million at September 30, 2016

and December 31, 2015, respectively. Depreciation of assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

13.  Income Taxes  

The following table sets forth the Company s income tax provision for the periods indicated: 

The Company s income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 35.2% and 32.2% of income before taxes, respectively. The Company has a full valuation allowance against its French deferred tax assets; however, a tax benefit is included in the annual effective tax rate computation due to the French entity reporting a year-to-date foreign exchange gain in other comprehensive income. The blended effective income tax rate expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, is 32.4%. This effective tax rate factors in various permanent differences, including domestic deductions, the impact of foreign operations, and various credits. The Company s income tax benefit of 29.7% and 50.1% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, factored in similar permanent items, as well as the impact of its foreign operations. 

Valuation Allowance 

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Ultimately, the realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of future taxable income. M  anagement considers sources of taxable income such as income in prior carryback periods, future reversal of existing deferred taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and projected future taxable income.       

In connection with the AFP purchase accounting in 2014, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset of  3.2 million, or $4.4 million, subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations, with an offsetting entry to goodwill, since management did not believe that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized. In March 2015, the Company reversed the  3.2 million, or $3.3 million, subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations, deferred tax valuation allowance in conjunction with the transfer of AFP s intangible assets from France to the United States. The difference in U.S. dollars relates to the currency exchange rate fluctuation, which is recorded in the Company s accumulated other comprehensive loss as a foreign currency translation adjustment. 

In 2015, the Company assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets for AFP. Due to the potential impact of reduced revenues from the MannKind contract and other factors, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of AFP would be realized. Therefore, the Company established a full valuation allowance of $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015, and continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on all AFP deferred tax assets. 

In 2016, for computing its annual effective tax rate, the Company did not benefit from its losses in the states where it files separately. This had no material impact on the Company s income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased the Company s income tax expense by $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Repurchase of common stock relating to the tax withholding of equity award settlements.     

2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

In June 2014, the Company adopted the ESPP in connection with its initial public offering. A total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under this plan. The Company s ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. Under the ESPP, the Company may specify offerings with durations of not more than 27 months, and may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of its common stock will be purchased for employees participating in the offering. An offering may be terminated under certain circumstances. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or on the date of purchase.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has issued 193,849 shares of common stock under the ESPP and 1,806,151 shares of its common stock remain available for issuance.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,    the Company recorded ESPP expense of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively  .    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,    the Company recorded ESPP expense of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively  . 

Share Buyback Program 

On November 6, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a $10.0 million share buyback program, which was completed in December 2015. On November 10, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 million share buyback program. The primary goal of the programs is to offset dilution created by the Company s equity compensation programs.

Purchases are being made through the open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions or other means as determined by the Company s management and in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other conditions. These repurchased shares are accounted for under the cost method and are included as a component of treasury stock in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.   

Pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program, the Company purchased 46,333 and 710,833 shares of its common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, for total consideration of $0.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 

The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 

In March 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, which was approved by the Company s stockholders in May 2015 and is set to expire in March 2025. The 2015 Plan is designed to meet the needs of a publicly traded company, including the requirements for granting  performance based compensation  under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units, performance shares, and other stock or cash awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, members of the Board of Directors and consultants. 

The Company initially reserved 5,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan. This number will be increased by the number of shares available for issuance under the Company s prior equity incentive plans or arrangements that are not subject to options or other awards, plus the number of shares of common stock related to options or other awards granted under the Company s prior equity incentive plans or arrangements that are repurchased, forfeited, expired, or cancelled on or after the effective date of the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan also contains an  evergreen provision  that allows for an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance on January 1 of each year during the 10 year term of the 2015 Plan, beginning January 1, 2016. The annual increase in the number of shares shall be the lesser of (i) 3,000,000 shares, (ii) two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. As of the effective date, there were 5,300,296 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company reserved an aggregate of 3,938,687 shares of common stock for future issuance under the 2015 Plan, including an additional 1,129,962 shares reserved under the 2015 Plan pursuant to the evergreen provision. 

Share-Based Award Activity and Balances 

Stock Options 

The fair value of option awards made to employees and directors is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.

A summary of the status of the Company s nonvested options as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $12.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested stock option based compensation arrangements granted under all plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.3   years and will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.   

Deferred Stock Units/Restricted Stock Units 

Beginning in 2007, the Company granted deferred stock units, or DSUs, to certain employees and members of the Board of Directors with a vesting period of up to five years, and commencing in 2015, such equity was issued as restricted stock units, or RSUs (such RSUs and DSUs are collectively referred to as RSUs). The grantee receives one share of common stock at a specified future date for each RSU awarded. The RSUs may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certificates of common stock have been issued, recorded, and delivered to the participant. The RSUs do not have any voting or dividend rights prior to the issuance of certificates of the underlying common stock. The share-based expense associated with these grants was based on the Company s common stock fair value at the time of grant and is amortized over the requisite service period, which generally is the vesting period, using the straight-line method. The Company recorded a total expense of $1.5 million and $4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for these RSU awards compared to the prior year expense of $1.1 million and $2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  . 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $11.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested RSU-based compensation arrangements granted under all Plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years and will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. 

Information relating to RSU grants and deliveries is as follows:

The total fair market value is derived from the number of RSUs granted times the current stock price on the date of grant.

Equity Awards to Consultants 

The Company has entered into various consulting agreements with its stockholders and third-party consultants. Consulting expenses are accrued as services are rendered. Consulting services are paid in cash and/or in common stock or stock options of the Company. Share-based compensation expense is recorded over the service period based on the estimated fair value of the equity award at the date services are performed or upon completion of all services under the agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an immaterial amount of share-based compensation related to the issuance of equity awards for services rendered by consultants. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $0.1 million, in share-based compensation related to the issuance of equity awards for services rendered by consultants. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in share-based compensation related to the issuance of equity awards for services rendered by consultants. 

The Company recorded share-based compensation expense under all plans and it is included in the Company s consolidated statement of operations as follows: 

15.  Employee Benefits 

401(k) Plan 

The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan, or the Plan, whereby eligible employees voluntarily contribute up to a defined percentage of their annual compensation. The Company matches contributions at a rate of 50% on the first 6% of employee contributions, and pays the administrative costs of the Plan. Employer contributions vest over four years. Total employer contributions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, compared to the prior year expense of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plan 

In connection with the Merck API Transaction, the Company assumed an obligation associated with a defined-benefit plan for eligible employees of AFP. This plan provides benefits to the employees from the date of retirement and is based on the employee s length of time with the Company. The calculation is based on a statistical calculation combining a number of factors that include the employee s age, length of service, and AFPs turnover rate. 

The liability under the plan is based on a discount rate of 1.75% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The liability is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The plan is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under the plan was $1.7 million and $1.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded an immaterial amount of expense under the plan for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

16.  Commitments and Contingencies 

Distribution Agreement with Actavis, Inc. 

In May 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to grant certain exclusive marketing rights for its enoxaparin product to Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Andrx, which generally extends to the U.S. retail pharmacy market. To obtain such rights, Andrx made a non-refundable, upfront payment of $4.5 million to the Company upon execution of the agreement, which was classified as deferred revenues. Under the agreement, the Company is to be paid a fixed cost per unit sold to Andrx and also shares in the gross profits (as defined) from Andrx s sales of the enoxaparin product in the U.S. retail pharmacy market. In November 2006, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Watson, acquired Andrx and all of the rights and obligations associated with the agreement. In January 2013, Watson adopted Actavis, Inc. as its new global name. In March 2015, Actavis acquired Allergan plc and adopted Allergan plc as its new global name in June 2015. 

In January 2012, the Company launched its enoxaparin product, beginning the seven-year period during which Actavis has the exclusive marketing rights for the Company s enoxaparin product in the U.S. retail pharmacy market and the start of the Company s recognition of the $4.5 million deferred revenue over this period on a straight-line basis. Actavis has an option to renew the agreement for an additional three years. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of the deferred revenue was $1.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively. On June 30, 2016, the Company and Actavis agreed to terminate the agreement upon the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies the Company in writing that Actavis has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders. The Company recognizes the remaining balance of the deferred revenue over the period from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, on a straight-line basis as a result of the revised estimate of the contractual period. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of the deferred revenue was $0.8 million. 

The Company manufactures its enoxaparin product for the retail market according to demand specifications of Actavis. Upon shipment of enoxaparin to Actavis, the Company recognizes product sales at an agreed transfer price and records the related cost of products sold. Based on the terms of the Company s distribution agreement with Actavis, the Company is entitled to a share of the ultimate profits based on the eventual net revenue from enoxaparin sales by Actavis to the end user less the agreed transfer price originally paid by Actavis to the Company. Actavis provides the Company with a quarterly sales report that calculates the Company s share of Actavis enoxaparin gross profit. The Company records its share of Actavis gross profit as a component of net revenue. 

Supply Agreement with MannKind Corporation  

On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a supply agreement with MannKind Corporation, or MannKind, or the Supply Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to manufacture for and supply to MannKind certain quantities of RHI for use in MannKind s product, Afrezza     . Under the Supply Agreement, MannKind agreed to purchase annual minimum quantities of RHI in an aggregate amount of approximately  120.1 million, or approximately $146.0 million, over five years from calendar years 2015 through 2019. Specifically, the minimum annual purchase commitment was approximately  27.1 million in 2015, and approximately  23.3 million each year from 2016 through 2019. 

On July 31, 2014, upon entering into the Supply Agreement, MannKind paid a non-refundable prepayment to the Company in the amount of  11.0 million, or approximately $14.0 million. Under the Supply Agreement, the non-refundable prepayment was applied towards the 2015 annual commitment. The Company recorded the amount as deferred revenue in 2014, and it was recognized as net revenue in 2015 at the time the products were shipped.

Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Supply Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, and can be renewed for additional, successive two-year terms upon 12 month s written notice given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two-year term. MannKind and the Company each have customary termination rights, including termination for material breach that is not cured within a specific time frame or in the event of liquidation, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the other party. In addition, MannKind may terminate the Supply Agreement upon two years  prior written notice to the Company without cause or upon 30 days  prior written notice to the Company if a controlling regulatory authority withdraws approval for Afrezza    provided, however, in the event of a termination pursuant to either of these scenarios, the provisions of the supply agreement require MannKind to pay the full amount of all unpaid purchase commitments due over the initial term within 60 calendar days of the effective date of such termination.   

In January 2015, the Company entered into a supply option agreement with MannKind, or the Option Agreement, pursuant to which MannKind has the option to purchase RHI in excess of the minimum amounts specified in the Supply Agreement in calendar years 2016 through 2019. In the event MannKind elects not to exercise its minimum annual purchase option for any year under the Option Agreement, MannKind is obligated to pay the Company a specified capacity cancellation fee. 

In 2015, the sales of RHI to MannKind were  17.1 million, or approximately $20.8 million, and the unfulfilled 2015 commitment under the Supply Agreement was  6.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The Company and MannKind mutually, verbally agreed that MannKind could delay a portion of the minimum contractually obligated quantities of RHI for 2015 and purchase the remaining unfulfilled 2015 commitment in 2016. No other aspects of the Supply Agreement were modified and the commitments for calendar years 2016 through 2019 as specified in the Supply Agreement remain binding and enforceable. 

In October 2015, MannKind informed the Company that it was not exercising the option to purchase additional quantities of RHI for 2016 under the Option Agreement and paid the Company the specified capacity cancellation fee of $0.8 million. Such capacity cancellation fee was recorded as net revenue in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales of RHI to MannKind totaled $6.8 million, which fulfilled the remaining unfulfilled 2015 commitment of RHI under the Supply Agreement. MannKind had no unfulfilled purchase obligations under the Supply Agreement as of September 30, 2016, although it has not yet purchased any of its 2016 minimum purchase commitment.  

The Company is currently in discussions with MannKind regarding the timing of fulfillment of its minimum purchase commitment of RHI under the Supply Agreement and its purchase of additional quantities under the Option Agreement. The Company anticipates that these discussions may result in reductions in the capacity cancellation fees, as well as extensions of the timing of MannKind's purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement. 

Collaboration Agreement with a Medical Device Manufacturer 

The Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by the Company for one of its pipeline products. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and $0.7 million in milestone payments under this agreement, which were classified as research and development expense. The Company is obligated to pay up to an additional $1.3 million if certain milestones are met. As of September 30, 2016, no such obligation existed. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and the Company s pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, the Company is obligated to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer for a minimum purchase of 1.0 million units during the first 12 months.

Operating Lease Agreements 

The Company leases real and personal property, in the ordinary course of business, under various non-cancelable operating leases. The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of its leases, at the market rate, for various renewal periods ranging from one to six years. Rental expense under these leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $0.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, compared to $0.8 million and $2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.   

Purchase Commitments 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has entered into commitments to purchase equipment and raw materials for an aggregate of $17.9 million. The Company anticipates that most of these commitments will be fulfilled by 2017.   

The Company entered into agreements with a Chinese governmental entity to acquire land-use rights to real property in Nanjing, China. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company committed to invest capital in its wholly-owned subsidiary, ANP, and to develop these properties as an API manufacturing facility for the Company s pipeline products. In conjunction with these agreements, ANP modified its business license on July 3, 2012 to increase its authorized capital. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had invested approximately $49.0 million in ANP out of its registered capital commitment of $61.0 million. The Company has committed to invest the remaining $12.0 million in ANP by December 2017. This investment in ANP will result in cash transfers from the U.S. parent company to ANP.  

Per these agreements, in January 2010, the Company acquired certain land-use rights with a carrying value of $1.2 million. In addition, the Company purchased additional land-use rights in November 2012 for $1.3 million. The Company committed to spend approximately $15.0 million in land development. The agreements require the construction of fixed assets on the property and specified a timetable for the construction of these fixed assets. The current pace of development of the property is behind the schedules described in the purchase agreements and, per the purchase agreement, potential monetary penalties could result if the development is delayed or not completed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the purchase agreements. The Company is in discussions with the Chinese government regarding the development and believes that the likelihood of incurring any penalty is remote. 

17.  Litigation 

Enoxaparin Patent Litigation 

In September 2011, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Momenta, a Boston based pharmaceutical company, and Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, the generic division of Novartis, initiated litigation against the Company for alleged patent infringement of two patents related to testing methods for batch release of enoxaparin, which the Company refers to as the   886 patent  and the   466 patent.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or the Massachusetts District Court. In October 2011, the Massachusetts District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring the Company from selling its generic enoxaparin product and also requiring Momenta and Sandoz to post a $100.1 million bond. The preliminary injunction was stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the Federal Circuit, in January 2012, and reversed by the Federal Circuit in August 2012. 

In January 2013, the Company moved for summary judgment of non infringement of both patents. Momenta and Sandoz withdrew their allegations as to the  466 patent, and in July 2013, the Massachusetts District Court granted the Company s motion for summary judgment of non infringement of the  886 patent and denied Momenta and Sandoz s motion for leave to amend their infringement contentions. On January 24, 2014, the Massachusetts District Court judge entered final judgment in the Company s favor on both patents. Momenta and Sandoz also filed a motion to collect attorneys  fees and costs relating to a discovery motion which the Massachusetts District Court granted. On May 9, 2016, the Massachusetts District Court issued an order imposing fees and costs of approximately $0.4 million in relation to this discovery motion.

This amount has been accrued in the general and administrative expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2016  .    On January 30, 2014, Momenta and Sandoz filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit appealing the court s final judgment including summary judgment denying Momenta and Sandoz s motion for leave to amend their infringement contentions.  

Following appeal briefing filed by the parties, t  he Federal Circuit held oral argument on May 4, 2015. On November 10, 2015, the Federal Circuit panel affirmed-in-part and vacated-in-part the decision of the   Massachusetts   District Court granting summary judgment of non-infringement as to the Company, and it remanded the case to the   Massachusetts   District Court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The Federal Circuit panel affirmed the   Massachusetts   District Court s holding in the Company s favor that the Company does not infringe under 35 U.S.C. 271(g), and the panel vacated the grant of summary judgment to the extent it was based on the determination that the Company s activities fall within the 35 U.S.C. 271(e)(1) safe harbor.  The Federal Circuit panel also left to the   Massachusetts   District Court s discretion whether to reconsider on remand its denial of leave for Momenta and Sandoz to amend their infringement contentions. On January 11, 2016, the Company filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc with the Federal Circuit. On February 17, 2016, the Federal Circuit denied the Company s Petition, and the Federal Circuit issued its mandate on February 24, 2016, whereby the case returned to the   Massachusetts   District Court for further proceedings.   

On March 18, 2016, the parties filed a joint status report with the Massachusetts District Court. On June 21, 2016, the Massachusetts District Court granted Momenta and Sandoz s Motion for Leave to Amend its Infringement Contentions. In light of Momenta and Sandoz s Amended Infringement Contentions and recent changes in Supreme Court precedent since the case was stayed in 2012, the Company sought to amend its Non-Infringement and Invalidity Contentions. The Massachusetts District Court then held a status conference on July 6, 2016 and referred the issue of the Company s amended contentions to the Magistrate Judge for briefing and further informed the parties that replies to any Summary Judgment motion are due in May 2017 and that trial is set to begin on July 10, 2017. On July 15, 2016, the Massachusetts District Court entered the Amended Scheduling Order setting the end of any remaining fact discovery for November 22, 2016 and the end of expert discovery for March 24, 2017.  

On July 18, 2016, the Company submitted its Motion for Leave to Amend Its Non-Infringement and Invalidity Contentions and Momenta and Sandoz responded on July 25, 2016. In light of the new arguments made in their response, the Company further filed a Motion For Leave to Reply in Further Support of Defendants  Motion for Leave to Amend Non-Infringement and Invalidity Contentions. The Massachusetts District Court has not yet ruled on the Company s pending motions regarding its amended contentions.  

In parallel with the Massachusetts District Court proceedings, the Company appealed the Federal Circuit s decision to vacate the grant of the Company s summary judgment to the extent it was based on the determination that the Company s activities are protected under the Safe Harbor. The Company filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court on May 17, 2016. Momenta and Sandoz initially waived their right to respond to the petition; however, on May 31, 2016, the Supreme Court requested a response from Momenta and Sandoz. The response from Momenta and Sandoz was initially due on June 30, 2016, but they requested an extension. Momenta and Sandoz filed their response on August 1, 2016. On October 3, 2016, the Supreme Court declined the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. 

The Company will continue to vigorously defend this case in the Massachusetts District   Court. The Company intends to attempt to collect the $100.1 million bond posted by Momenta and Sandoz following a decision on the merits, provided that the Company prevails in   Massachusetts   District Court. 

False Claims Act Litigation 

In January 2009, the Company filed a qui tam complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, or the California District Court, alleging that Aventis Pharma S.A., or Aventis, through its acquisition of a patent through false and misleading statements to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as through false and misleading statements to the FDA, overcharged the federal and state governments for its Lovenox      product. If the Company is

successful in this litigation, it could be entitled to a portion of any damage award that the government ultimately may recover from Aventis. In October 2011, the California District Court unsealed the Company s complaint.  

On February 28, 2014, Aventis filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the adequacy of the Company s notice letter to the government, and the California District Court denied Aventis  motion for summary judgment in a final order it issued on May 12, 2014. On June 9, 2014, at Aventis  request, the California District Court issued an order certifying for appeal its order denying Aventis  motion for summary judgment. On June 9, 2014, Aventis filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or the Ninth Circuit, a petition for permission to appeal the California District Court s denial of Aventis  motion for summary judgment, and the Company filed an opposition to Aventis  petition on June 19, 2014. On August 22, 2014, the Ninth Circuit granted Aventis  petition. The parties have completed and filed their respective appeal briefs with the Ninth Circuit. A date for oral argument has not been set by the Ninth Circuit. 

The California District Court set an evidentiary hearing for July 7, 2014 on the  original source  issue, a key element under the False Claims Act. The evidentiary hearing was conducted as scheduled, from July 7, 2014 through July 10, 2014. On July 13, 2015, the California District Court issued a ruling concluding that the Company is not an original source under the False Claims Act and entered final judgment dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  

On July 20, 2015, the Company filed with the Ninth Circuit a notice of appeal of the California District Court s dismissal of the case, and Aventis filed a notice of cross-appeal on August 5, 2015. On November 12, 2015, Aventis filed a pleading asking that the California District Court impose various monetary penalties and fines against the Company, including disgorgement of enoxaparin revenues and attorneys  fees expended by Aventis in this action, based on Aventis s allegations that the Company engaged in sanctionable conduct. On November 23, 2015, the California District Court issued an order setting forth a procedure for sanctions proceedings as to the Company as well as its outside counsel. On December 24, 2015, the Company filed a pleading with the California District Court opposing the imposition of sanctions and on January 20, 2016, Aventis filed a response pleading further pressing for the imposition of sanctions. On May 4, 2016, the California District Court issued three orders requesting that the Company and its outside counsel file a document showing cause as to why sanctions should not be imposed and to set up a conference call with the partiers and the court to discuss whether any discovery and/or a hearing is necessary. On June 13, 2016, the Company and its outside counsel each filed responses to the court s order to show cause as to why sanctions should not be imposed. On July 21, 2016, Aventis filed a response contending that the court should impose sanctions. The   Company intends to continue to   vigorously defend against any such imposition of sanctions.  

On March 28, 2016, the Company filed its opening brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals setting forth detailed arguments as to why the False Claims Act litigation should not have been dismissed by the California District Court. On June 20, 2016, Aventis filed its principal brief in the appeal, responding to the Company s arguments regarding dismissal of the False Claims Act litigation, and setting forth Aventis s argument that it should be awarded attorneys  fees and expenses. On September 19, 2016, the Company filed its reply brief to Aventis s principal brief. On October 3, 2016, Aventis filed its reply brief in support of its cross-appeal of the District Court s denial of attorneys  fees.  The Ninth Circuit has scheduled oral arguments to be heard on November 10, 2016. 

California Employment Litigation 

On January 6, 2015, the Company received a formal demand from Plaintiff s counsel in an employment related lawsuit captioned Eva Hernandez v. International Medication Systems Limited, in connection with a complaint originally filed on February 4, 2013 in the Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles, or the Court, by plaintiff Eva Hernandez on behalf of herself and others similarly situated. Plaintiff s complaint included alleged violations of the California Labor Code stemming from the Company s alleged timekeeping practices, as well as other similar and related claims brought under California law. In the complaint, Plaintiff sought damages and related remedies under California law, as well as various penalty payments under the California Labor Code, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated. On April 7,

2015, solely to resolve the dispute, minimize disruption to the Company due to ongoing litigation, and other similar and related factors (but unrelated to the alleged merits of Plaintiff s claims), the Company reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter on a class-wide basis for a total amount of $3.2 million, plus applicable payroll taxes.   The Joint Stipulation of Settlement as executed by the parties was filed with the Court on June 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement, and on November 5, 2015, the Court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement. 

Momenta/Sandoz Antitrust Litigation 

On September 17, 2015, the Company initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint in the California District Court against Momenta and Sandoz, or Defendants. The Company s complaint generally asserts that Defendants have engaged in certain types of illegal, monopolistic, and anticompetitive conduct giving rise to various causes of action against them. On December 9, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to transfer the case to the District of Massachusetts. On January 4, 2016, the Company filed oppositions to both motions. On January 26, 2016, the California District Court granted Defendants  motion to transfer and did not rule on Defendants  motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the case was transferred to the District of Massachusetts. On February 9, 2016, the Company filed a writ of mandamus with the Ninth Circuit to attempt to appeal the California District Court s granting of Defendants  motion to transfer to the District of Massachusetts. The Ninth Circuit denied this petition on May 20, 2016, and as such the case will remain before the District of Massachusetts. On July 27, 2016, the Massachusetts District Court granted Defendants  motion to dismiss based upon an antitrust immunity doctrine, without addressing the substantive merits of the claims.   

On August 25, 2016, the Company filed with the First Circuit Court of Appeals a notice of appeal of the Massachusetts District Court s dismissal of the antitrust case.   On October 31, 2016, the Company filed   its appeal   brief with the   First Circuit. Defendants  opposition brief is due December 5, 2016 and the Company s reply brief is due December 22, 2016.  

Other Litigation 

The Company is also subject to various other claims and lawsuits from time-to-time arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of any such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and the Company s view of these matters may change in the future. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 

18.        Subsequent Events 

On November 7, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an increase of $20.0 million to the Company s share buyback program, which is expected to continue for an indefinite period of time. The primary goal of the program is to offset dilution created by the Company s equity compensation programs. 

Purchases may be made through the open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions or other means as determined by the Company s management and in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. 

The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other conditions.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION   AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to our management, and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, those identified under the  Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements,  above and described in greater detail elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, particularly in Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

Overview 

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., together with our wholly-owned subsidiaries, International Medication Systems, Limited, or IMS; Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Armstrong; Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or ANP; Nanjing Letop Fine Chemistry Co., Ltd., or Letop; Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals, S.A.S., or AFP; Amphastar UK Ltd., or AUK; and International Medication Systems (UK) Limited, or IMS UK, is a specialty pharmaceutical company that   focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling technically-challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation and intranasal products. Additionally, we sell insulin active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API products. We currently manufacture and sell 19 products including Amphadase     , which we re-launched in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Additionally, we are developing a portfolio of 15 generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, three generic biosimilar and six proprietary injectable and inhalation product candidates. 

Our largest product by net revenues is currently enoxaparin sodium injection, the generic equivalent of Sanofi S.A. s Lovenox     . Enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant and is indicated for multiple indications, including the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis. 

We have agreements with established group purchasing organizations and wholesaler networks to distribute enoxaparin, which is marketed under our own label for the hospital and clinic market. For the U.S. retail market, we have an agreement with Actavis Inc., or Actavis, to distribute enoxaparin, which is marketed under Actavis  label. On June 30, 2016, Actavis and Amphastar agreed to terminate the agreement upon the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies us in writing that Actavis has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders.   

In June 2015, we received approval of our new drug application, or NDA supplement for Amphadase     . This marks the first approved starting material from ANP and signifies that our facility located in Nanjing, China has been qualified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We re-launched Amphadase      in the fourth quarter of 2015. Amphadase      is competing in the hyaluronidase market and is used for the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs.  

Our pipeline of over 20 generic and proprietary product candidates is in various stages of development and targets a variety of indications. With respect to these product candidates, we have four   abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, and two NDAs on file with the FDA. 

To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. These acquisitions collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing, and research and development capabilities including the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products. 

-  36  - 

Table of Contents  

Included in these acquisitions are 14 ANDAs representing 11 different injectable chemical entities from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC in March 2016, and marketing authorizations for 33 products in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, representing 11 different injectable chemical entities, from UCB Pharma GmbH. We plan to transfer these products to our facilities in California, which will require approvals from the FDA, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or other related regulatory agencies before the product candidates can be launched or re-launched by us. 

Business Segments 

Our performance is assessed and resources will be allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) API products. The finished pharmaceutical products segment currently manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, Cortrosyn     , Amphadase     , naloxone, lidocaine jelly, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment currently manufactures and distributes recombinant human insulin, or RHI, and porcine insulin. Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products. 

For more information regarding our segments, see  Part I   Item 1. Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Segment Reporting.  

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net revenues 

Net revenues were $64.2 million and $63.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $0.3 million. Sales of phytonadione increased to $8.7 million from $5.9 million, as a result of an increase in average selling price.  Sales of lidocaine increased to $8.3 million from $6.2 million, representing an increase of $2.1 million, of which $1.6 million was due to an increase in unit volume and $0.5 million was due to an increase in average selling price. Sales of naloxone increased to $12.4 million from $10.5 million, primarily as a result of an increase in unit volumes, which were partially offset by increased rebates of $0.9 million. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of enoxaparin by $5.9 million to $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2016 from $21.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 due to lower unit volumes in the retail market, as a result of the termination agreement with Actavis. We completed shipments to Actavis under our supply agreement in August 2016. Additionally, our insulin API business had an overall decrease in sales of RHI and porcine insulin to $5.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2015, as MannKind purchased the remaining

Table of Contents  

unfulfilled 2015 commitments during the third quarter of 2016, but has not purchased any of its 2016 commitments under the supply agreement entered into in 2014, or the Supply Agreement. 

We expect that the average selling price and unit volumes of enoxaparin will decline in the near term as a result of increased competition. In addition, the timing of sales into the retail channel may be adversely affected in the near term, as we stopped shipping to Actavis in the third quarter, and we cannot sell directly into the retail market directly until the contract termination date which is the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies us in writing that it has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders. We believe that pricing increases on several other finished pharmaceutical products will partially offset lower enoxaparin sales; however, we expect that net revenues for the remainder of 2016 may be negatively impacted. Net revenues would also be impacted if sales of our products were affected by any manufacturing or production issues, supply chain interruptions or unexpected regulatory issues. 

We anticipate that sales of insulin API will continue to fluctuate and decrease due to the inherent uncertainties related to sales of RHI to MannKind. We are currently in discussion with MannKind regarding its purchases of the 2016 minimum purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement and the 2017 minimum quantities under the supply option agreement entered into in 2015, or the Option Agreement.   We anticipate that these discussions may result in reductions in the capacity cancellation fees, as well as extensions of the timing of MannKind's purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement.   In addition, most of our API sales are denominated in Euros, and the fluctuation in the value of the Euro versus the dollar compared to 2015 has had, and will continue to have, an impact on API sales revenues in the near term. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues were $36.6 million and $46.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $9.7 million. Cost of revenue of enoxaparin decreased by $6.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in average cost per unit of $1.8 million as a result of lower heparin input costs and a decrease in unit volume of $4.9 million. In addition, there was an increase in manufacturing volumes in the third quarter of 2016, which increased overhead absorption. This benefit was partially offset by increased personnel costs at our U.S. manufacturing sites. 

Declining prices and unit volume of enoxaparin will put downward pressure on gross margins, but we believe this trend will be partially offset by increases in prices of several other finished pharmaceutical products. As a result, gross margin is expected to be variable depending on revenue mix. 

Selling, distribution and marketing, general and administrative, and impairment of long-lived assets 

Selling, distribution, and marketing expenses were $1.3 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses were $10.8 million and $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $1.8 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel cost and legal fees.   

We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an annual basis due to increased costs associated with ongoing compliance with public company reporting obligations as well as legal fees associated with our enoxaparin patent litigation..

Table of Contents  

Research and development 

Research and development expenses were $9.7 million and $11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trials expense.  

Research and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, such as salaries and other personnel related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, manufacturing pre launch inventory, clinical trials, FDA fees, testing, operating and lab supplies, depreciation and other related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 

We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in research and development to expand our product portfolio and grow our business. These costs will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of various clinical trials, the pre-launch costs associated with new products, and FDA filing fees. As we undertake new and challenging research and development projects, we anticipate that the associated annual costs will increase significantly over the next several quarters and years. 

The following table sets forth our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Provision for income tax expense (benefit) 

Provision for income tax expense was $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase in income tax expense of $3.4 million.  The increase in income tax expense is related to a pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2016 compared to a pre-tax loss during the third quarter of 2015.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Net revenues 

Net revenues were $191.6 million and $174.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $17.0 million. Sales of naloxone increased to $38.2 million from $27.9 million, primarily as a result of an increase in unit volumes, but were offset by lower pricing in the form of increased rebates of $2.2 million. Sales of phytonadione increased to $23.6 million from $10.3 million, due to an increase in average selling price. Sales of lidocaine increased to $26.4 million from $20.7 million, representing an increase of $5.7 million, of which, $4.1 million was due to an increase in average selling price and $1.6 million was due to an increase in unit volumes. Sales of epinephrine increased to $14.9 million from $10.0 million, primarily due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by a decrease in unit volumes of $1.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of enoxaparin to $51.0 million from $64.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $13.6 million, of which $7.1 million was due to lower average selling price and $6.5 million was due to lower unit volumes, as a result of the termination of the agreement with Actavis.  Additionally, sales of RHI and porcine insulin within our insulin API business decreased to $10.3 million from $15.8 million primarily because MannKind had only fulfilled its 2015 commitments under the Supply Agreement as of September 30, 2016, and has not purchased any of its 2016 commitments under the Supply Agreement. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues was $107.4 million and $130.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $23.0 million. Cost of revenues of enoxaparin decreased by $11.7 million,  primarily due to a decrease in average cost per unit of $6.1 million as a result of lower heparin input costs and a decrease in unit volumes of $5.6 million. Cost of revenue of RHI and porcine insulin decreased by $4.0 million primarily due to a decrease in unit volumes sold. In addition, there was an increase in manufacturing volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which increased overhead absorption by $6.1 million. This benefit was partially offset by increased personnel costs at our U.S. manufacturing sites.

Selling, distribution and marketing, general and administrative, and impairment of long-lived assets 

Selling, distribution, and marketing expenses were $4.0 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses were $31.1 million and $32.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.3 million settlement in 2015 relating to our California employment litigation, which was partially offset by a decrease in our consulting fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These decrease were partially offset by an increase in personnel cost and legal fees. 

Research and development 

Research and development expenses were $28.6 million and $28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of $0.2 million, primarily due to an increase in FDA fees pertaining to the filing of the NDA for our intranasal naloxone product candidate, and was partially offset by a decrease in clinical trials expense.  

Research and development costs consist primarily of costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates, such as salaries and other personnel related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, manufacturing pre launch inventory, clinical trials, FDA fees, testing, operating and lab supplies, depreciation and other related expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred.

Provision for income tax expense (benefit) 

Provision for income tax expense was $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase in income tax expense of $16.7 million.  The increase in income tax expense is related to a pre-tax income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a pre-tax loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, in 2015 there was a reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance which had previously been reserved that contributed to the income tax benefit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Requirements and Sources 

We need capital resources to maintain and expand our business.   We expect our cash requirements to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we sponsor clinical trials for, seek regulatory approvals of, and develop, manufacture and market our current development stage product candidates and pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses or assets.   Our future capital expenditures include projects to upgrade, expand and improve our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and France. Our cash obligations include the principal and interest payments due on our existing loans and lease payments, as described below and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that our cash reserves, operating cash flows, and borrowings availability under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months.   We expect additional cash flows to be generated in the longer term from future product introductions, although there can be no assurance as to the receipt of regulatory approval for any product candidates or the timing of any product introductions, which could be lengthy or ultimately unsuccessful. 

We maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $250.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units, or debt securities.   If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Working capital increased by $13.3 million to $129.3 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $116.0 million at December 31, 2015.

Cash Flows from Operations 

The following table summarizes our cash flows used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Sources and Use of Cash 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included net income of $13.3 million. Non-cash items were comprised of $10.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $11.6 million of share-based compensation expense, and a $3.2 million change in tax related items. This was partially offset by a change of $15.3 million in operating assets and liabilities which was primarily due to the decrease of accounts receivable and an increase in inventory. 

Accounts receivable declined by approximately $6.8 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease of sales of $12.7 million to $64.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.   

Inventories increased by approximately $19.5 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015. Enoxaparin related inventory increased $9.9 million as a result of the timing of component and raw material purchases. Inventory relating to other finished pharmaceutical products increased by $8.4 million due to higher forecasted future demands, and RHI and porcine insulin inventory increased by $1.2 million in the API segment due to the timing of sales deliveries.    

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was $32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of $7.7 million for the purchase of IMS UK, $4.0 million for the purchase of the 14 ANDAs from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC, $0.8 million relating to the acquisition of Nanjing Letop Medical Technology Co. Ltd., or Letop, and $16.0 million in purchases of property, machinery, and equipment, including the associated capitalized labor and interest on self-constructed assets. Additionally, $2.9 million in deposits were made for machinery and equipment in 2016. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This cash inflow is a result of $18.5 million of proceeds received from stock options exercises related to our equity plans and purchases of our common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was offset by payments of $10.3 million relating to the repurchase of our common stock.  Additionally, we refinanced two existing mortgages which led to the receipts of $10.2 million, and these inflows were offset by $10.0 million of principal repayments, primarily related to these mortgage loans.

Indebtedness 

For more information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see  Part I   Item 1. Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Debt.  

Contractual Obligations 

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except that o  ur outstanding debt obligations have changed as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $37.1 million in unused borrowing capacity under revolving lines of credit with Cathay Bank and East West Bank. 

We have entered into a collaboration agreement with a medical device manufacturer to develop a drug delivery system to be used by us for one of our pipeline products. As of September 30, 2016, we have paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and $0.7 million in milestone payments under this agreement, which were classified as research and development expense. We are obligated to pay up to an additional $1.3 million if certain milestones are met. As of September 30, 2016, no such obligation existed. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, if the medical device manufacturer is successful in the development of this drug delivery system and our pipeline products receive appropriate regulatory approval, we are obligated to enter into a commercial supply agreement with such medical device manufacturer for a minimum purchase of 1.0 million units during the first 12 months. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.  

For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies  section of our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. In addition,   for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  in Note 2 in the accompanying  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  in this Quarterly Report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

Government Regulation 

Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of U.S. federal and state governmental agencies as well as foreign regulatory agencies. The FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of the majority of our products. The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances. 

From January 19, 2015 through January 22, 2015, our facility in  ragny-Sur-Epte, France was subject to an inspection by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (Agence nationale de s curit  du m dicament et des produits de sant ), or ANSM. The inspection included a review of current EU Good Manufacturing Practices, or EU-GMP for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use (EU-GMP Part II for Active Substances) and Manufacture of Biological Active Substances and Medicinal Products for Human Use (EU-GMP Annex 2). The inspections resulted in various observations issued formally to the facility. We responded to those observations on March 13, 2015, with a minor follow up response on April 3, 2015. We received acknowledgment from ANSM that our responses to the observations were satisfactorily addressed and our facility was issued a certificate of EU-GMP compliance from the Agency dated April 9, 2015, that is valid until January 2018. 

From July 22, 2015 through August 10, 2015, our IMS facility in South El Monte, California was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our compliance with cGMP regulations and preapproval inspections for ANDAs currently being reviewed by the FDA. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483, an FDA form on which deficiencies are noted after an FDA inspection. We responded to those observations on August 31, 2015.     We believe that our responses to the Form 483 will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary. 

From February 29, 2016 through March 4, 2016, our facility in  ragny-sur-Epte, France was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on March 24, 2016. We believe that our response to the Form 483 will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no further actions will be necessary. 

From April 25, 2016 through April 28, 2016, our facility in Nanjing, China was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection resulted in no observations on Form 483. 

From August 22, 2016 through August 26, 2016, our facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California, was subject to an inspection of the bioanalytical data and operations for the conduct of the bioequivalence studies conducted by us. The inspection resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on September 16, 2016. We believe that our response to the Form 483 will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and that no further actions will be necessary. 

From October 6, 2016 through October 14, 2016, our third party contract clinical study site was subject to a biomedical inspection by the FDA covering pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical studies, executed per our in-house designed protocols.   There were no Form 483 observations issued at the end of the inspection.  

From October 17, 2016 through October 21, 2016, our facility in Chino, California, was subject to inspection of the facility s compliance with Good Laboratory Practices regulations, and associated operations for the conduct of the non-clinical safety/toxicity studies conducted by us. The inspection resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We plan to respond to those observations by November 11, 2016, in accordance with FDA requirements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE   DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The following discussion provides forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of our investments (Investment Risk), the impact of interest rate changes (Interest Rate Risk), and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk). 

Investment Risk 

We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and recognize losses for income statement purposes when events and circumstances indicate that any declines in the fair values of such investments below our accounting basis are other than temporary. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any such investments. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $  3.3 million   deposited in four banks located in China, $2.1 million deposited in one bank located in France, and $0.2 million deposited in one bank located in the United Kingdom. We also maintained $44.7 million in cash equivalents that include money market accounts, money market funds,   Money Market Insured Deposit Account Service, or MMIDAS, and Insured Cash Sweep, or ICS,   accounts as of September 30, 2016. The remaining amounts of our cash equivalent as of September 30, 2016, are in non-interest bearing accounts. 

The MMIDAS accounts and ICS accounts allow us to distribute our funds among a network of depository institutions that are re allocated such that each deposit account is below the $250.0 thousand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, limit, thus providing greater FDIC insurance coverage for our overall cash balances. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts, nor do we believe that we are exposed to any significant credit risk on our bank account balances.  

Interest Rate Risk 

Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitive investments and credit facilities, which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the nature of our short-term investments, we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk with respect to our short-term investments. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $42.7 million in long-term debt and capital leases outstanding. Of this amount, $21.2 million had variable interest rates with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.9% at September 30, 2016. An increase in the index underlying these rates of 1% (100 basis points) would increase our annual interest expense on the variable-rate debt by approximately $0.2  million per year.   

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

Our products are primarily sold in the U.S. domestic market, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign sales were minimal. Therefore, we have little exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, as a result of our acquisition of the API manufacturing business in  ragny-sur-Epte, France, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Specifically, our insulin sales contracts are primarily denominated in Euros, which are subject to fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, or USD. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. At this time, an immediate 10% change in currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Our Chinese subsidiary, Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals, Limited, or ANP, maintains its books of record in Chinese Yuan. These books are remeasured into the functional currency of USD, using the current or historical exchange rates. The resulting currency remeasurement adjustments and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in our statement of operations.

Table of Contents  

Our French subsidiary, Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals, S.A.S., or AFP, maintains its books of record in Euros. Our U.K. subsidiary, International Medication Systems (UK) Limited, or IMS UK, maintains its book of record in Great Britain Pounds. These books are translated to USD at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Equity is translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the date of the equity transactions. Translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders  equity and are included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). We do not undertake hedging transactions to cover our foreign currency exposure. 

As of September 30, 2016, our foreign subsidiaries had receivables denominated in foreign currencies in the amount of $2.7 million.   

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE  S   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable level of assurance due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed below (a) to ensure that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the area of non-standard and complex transactions. The accounting for certain non-standard and complex transactions were not analyzed and/or reviewed in sufficient detail by knowledgeable personnel to reach the appropriate accounting conclusion to properly record the transaction. The number of errors identified and the commonality of the root cause of the adjustments (namely, inadequate resources to provide for a more thorough and precise review in these areas), leads us to conclude that there is a material weakness in our internal controls. Recognizing this material weakness and the resulting errors identified, management performed additional analyses and supplementary review procedures and has concluded that the effects of these errors were not material to any prior year or prior quarters  previously reported amounts. Despite the existence of this material weakness, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.  

We are currently in process of remediating the material weakness described above.   The remediation efforts are   focused on addressing the underlying causes of the material weakness and include hiring additional accounting and finance personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience, enhancing and segregating duties within our accounting and finance department, and enhancing our internal review procedures during the financial closing process. We believe these additional resources, processes and procedures will enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our controls relating to the oversight and review of financial statements and our application of relevant accounting policies. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except for the remediation efforts described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting   (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and   

-  47  - 

Table of Contents  

15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), other than the remediation efforts as discussed above. Internal control over financial reporting means a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls  

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management overriding the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATIO  N 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

For information regarding legal proceedings, refer to Litigation in Note 17 in the accompanying  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  in this Quarterly Report. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTOR  S 

Except as noted below, there were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.  

Jack Yongfeng Zhang and Mary Ziping Luo have pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain borrowed funds. The forced sale of these shares pursuant to a margin call could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business.  

Since September 30, 2015,   UBS Bank USA, has made extensions of credit in the aggregate amount of $4.8 million to Applied Physics   Chemistry Laboratories, Inc., which is owned solely by Jack Yongfeng Zhang and Mary Ziping Luo. The loan is pledged by 1,907,898 shares of our common stock currently held by Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo.   Interest on the loan accrues at market rates.   UBS Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans.    

We are not a party to these loans, which are full recourse against Applied Physics   Chemistry Laboratories, Inc. and are secured by pledges of a portion of our common stock currently beneficially owned by Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo.  

If the price of our common stock declines, Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo may be forced by UBS Bank USA to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of our common stock held by them in order   to remain within the margin limitations     imposed under the terms of their loans. The loans between these banking institutions on the one hand, and Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo on the other hand, prohibit the non-pledged shares currently owned by Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo from being pledged to secure any other loans. These factors may limit Dr. Zhang and Dr. Luo s ability to either pledge additional shares of our common stock or sell shares of our common stock held by them as a means to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to their pledged common stock in the event of a decline in our stock price that is large enough to trigger a margin call. Any sales of common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied may cause the price of our common   stock to decline further. 

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry 

Our enoxaparin product represents a significant portion of our net revenues. If the sales volume or pricing of this product continues to decline, or if we are unable to satisfy market demand for this product, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.  

Sales from our enoxaparin product, which is our largest selling product, represented 34%, 51%, and 64% of our total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We are currently experiencing declining revenue from enoxaparin and some of our other existing products and we may operate at a loss in the near term while continuing to invest in developing new products. If the sales volume or pricing of enoxaparin continues to decline, or if we are unable to satisfy market demand for this product, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline. For example, due to intense pricing competition in the pharmaceutical industry, we have experienced significant declines in the per unit pricing and gross margins attributable to our enoxaparin product since its commercial launch. Our enoxaparin product could be rendered obsolete or negatively impacted by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

decreasing average sales prices;      

development by others of new pharmaceutical products that are more effective than ours;      

-  49  - 

Table of Contents  

entrance of new competitors into our markets;      

loss of key relationships with suppliers, group purchasing organizations or end-user customers;      

manufacturing or supply interruptions;      

changes in the prescribing practices of physicians;      

changes in third-party reimbursement practices;      

product liability claims; and      

product recalls or safety alerts.      

Any factor adversely affecting the sale of enoxaparin may cause our revenues to decline, and we may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, on June 30, 2016, we and Actavis agreed to terminate the agreement upon the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies us in writing that Actavis has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders. If we are unable to engage another marketing and distribution partner, or if we are unable to market and distribute our enoxaparin product ourselves, revenues could be delayed from this product, and our profitability would be adversely affected. 

If our business partners do not fulfill their obligations with respect to our distribution or collaboration agreements, our revenues and our business will suffer.  

Pursuant to certain distribution or collaboration agreements, the success of some of our products or product candidates also depends on the success of the collaboration with our business partners, who are responsible for certain aspects of researching, developing, marketing, distributing or commercializing our products or product candidates. If any such agreement were to be terminated in accordance with its terms, including due to a party s failure to perform its obligations or responsibilities under the agreement, revenues could be delayed or diminished from these products and our revenues and/or profit share for these products could be adversely impacted.  

For example, we have a profit sharing agreement with Actavis to market and distribute our enoxaparin product to the retail market in the United States. On June 30, 2016, we and Actavis agreed to terminate the agreement upon the earlier of (i) January 1, 2017, and (ii) such earlier date that is 30 days after Actavis notifies us in writing that Actavis has less than 30 days inventory of the enoxaparin product remaining in its possession or scheduled to be delivered pursuant to the pending purchase orders. If we are unable to engage another marketing and distribution partner, or if we are unable to market and distribute our enoxaparin product ourselves, revenues could be delayed from this product, and our profitability would be adversely affected. 

Underutilization of our manufacturing capacity could negatively impact our gross margins.    

We have invested significantly in our manufacturing capacity in order to vertically integrate our business, contain the costs of raw materials and reduce the risks imposed by relying on third-party single source suppliers. We currently own and operate facilities that manufacture raw materials and APIs for our products and product candidates and those of our customers and partners, including insulin API for MannKind. However, if market demand decreases or if market supply surpasses demand, whether because of macroeconomic factors, pharmaceutical industry volatility, or deficiencies specific to our customers, we may not be able to reduce manufacturing expenses or overhead costs proportionately. For example, a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in our facility in  ragny-sur-Epte, France is utilized for the manufacture of insulin API for MannKind, and a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity in Rancho Cucamonga is utilized for the manufacture of enoxaparin. We anticipate that sales of insulin API for MannKind will decrease. We are currently in discussion with MannKind regarding its purchases of the 2016 minimum purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement and the 2017 minimum quantities under the Option Agreement and anticipate that these discussions will result in reductions in the capacity cancellation fees, as well as extensions of the timing of MannKind s purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement.  If an increase in supply outpaces the increase in

Table of Contents  

market demand, or if demand decreases, such as a reduction in sales of insulin API for MannKind, the resulting oversupply could adversely impact our sales and result in the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, high inventory levels, changes in revenue mix and rapid price erosion, which would lower our margins and adversely impact our financial results.  

The United Kingdom s vote to leave the European Union will have uncertain effects and could adversely affect us.  

On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held on the UK s membership in the European Union, or the EU, the outcome of which was a vote in favor of leaving the EU  , or the Brexit. Negotiations are expected to commence shortly to determine the future terms of the UK s relationship with the EU, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU and the rest of the world.  

Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, or Article 50, allows a member state to decide to withdraw from the European Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. The formal process for leaving the European Union will be triggered only when the United Kingdom delivers an Article 50 notice to the European Council, although informal negotiations around the terms of any exit may be held before such notice is given. The UK Prime Minister has stated that the UK will deliver an Article 50 notice by the end of March 2017.  Following the ruling of the UK High Court on November 3, 2016, that the UK Parliament must vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the European Union, it is unclear whether it will be possible for the UK Government to stick to this timeline, although the Prime Minister has indicated that it remains her intention to do so.  The UK Government is appealing the ruling of the High Court to the UK Supreme Court, which appeal is due to be heard in December 2016. 

Delivery of the Article 50 notice will start a two-year period for the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union, although this period can be extended with the unanimous agreement of the European Council. Without any such extension (and assuming that the terms of withdrawal have not already been agreed), the United Kingdom s membership in the European Union would end automatically on the expiration of that two-year period. 

The effects of Brexit will depend on agreements the UK makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit   creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the UK and potentially across other EU member states for the foreseeable future, including during any period while the terms of Brexit are being negotiated and such uncertainties   could impair or limit our ability to transact business in the member EU states.  

Further, Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets,   and the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the Euro  .    We are exposed to the economic, market and fiscal conditions in the UK and the EU and to changes in any of these conditions. Depending on the terms reached regarding Brexit, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational implications on our business.  

A significant amount of the regulatory regime that applies to us in the UK is derived from EU directives and regulations. For so long as the UK remains a member of the EU, those sources of legislation will (unless otherwise repealed or amended) remain in effect. However,   Brexit could   change the legal and regulatory framework within the UK where we operate and   is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.   Consequently, no assurance can be given as to the impact of Brexit and, in particular, no assurance can be given that our operating results, financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result.

Excluding the name of Borrower, the following is a complete list of all assumed business names under which Borrower does business:    None. 

Authorization.    Borrower's execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and all the Related Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action by Borrower and do not conflict with, result in a violation of, or constitute a default under  (1)  any provision of  (a)  Borrower's articles of incorporation or organization, or bylaws, or  (b)  any agreement or other instrument binding upon Borrower or  (2)  any law, governmental regulation, court decree, or order applicable to Borrower or to Borrower's properties. 

Financial Information.    Each of Borrower's financial statements supplied to Lender truly and completely disclosed Borrower's financial condition as of the date of the statement, and there has been no material adverse change in Borrower's financial condition subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statement supplied to Lender.  Borrower has no material contingent obligations except as disclosed in such financial statements. 

Legal Effect.    This Agreement constitutes, and any instrument or agreement Borrower is required to give under this Agreement when delivered will constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

Hazardous Substances.    Except as disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing, Borrower represents and warrants that:  (1)  During the period of Borrower's ownership of the Collateral, there has been no use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance by any person on, under, about or from any of the Collateral.

(3)  Neither Borrower nor any tenant, contractor, agent or other authorized user of any of the Collateral shall use, generate, manufacture, store, treat, dispose of or release any Hazardous Substance on, under, about or from any of the Collateral; and any such activity shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, including without limitation all Environmental Laws.  Borrower authorizes Lender and its agents to   

enter upon the Collateral to make such inspections and tests as Lender may deem appropriate to determine compliance of the Collateral with this section of the Agreement.  Any inspections or tests made by Lender shall be at Borrower's expense and for Lender's purposes only and shall not be construed to create any responsibility or liability on the part of Lender to Borrower or to any other person.  The representations and warranties contained herein are based on Borrower's due diligence in investigating the Collateral for hazardous waste and Hazardous Substances.  Borrower hereby  (1)  releases and waives any future claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the event Borrower becomes liable for cleanup or other costs under any such laws, and  (2)  agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lender against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, and expenses which Lender may directly or indirectly sustain or suffer resulting from a breach of this section of the Agreement or as a consequence of any use, generation, manufacture, storage, disposal, release or threatened release of a hazardous waste or substance on the Collateral.  The provisions of this section of the Agreement, including the obligation to indemnify and defend, shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the termination, expiration or satisfaction of this Agreement and shall not be affected by Lender's acquisition of any interest in any of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure or otherwise. 

Litigation and Claims.    No litigation, claim, investigation, administrative proceeding or similar action (including those for unpaid taxes) against Borrower is pending or threatened, and no other event has occurred which may materially adversely affect Borrower's financial condition or properties, other than litigation, claims, or other events, if any, that have been disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing. 

Taxes.    To the best of Borrower's knowledge, all of Borrower's tax returns and reports that are or were required to be filed, have been filed, and all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges have been paid in full, except those presently being or to be contested by Borrower in good faith in the ordinary course of business and for which adequate reserves have been provided.  

Lien Priority.    Unless otherwise previously disclosed to Lender in writing, Borrower has not entered into or granted any Security Agreements, or permitted the filing or attachment of any Security Interests on or affecting any of the Collateral directly or indirectly securing repayment of Borrower's Loan and Note, that would be prior or that may in any way be superior to Lender's Security Interests and rights in and to such Collateral. 

Binding Effect.    This Agreement, the Note, all Security Agreements (if any), and all Related Documents are binding upon the signers thereof, as well as upon their successors, representatives and assigns, and are legally enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.

NON-COMPLIANCE FEE.   Borrower acknowledges that if Borrower fails to timely furnish Lender with any financial record(s) required by this Agreement or otherwise fails to timely perform any other term, obligation or covenant required by this Agreement and Related Documents (singularly and collectively      Non-Compliance     ),     Lender will incur costs and damages as a result of Borrower     s Non-Compliance, and in consideration of such costs and damages, Borrower agrees to pay Lender a fee equal to 2.500% per annum of the then outstanding loan balance, calculated     based on a 30 day month over 360 days per year (     Predetermined Fee Amount     ).      Any fee under this section will be imposed monthly in the Predetermined Fee Amount and due on the interest payment due date     until the Non-Compliance is cured by Borrower. A Predetermined Fee Amount will be calculated and imposed in accordance with this section for each recurring event of Non-Compliance. 

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.    If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Collateral or if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Borrower's failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Borrower is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Borrower's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on any Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving any Collateral.  All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Borrower.  All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either  (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity. 

NEGATIVE COVENANTS.    Borrower covenants and agrees with Lender that while this Agreement is in effect, Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender:  

Continuity of Operations.    (1) Engage in any business activities substantially different than those in which Borrower is presently engaged, (2)  cease operations, liquidate, merge, transfer, acquire or consolidate with any other entity, change its name, dissolve or transfer or sell Collateral out of the ordinary course of business, or (3) pay any dividends on Borrower's stock (other than dividends payable in its stock), provided, however that notwithstanding the foregoing, but only so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the payment of dividends, if Borrower is a "Subchapter S Corporation" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), Borrower may pay cash dividends on its stock to its shareholders from time to time in amounts necessary to enable the shareholders to pay income taxes and make estimated income tax payments to satisfy their liabilities under federal and state law which arise solely from their status as Shareholders of a Subchapter S Corporation because of their ownership of shares of Borrower's stock, or purchase or retire any of Borrower's outstanding shares or alter or amend Borrower's capital structure.  

Agreements.    Enter into any agreement containing any provisions which would be violated or breached by the performance of Borrower's obligations under this Agreement or in connection herewith. 

CESSATION OF ADVANCES.    If Lender has made any commitment to make any Loan to Borrower, whether under this Agreement or under any other agreement, Lender shall have no obligation to make Loan Advances or to disburse Loan proceeds if:  (A)  Borrower or any Guarantor is in default under the terms of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents or any other agreement that Borrower or any Guarantor has with Lender;  (B)  Borrower or any Guarantor dies, becomes incompetent or becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy or similar proceedings, or is adjudged a bankrupt;  (C)  there occurs a material adverse change in Borrower's financial condition, in the financial condition of any Guarantor, or in the value of any Collateral   

securing any Loan; or (D) any Guarantor seeks, claims or otherwise attempts to limit, modify or revoke such Guarantor's guaranty of the Loan or any other loan with Lender. 

DEFAULT.    Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment Default.    Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Loan. 

Other Defaults.    Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower. 

Default in Favor of Third Parties.    Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower's or any Grantor's property or Borrower's or any Grantor's ability to repay the Loans or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements.    Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Insolvency.    The dissolution or termination of Borrower's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower. 

Defective Collateralization.    This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.    Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Loan.  This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender.  However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Events Affecting Guarantor.    Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Change in Ownership.    Any change in ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the common stock of Borrower. 

Adverse Change.    A material adverse change occurs in Borrower's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Loan is impaired. 

Right to Cure.    If any default, other than a default on Indebtedness, is curable and if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, has not been given a notice of a similar default within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, demanding cure of such default:  (1)  cure the default within fifteen (15) days; or  (2)  if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiate steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continue and complete all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

Other Defaults Modified.   Notwithstanding the section above entitled      Other Defaults     , Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or Agreement or in any of the Related Documents between Lender and Borrower; or any shareholder, member, trustor, or any owner of the Borrower also holding a controlling interest in any given entity     s common stock, membership interest, trust interest, or any other ownership interest (     Related Entity     ), fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and the Related Entity. 

EFFECT OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.    If any Event of Default shall occur, except where otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Related Documents, all commitments and obligations of Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents or any other agreement immediately will terminate (including any obligation to make further Loan Advances or disbursements), and, at Lender's option, all Indebtedness immediately will become due and payable, all without notice of any kind to Borrower, except that in the case of an Event of Default of the type described in the "Insolvency" subsection above, such acceleration shall be automatic and not optional.  In addition, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies provided in the Related Documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise.  Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.  Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower or of any Grantor shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and to exercise its rights and remedies. 

PRIOR LOAN AGREEMENT.   This Loan Agreement supersedes, replaces and restates in its entirety that certain Business Loan Agreement dated September 15, 2006 entered into between Borrower and Lender, together with all modifications thereto (the      Prior Loan Agreement     ).      The Prior Loan Agreement shall have no further force and effect. 

CROSS ACCELERATION.

Consent to Loan Participation.    Borrower agrees and consents to Lender's sale or transfer, whether now or later, of one or more participation interests in the Loan to one or more purchasers, whether related or unrelated to Lender.  Lender may provide, without any limitation whatsoever, to any one or more purchasers, or potential purchasers, any information or knowledge Lender may have about Borrower or about any other matter relating to the Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any rights to privacy Borrower may have with respect to such matters.  Borrower additionally waives any and all notices of sale of participation interests, as well as all notices of any repurchase of such participation interests.  Borrower also agrees that the purchasers of any such participation interests will be considered as the absolute owners of such interests in the Loan and will have all the rights granted under the participation agreement or agreements governing the sale of such participation interests.  Borrower further waives all rights of offset or counterclaim that it may have now or later against Lender or against any purchaser of such a participation interest and unconditionally agrees that either Lender or such purchaser may enforce Borrower's obligation under the Loan irrespective of the failure or insolvency of any holder of any interest in the Loan.  Borrower further agrees that the purchaser of any such participation interests may enforce its interests irrespective of any personal claims or defenses that Borrower may have against Lender. 

Governing Law.  This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of California. 

No Waiver by Lender.    Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender.  No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right.  A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender's right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement.  No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Borrower, or between Lender and any Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender's rights or of any of Borrower's or any Grantor's obligations as to any future transactions.  Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Notices.    Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Agreement.  Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party's address.  For notice purposes, Borrower agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Borrower's current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Borrower, any notice given by Lender to any Borrower is deemed to be notice given to all Borrowers. 

Severability.    If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance.  If feasible, the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable.  If the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 

Subsidiaries and Affiliates of Borrower.    To the extent the context of any provisions of this Agreement makes it appropriate, including without limitation any representation, warranty or covenant, the word "Borrower" as used in this Agreement shall include all of Borrower's subsidiaries and affiliates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing however, under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed to require Lender to make any Loan or other financial accommodation to any of Borrower's subsidiaries or affiliates. 

Successors and Assigns.    All covenants and agreements by or on behalf of Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Related Documents shall bind Borrower's successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns. Borrower shall not, however, have the right to assign Borrower's rights under this Agreement or any interest therein, without the prior written consent of Lender. 

Survival of Representations and Warranties.    Borrower understands and agrees that in making the Loan, Lender is relying on all representations, warranties, and covenants made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by Borrower to Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents.  Borrower further agrees that regardless of any investigation made by Lender, all such representations, warranties and covenants will survive the making of the Loan and delivery to Lender of the Related Documents, shall be continuing in nature, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as Borrower's Indebtedness shall be paid in full, or until this Agreement shall be terminated in the manner provided above, whichever is the last to occur. 

Time is of the Essence.    Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. 

Waive Jury.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, all parties to this Agreement hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any party against any other party. 

Judicial Reference.   If the waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, who shall be a retired state or federal court judge, mutually selected by the parties or, if they cannot agree, then any party may seek to have a private judge appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure        638 and 640 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts). The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure        638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers.      All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure       644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph. 

The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the referenced proceedings.      The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or   

controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.      The costs shall be borne equally by the parties. 

Oral Agreements Not Effective.   This Note or Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.

Neither this Note or Agreement nor any other Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this section.      Lender may from time to time, (a) enter into with Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as Lender may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Note or Agreement or the Related Documents or any Event Default and its consequences, if, but only if, such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.

CHANGE IN TERMS AGREEMENT 

DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS.    The Promissory Note dated September 15, 2006, for loan number   28933  , in the original Principal Amount of $2,775,000.00, along with any and all subsequent Change In Terms Agreements. 

DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL.        Borrower acknowledges this Agreement is secured by the following collateral described in the security instruments listed herein: 

(A)  a Deed of Trust dated September 8, 2016, to a trustee in favor of Lender on real property described as "Real Property located at 11480 6th Street, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730" and located in San Bernardino County, State of California.    That agreement contains the following due on sale provision:  Lender may, at Lender's option, declare immediately due and payable all sums secured by the Deed of Trust upon the sale or transfer, without Lender's prior written consent, of all or any part of the Real Property, or any interest in the Real Property.  A "sale or transfer" means the conveyance of Real Property or any right, title or interest in the Real Property; whether legal, beneficial or equitable; whether voluntary or involuntary; whether by outright sale, deed, installment sale contract, land contract, contract for deed, leasehold interest with a term greater than three (3) years, lease-option contract, or by sale, assignment, or transfer of any beneficial interest in or to any land trust holding title to the Real Property, or by any other method of conveyance of an interest in the Real Property.  If any Borrower is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, transfer also includes any change in ownership of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting stock, partnership interests or limited liability company interests, as the case may be, of such Borrower.  However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by applicable law. 

(B)  an Assignment of All Rents to Lender on real property located in San Bernardino County, State of California. 

(C)      All Financial Contracts and all proceeds thereof, including all accounts and general Intangibles, described in a Commercial Security Agreement dated September 8, 2016  . 

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS.    The   Maturity   date of the Note is hereby extended from September 15, 2016 to   October 5, 2026. 

The Current Outstanding Loan Balance   of the Note is hereby increased to Three Million Five Hundred Ninety One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars.   ($3,591,250.00) 

Effective September 15, 2016  , the sections entitled   "PAYMENT"   and   "VARIABLE INTEREST RATE"   are hereby amended and restated as follows:. 

PAYMENT.  Borrower will pay this loan as set forth in the attached Exhibit "A". Borrower's first principal payment is due November 5, 2016, and all subsequent principal payments are due on the same day of each month after that.  In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning October 5, 2016 with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that.  Borrower's final payment due October 5, 2026, will be for all principal and all accrued interest not yet paid.    Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first to any accrued unpaid interest; then to principal; then to any late charges; and then to any unpaid collection costs.  Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing  . 

VARIABLE INTEREST RATE.    The interest rate on this loan is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the rate quoted by Lender for successive 1 month LIBOR Interest Periods.       LIBOR Interest Period      means a period of 1 month, determined and adjusted by Lender in accordance with the custom and practice for transactions in Eurodollars conducted in London, England and the provisions of this section.  Such interest rate shall be equivalent to Lender     s LIBOR Rate which is that rate determined by Lender     s Treasury Desk to be the rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period of 1-month which appears on the Bloomberg Screen B TMM Page under the heading      LIBOR Fix      as of 11:00 am (London Time) on the second Business Day prior to the first day of such period (adjusted for any and all assessments, surcharges and reserve requirements).  If such interest rate shall cease to be available from the described Bloomberg report, the London interbank offered rate shall be determined from such financial reporting service as Lender shall reasonably determine and use with respect to its other loan facilities on which interest is determined based on the London interbank offered rate. The LIBOR Rate shall be adjusted to occur on the same day as the payment due date as set forth in the section entitled Payment Due Date below (the "Index").  The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans.  If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower.  Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request.  The interest rate change will not occur more often than each 1 month.  Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well.    The Index currently is 0.525% per annum.    Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this loan will be calculated as described in the "INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD" paragraph using a rate of 2.750 percentage points over the Index, adjusted if necessary for any minimum and maximum rate limitations described below, resulting in an initial rate of 3.275%.  NOTICE:  Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this loan be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.  Whenever increases occur in the interest rate, Lender, at its option, may do one or more of the following:  (A)  increase Borrower's payments to ensure Borrower's loan will pay off by its original final maturity date,  (B)  increase Borrower's payments to cover accruing interest,  (C)  increase the number of Borrower's payments, and  (D)  continue Borrower's payments at the same amount and increase Borrower's final payment. 

INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD.  Interest on this loan is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.  All interest payable under this loan is computed using this method. 

BUSINESS DAY.   Any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday or any day on which commercial banks in Los Angeles, California, are authorized or required to close. 

PAYMENT DUE DATE.   If any payment required to be made by the Borrower hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 

The section entitled   "INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT"   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.    Upon default, the interest rate on this loan shall, if permitted under applicable law, immediately increase by adding an   

additional 5.000 percentage point margin ("Default Rate Margin").  The Default Rate Margin shall also apply to each succeeding interest rate change that would have applied had there been no default. 

The section entitled   "Late Charge"   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

LATE CHARGE.    If a payment is 11 days or more late, Borrower will be charged   6.000% of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment or $5.00, whichever is greater.  

The section entitled   "Other Defaults Modified"   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

Other Defaults Modified  . Notwithstanding the section above entitled      Other Defaults     , Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or Agreement or in any of the Related Documents between Lender and Borrower; or any shareholder, member, trustor, or any owner of the Borrower also holding a controlling interest in any given entity     s common stock, membership interest, trust interest, or any other ownership interest (     Related Entity     ), fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and the Related Entity 

The section entitled   "DISHONORED ITEM FEE"   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

DISHONORED ITEM FEE.    Borrower will pay a fee to Lender of $25.00 if Borrower makes a payment on Borrower's loan and the check or preauthorized charge with which Borrower pays is later dishonored. 

CHOICE OF VENUE.   If there is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Los Angeles County, State of California. 

JUDICIAL REFERENCE.   If the waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, who shall be a retired state or federal court judge, mutually selected by the parties or, if they cannot agree, then any party may seek to have a private judge appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure        638 and 640 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts). The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure        638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers.      All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure       644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph. 

The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the referenced proceedings.      The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.      The costs shall be borne equally by the parties. 

ORAL AGREEMENTS NOT EFFECTIVE.   This Note or Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.      Moreover, any subsequent oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings of the parties shall not be effective against Lender unless (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.      Borrower shall not rely or act on any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties at anytime whatsoever, including before or during any Lender approval process stated above.      Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower shall be responsible for its own actions, including any detrimental reliance on any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties and that Lender shall not be liable for any possible claims, counterclaims, demands, actions, causes of action, damages, costs, expenses and liability whatsoever, known or unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, suspected or unsuspected, at law or in equity, originating in whole or in part in connection with any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties which the Borrower may now or hereafter claim against the Lender.      Neither this Note or Agreement nor any other Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this section.      Lender may from time to time, (a) enter into with Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as Lender may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Note or Agreement or the Related Documents or any Event Default and its consequences, if, but only if, such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.      Then such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and specific purpose for which given. 

CONTINUING VALIDITY.    Except as expressly changed by this Agreement, the terms of the original obligation or obligations, including all agreements evidenced or securing the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect.  Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not waive Lender's right to strict performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any future change in terms.  Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a satisfaction of the obligation(s).  It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing.  Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released by virtue of this Agreement.  If any person who signed the original obligation does not sign this Agreement below, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Agreement is given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing party consents to the changes and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise will not be released by it.  This waiver applies not only to any initial extension, modification or release, but also to all such subsequent actions.

This ADDENDUM TO CHANGE IN TERMS AGREEMENT- INTEREST RATE SWAP is attached to and by this reference is made a part of the Change In Terms Agreement, dated September 8, 2016, and executed in connection with a loan or other financial accommodations between EAST WEST BANK and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

Re: Loan #28933 

The following sentence is hereby added to the paragraph headed "PREPAYMENT; MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE"  : 

"Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, Borrower must consult with Lender prior to making any prepayments when a Financial Contract has been executed between Borrower and Lender in connection with this Note.  Borrower acknowledges that partial prepayments of the Note will require the Financial Contract to be amended." 

Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, Borrower shall remain obligated to pay any fee due and owing under the Financial Contract, including but not limited to any fee owed upon early termination of the Financial Contract.  

The subparagraph headed "Other Defaults," in the paragraph headed "DEFAULT," is hereby amended to read as follows: 

"Other Defaults.    Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement including but not limited to any Financial Contract between Lender and Borrower." 

The subparagraph headed "Cure Provisions," in the paragraph headed "DEFAULT," is hereby amended to read as follows: 

"Cure Provisions  .  If any default, other than a default in payment or in a Financial Contract, is curable and if Borrower has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Note within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical." 

The following sentence is hereby added to the paragraph headed "COLLATERAL     : 

Borrower     s obligations under the Financial Contract shall be secured by the Deed of Trust described in this section.  

The following DEFINITION is hereby added to the Note: 

"Financial Contract.    The words "Financial Contract" mean (1) an agreement (including terms and conditions incorporated by reference therein) which is a rate swap agreement, basis swap, forward rate agreement, commodity swap, commodity option, equity or equity index swap, bond option, interest rate option, foreign exchange agreement, rate cap agreement, rate floor agreement, rate collar agreement, currency swap agreement, cross-currency rate swap agreement, currency option, any other similar agreement (including any option to enter into any of the foregoing); or (2) any combination of the foregoing. 

Financial Contract Interest Rate  .  If Borrower enters into a Financial Contract, the applicable interest rate on the Note as of the effective date of the Financial Contract shall be as follows: 

VARIABLE INTEREST RATE for Financial Contract Interest Rate  .  The interest rate on this Note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the rate quoted by Lender for successive 1 month LIBOR Interest Periods.       LIBOR Interest Period      means a period of 1 month, determined and adjusted by Lender in accordance with the custom and practice for transactions in Eurodollars conducted in London, England and the provisions of this section.  Such interest rate shall be equivalent to Lender     s LIBOR Rate which is that rate determined by Lender     s Treasury Desk to be the rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period of 1-month which appears on the Bloomberg Screen B TMM Page under the heading      LIBOR Fix      as of 11:00 am (London Time) on the second Business Day prior to the first day of such period (adjusted for any and all assessments, surcharges and reserve requirements).  If such interest rate shall cease to be available from the described Bloomberg report, the London interbank offered rate shall be determined from such financial reporting service as Lender shall reasonably determine and use with respect to its other loan facilities on which interest is determined based on the London interbank offered rate. The LIBOR Rate shall be adjusted to occur on the same day as the payment due date as set forth in the section entitled Payment Due Date below (the "Index").  The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans.  If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower.  Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request.  The interest rate change will not occur more often than each 1 month.  Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well.    The Index currently is 0.525 per annum.    Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this Note will be calculated as described in the "INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD" paragraph using a rate of 2.750 percentage points over the Index, resulting in an initial rate of 3.275%.  NOTICE:  Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law.  Whenever increases occur in the interest rate, Lender, at its option, may do one or more of the following:  (A)  increase Borrower's payments to ensure Borrower's loan will pay off by its original final maturity date,  (B)  increase Borrower's payments to cover accruing interest,  (C)  increase the number of Borrower's payments, and  (D)  continue Borrower's payments at the same amount and increase Borrower's final payment. 

Financial Contract Interest After Default  .  If Borrower enters into a Financial Contract, the applicable interest rate upon default will be calculated as provided for in the section entitled "INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT" of the Note. 

Financial Contract as a Separate and Distinct Obligation.   Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the Loan Documents, and without impairing Lender     s right under the Loan Documents, the amounts payable by Borrower under the Financial Contracts shall be, and at all times shall remain, separate and independent debts owed by Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Financial Contract. .

COMMERCIAL SECURITY AGREEMENT 

THIS COMMERCIAL SECURITY AGREEMENT dated September 8, 2016, is made and executed between Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Grantor") and East West Bank ("Lender"). 

GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.  For valuable consideration, Grantor grants to Lender a security interest in the Collateral to secure the Indebtedness and agrees that Lender shall have the rights stated in this Agreement with respect to the Collateral, in addition to all other rights which Lender may have by law. 

COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION.    The word "Collateral" as used in this Agreement means the following described property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and wherever located, in which Grantor is giving to Lender a security interest for the payment of the Indebtedness and performance of all other obligations under the Note and this Agreement: 

All Financial Contracts and all proceeds thereof, including all accounts, general intangibles and investment property payable to or receivable by Grantor under any Financial Contract 

In addition, the word "Collateral" also includes all the following, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and wherever located: 

(A)  All accessions, attachments, accessories, replacements of and additions to any of the collateral described herein, whether added now or later.

(C)  All accounts, general intangibles, instruments, rents, monies, payments, and all other rights, arising out of a sale, lease, consignment or other disposition of any of the property described in this Collateral section. 

(D)  All proceeds (including insurance proceeds) from the sale, destruction, loss, or other disposition of any of the property described in this Collateral section, and sums due from a third party who has damaged or destroyed the Collateral or from that party's insurer, whether due to judgment, settlement or other process. 

(E)  All records and data relating to any of the property described in this Collateral section, whether in the form of a writing, photograph, microfilm, microfiche, or electronic media, together with all of Grantor's right, title, and interest in and to all computer software required to utilize, create, maintain, and process any such records or data on electronic media. 

GRANTOR'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL.    With respect to the Collateral, Grantor represents and promises to Lender that: 

Perfection of Security Interest.    Grantor agrees to take whatever actions are requested by Lender to perfect and continue Lender's security interest in the Collateral.  Upon request of Lender, Grantor will deliver to Lender any and all of the documents evidencing or constituting the Collateral, and Grantor will note Lender's interest upon any and all chattel paper and instruments if not delivered to Lender for possession by Lender. 

Notices to Lender.    Grantor will promptly notify Lender in writing at Lender's address shown above (or such other addresses as Lender may designate from time to time) prior to any  (1)  change in Grantor's name;  (2)  change in Grantor's assumed business name(s);  (3)  change in the management of the Corporation Grantor;  (4)  change in the authorized signer(s);  (5)  change in Grantor's principal office address;  (6)  change in Grantor's state of organization;  (7)  conversion of Grantor to a new or different type of business entity; or  (8)  change in any other aspect of Grantor that directly or indirectly relates to any agreements between Grantor and Lender.  No change in Grantor's name or state of organization will take effect until after Lender has received notice. 

No Violation.    The execution and delivery of this Agreement will not violate any law or agreement governing Grantor or to which Grantor is a party, and its certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws do not prohibit any term or condition of this Agreement. 

Enforceability of Collateral.    To the extent the Collateral consists of accounts, chattel paper, or general intangibles, as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code, the Collateral is enforceable in accordance with its terms, is genuine, and fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations concerning form, content and manner of preparation and execution, and all persons appearing to be obligated on the Collateral have authority and capacity to contract and are in fact obligated as they appear to be on the Collateral.  At the time any account becomes subject to a security interest in favor of Lender, the account shall be a good and valid account representing an undisputed, bona fide indebtedness incurred by the account debtor, for merchandise held subject to delivery instructions or previously shipped or delivered pursuant to a contract of sale, or for services previously performed by Grantor with or for the account debtor.  So long as this Agreement remains in effect, Grantor shall not, without Lender's prior written consent, compromise, settle, adjust, or extend payment under or with regard to any such Accounts.  There shall be no setoffs or counterclaims against any of the Collateral, and no agreement shall have been made under which any deductions or discounts may be claimed concerning the Collateral except those disclosed to Lender in writing. 

Location of the Collateral.    Except in the ordinary course of Grantor's business, Grantor agrees to keep the Collateral (or to the extent the Collateral consists of intangible property such as accounts or general intangibles, the records concerning the Collateral) at Grantor's address shown above or at such other locations as are acceptable to Lender.  Upon Lender's request, Grantor will deliver to Lender in form satisfactory to Lender a schedule of real properties and Collateral locations relating to Grantor's operations, including without limitation the following:  (1)  all real property Grantor owns or is purchasing;  (2)   all real property Grantor is renting or leasing;  (3)  all storage facilities Grantor owns, rents, leases, or uses; and  (4)  all other properties where Collateral is or may be located. 

Removal of the Collateral.    Except in the ordinary course of Grantor's business,  Grantor shall not remove the Collateral from its existing location without Lender's prior written consent.  Grantor shall, whenever requested, advise Lender of the exact location of the Collateral.   

Transactions Involving Collateral.    Except for inventory sold or accounts collected in the ordinary course of Grantor's business, or as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Grantor shall not sell, offer to sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Collateral.  Grantor shall not pledge, mortgage,   

encumber or otherwise permit the Collateral to be subject to any lien, security interest, encumbrance, or charge, other than the security interest provided for in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Lender.  This includes security interests even if junior in right to the security interests granted under this Agreement.  Unless waived by Lender, all proceeds from any disposition of the Collateral (for whatever reason) shall be held in trust for Lender and shall not be commingled with any other funds; provided however, this requirement shall not constitute consent by Lender to any sale or other disposition.  Upon receipt, Grantor shall immediately deliver any such proceeds to Lender.  

Title.    Grantor represents and warrants to Lender that Grantor holds good and marketable title to the Collateral, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except for the lien of this Agreement.  No financing statement covering any of the Collateral is on file in any public office other than those which reflect the security interest created by this Agreement or to which Lender has specifically consented.  Grantor shall defend Lender's rights in the Collateral against the claims and demands of all other persons. 

Repairs and Maintenance.    Grantor agrees to keep and maintain, and to cause others to keep and maintain, the Collateral in good order, repair and condition at all times while this Agreement remains in effect.  Grantor further agrees to pay when due all claims for work done on, or services rendered or material furnished in connection with the Collateral so that no lien or encumbrance may ever attach to or be filed against the Collateral. 

Inspection of Collateral.    Lender and Lender's designated representatives and agents shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine and inspect the Collateral wherever located. 

Taxes, Assessments and Liens.    Grantor will pay when due all taxes, assessments and liens upon the Collateral, its use or operation, upon this Agreement, upon any promissory note or notes evidencing the Indebtedness, or upon any of the other Related Documents.  Grantor may withhold any such payment or may elect to contest any lien if Grantor is in good faith conducting an appropriate proceeding to contest the obligation to pay and so long as Lender's interest in the Collateral is not jeopardized in Lender's sole opinion.  If the Collateral is subjected to a lien which is not discharged within fifteen (15) days, Grantor shall deposit with Lender cash, a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security satisfactory to Lender in an amount adequate to provide for the discharge of the lien plus any interest, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees or other charges that could accrue as a result of foreclosure or sale of the Collateral.  In any contest Grantor shall defend itself and Lender and shall satisfy any final adverse judgment before enforcement against the Collateral.  Grantor shall name Lender as an additional obligee under any surety bond furnished in the contest proceedings.  Grantor further agrees to furnish Lender with evidence that such taxes, assessments, and governmental and other charges have been paid in full and in a timely manner.  Grantor may withhold any such payment or may elect to contest any lien if Grantor is in good faith conducting an appropriate proceeding to contest the obligation to pay and so long as Lender's interest in the Collateral is not jeopardized. 

Compliance with Governmental Requirements.    Grantor shall comply promptly with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities, now or hereafter in effect, applicable to the ownership, production, disposition, or use of the Collateral, including all laws or regulations relating to the undue erosion of highly-erodible land or relating to the conversion of wetlands for the production of an agricultural product or commodity.  Grantor may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance or regulation and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Lender's interest in the Collateral, in Lender's opinion, is not jeopardized. 

Hazardous Substances.    Grantor represents and warrants that the Collateral never has been, and never will be so long as this Agreement remains a lien on the Collateral, used in violation of any Environmental Laws or for the generation, manufacture, storage, transportation, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance.  The representations and warranties contained herein are based on Grantor's due diligence in investigating the Collateral for Hazardous Substances.  Grantor hereby  (1)  releases and waives any future claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the event Grantor becomes liable for cleanup or other costs under any Environmental Laws, and  (2)  agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lender against any and all claims and losses resulting from a breach of this provision of this Agreement.  This obligation to indemnify and defend shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the satisfaction of this Agreement. 

Maintenance of Casualty Insurance.    Grantor shall procure and maintain all risks insurance, including without limitation fire, theft and liability coverage together with such other insurance as Lender may require with respect to the Collateral, in form, amounts, coverages and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender.  Grantor, upon request of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and not including any disclaimer of the insurer's liability for failure to give such a notice.  Each insurance policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or default of Grantor or any other person.  In connection with all policies covering assets in which Lender holds or is offered a security interest, Grantor will provide Lender with such loss payable or other endorsements as Lender may require.  If Grantor at any time fails to obtain or maintain any insurance as required under this Agreement, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) obtain such insurance as Lender deems appropriate, including if Lender so chooses "single interest insurance," which will cover only Lender's interest in the Collateral. 

Application of Insurance Proceeds.    Grantor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Collateral if the estimated cost of repair or replacement exceeds $10,000.00, whether or not such casualty or loss is covered by insurance.  Lender may make proof of loss if Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty.  All proceeds of any insurance on the Collateral, including accrued proceeds thereon, shall be held by Lender as part of the Collateral.  If Lender consents to repair or replacement of the damaged or destroyed Collateral, Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of expenditure,  pay or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration.  If Lender does not consent to repair or replacement of the Collateral, Lender shall retain a sufficient amount of the proceeds to pay all of the Indebtedness, and shall pay the balance to Grantor.  Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within six (6) months after their receipt and which Grantor has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Collateral shall be used to prepay the Indebtedness. 

Insurance Reserves.    Lender may require Grantor to maintain with Lender reserves for payment of insurance premiums, which reserves shall be created by monthly payments from Grantor of a sum estimated by Lender to be sufficient to produce, at least fifteen (15) days before the premium due date, amounts at least equal to the insurance premiums to be paid.  If fifteen (15) days before payment is due, the reserve funds are insufficient, Grantor shall upon demand pay any deficiency to Lender.  The reserve funds shall be held by Lender as a general deposit and shall constitute a non-interest-bearing account which Lender may satisfy by payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor as they become due.  Lender does not hold the reserve funds in trust for Grantor, and Lender is not the agent of Grantor for payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor.  The responsibility for the payment of premiums shall remain Grantor's sole responsibility. 

Insurance Reports.    Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to Lender reports on each existing policy of insurance showing such information as Lender may reasonably request including the following:  (1)  the name of the insurer;  (2)  the risks insured;  (3)  the amount of the policy;  (4)  the property insured;  (5)  the then current value on the basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of determining that value; and  (6)  the expiration date of the policy.  In addition, Grantor shall upon request by Lender (however not more often than annually) have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine, as applicable, the cash value or replacement cost of the Collateral. 

Financing Statements.    Grantor authorizes Lender to file a UCC financing statement, or alternatively, a copy of this Agreement to perfect Lender's security interest.  At Lender's request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect, protect, and continue   

Lender's security interest in the Property.  This includes making sure Lender is shown as the first and only security interest holder on the title covering the Property.  Grantor will pay all filing fees, title transfer fees, and other fees and costs involved unless prohibited by law or unless Lender is required by law to pay such fees and costs.  Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender to execute documents necessary to transfer title if there is a default.  Lender may file a copy of this Agreement as a financing statement. 

GRANTOR'S RIGHT TO POSSESSION AND TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS.    Until default and except as otherwise provided below with respect to accounts, Grantor may have possession of the tangible personal property and beneficial use of all the Collateral and may use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Related Documents, provided that Grantor's right to possession and beneficial use shall not apply to any Collateral where possession of the Collateral by Lender is required by law to perfect Lender's security interest in such Collateral.  Until otherwise notified by Lender, Grantor may collect any of the Collateral consisting of accounts.  At any time and even though no Event of Default exists, Lender may exercise its rights to collect the accounts and to notify account debtors to make payments directly to Lender for application to the Indebtedness.  If Lender at any time has possession of any Collateral, whether before or after an Event of Default, Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if Lender takes such action for that purpose as Grantor shall request or as Lender, in Lender's sole discretion, shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, but failure to honor any request by Grantor shall not of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.  Lender shall not be required to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights in the Collateral against prior parties, nor to protect, preserve or maintain any security interest given to secure the Indebtedness. 

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.    If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral.  All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor.  All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will  (A)  be payable on demand;  (B)  be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either  (1)  the term of any applicable insurance policy; or  (2)  the remaining term of the Note; or  (C)  be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity.  The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts.  Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. 

DEFAULT.    Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment Default.    Grantor fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. 

Other Defaults.    Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Grantor. 

Default in Favor of Third Parties.    Any guarantor or Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of any guarantor's or Grantor's property or ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements.    Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor's behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Defective Collateralization.    This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Insolvency.    The dissolution or termination of Grantor's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Grantor's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.    Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness.  This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender.  However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.  

Events Affecting Guarantor.    Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse Change.    A material adverse change occurs in Grantor's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. 

Cure Provisions.    If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after Lender sends written notice to Grantor demanding cure of such default:  (1)  cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or  (2)  if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT.    If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, at any time thereafter, Lender shall have all the rights of a secured party under the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code.  In addition and without limitation, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies: 

Accelerate Indebtedness.    Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to Grantor. 

Assemble Collateral.    Lender may require Grantor to deliver to Lender all or any portion of the Collateral and any and all certificates of title and other documents relating to the Collateral.  Lender may require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Lender at a place to be designated by Lender.  Lender also shall have full power to enter upon the property of Grantor to take possession of and remove the Collateral.  If the Collateral contains other goods not covered by this Agreement at the time of repossession, Grantor agrees Lender may take such other goods, provided that Lender makes reasonable efforts to return them to Grantor after repossession. 

Sell the Collateral.    Lender shall have full power to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise deal with the Collateral or proceeds thereof in Lender's own name or that of Grantor.  Lender may sell the Collateral at public auction or private sale.  Unless the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender will give Grantor, and other persons as required by law, reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or any other disposition of the Collateral is to be made.  However, no notice need be provided to any person who, after Event of Default occurs, enters into and authenticates an agreement waiving that person's right to notification of sale.  The requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is given at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition.  All expenses relating to the disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation the expenses of retaking, holding, insuring, preparing for sale and selling the Collateral, shall become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Agreement and shall be payable on demand, with interest at the Note rate from date of expenditure until repaid. 

Appoint Receiver.    Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, with the power to protect and preserve the Collateral, to operate the Collateral preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the rents from the Collateral and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness.  The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law.  Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Collateral exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount.  Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver. 

Collect Revenues, Apply Accounts.    Lender, either itself or through a receiver, may collect the payments, rents, income, and revenues from the Collateral.  Lender may at any time in Lender's discretion transfer any Collateral into Lender's own name or that of Lender's nominee and receive the payments, rents, income, and revenues therefrom and hold the same as security for the Indebtedness or apply it to payment of the Indebtedness in such order of preference as Lender may determine.  Insofar as the Collateral consists of accounts, general intangibles, insurance policies, instruments, chattel paper, choses in action, or similar property, Lender may demand, collect, receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose, or realize on the Collateral as Lender may determine, whether or not Indebtedness or Collateral is then due.  For these purposes, Lender may, on behalf of and in the name of Grantor, receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to Grantor; change any address to which mail and payments are to be sent; and endorse notes, checks, drafts, money orders, documents of title, instruments and items pertaining to payment, shipment, or storage of any Collateral.  To facilitate collection, Lender may notify account debtors and obligors on any Collateral to make payments directly to Lender. 

Obtain Deficiency.    If Lender chooses to sell any or all of the Collateral, Lender may obtain a judgment against Grantor for any deficiency remaining on the Indebtedness due to Lender after application of all amounts received from the exercise of the rights provided in this Agreement.  Grantor shall be liable for a deficiency even if the transaction described in this subsection is a sale of accounts or chattel paper.   

Other Rights and Remedies.    Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, as may be amended from time to time.  In addition, Lender shall have and may exercise any or all other rights and remedies it may have available at law, in equity, or otherwise. 

Election of Remedies.    Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement, the Related Documents, or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.  Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor's failure to perform, shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and exercise its remedies. 

JUDICIAL REFERENCE.   If the waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, who shall be a retired state or federal court judge, mutually selected by the parties or, if they cannot agree, then any party may seek to have a private judge appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure        638 and 640 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts). The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure        638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers.      All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure       644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph. 

The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the referenced proceedings.      The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.      The costs shall be borne equally by the parties.

Neither this Note or Agreement nor any other Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this section.      Lender may from time to time, (a) enter into with Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as Lender may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Note or Agreement or the Related Documents or any Event Default and its consequences, if, but only if, such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.

Re: Loan #28933 

The undersigned ("Guarantor") has executed a Commercial Guaranty dated September 15, 2006, in favor of Lender ("Guaranty").  Guarantor hereby acknowledges its consent to the terms and provisions of the foregoing Change in Terms Agreement/Note and/or Modification Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.  Guarantor hereby reaffirms its obligations to Lender under the Guaranty.  Guarantor hereby reaffirms that its obligations under the Guaranty to Lender are separate and distinct from Borrower's obligations to Lender.   

The section entitled   "SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINITION OF INDEBTEDNESS"   is hereby added under the section entitled   "Duration of Guaranty"   as follows: 

SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINITION OF INDEBTEDNESS.    In addition to the definition of      Indebtedness      stated above in this Guaranty, the word      Indebtedness      as used in this Guaranty shall also include Financial Contract (as defined herein) obligations.      "Financial Contract" means (1) an agreement (including terms and conditions incorporated by reference therein) which is a rate swap agreement, basis swap, forward rate agreement, commodity swap, commodity option, equity or equity index swap, bond option, interest rate option, foreign exchange agreement, rate cap agreement, rate floor agreement, rate collar agreement, currency swap agreement, cross-currency rate swap agreement, currency option, any other similar agreement (including any option to enter into any of the foregoing); or (2) any combination of the foregoing.      However, "Indebtedness" shall not include any Excluded Financial Contract Obligation (as defined herein).           Excluded Financial Contract Obligation      means, with respect to any Guarantor, any Financial Contract obligation if, and to the extent that, all or a portion of the Guaranty of such Guarantor of, or the grant by such Guarantor of a security interest to secure, such Financial Contract obligation (or any Guaranty thereof) is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the application or official interpretation of any thereof) by virtue of such Guarantor's failure for any reason to constitute an "eligible contract participant" as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder at the time the Guaranty of such Guarantor or the grant of such security interest becomes effective with respect to such Financial Contract obligation. If a Financial Contract obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one swap, such exclusion shall apply only to the portion of such Financial Contract Obligation that is attributable to swaps for which such Guaranty or security interest is or becomes illegal

Trustor presently assigns to Lender (also known as Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust) all of Trustor's right, title, and interest in and to all present and future leases of the Property and all Rents from the Property.  This is an absolute assignment of Rents made in connection with an obligation secured by real property pursuant to California Civil Code Section 2938.  In addition, Trustor grants to Lender a Uniform Commercial Code security interest in the Personal Property and Rents. 

THIS DEED OF TRUST, INCLUDING THE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND THE SECURITY INTEREST IN THE RENTS AND PERSONAL PROPERTY, IS GIVEN TO SECURE  (A)  PAYMENT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS AND  (B)  PERFORMANCE OF ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRUSTOR UNDER THE NOTE, THE RELATED DOCUMENTS, AND THIS DEED OF TRUST.  THIS DEED OF TRUST IS GIVEN AND ACCEPTED ON THE FOLLOWING TERMS: 

PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE.    Except as otherwise provided in this Deed of Trust, Trustor shall pay to Lender all amounts secured by this Deed of Trust as they become due, and shall strictly and in a timely manner perform all of Trustor's obligations under the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the Related Documents. 

POSSESSION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTY.    Trustor agrees that Trustor's possession and use of the Property shall be governed by the following provisions: 

Possession and Use.    Until the occurrence of an Event of Default, Trustor may  (1)  remain in possession and control of the Property;  (2)  use, operate or manage the Property; and  (3)  collect the Rents from the Property. 

Duty to Maintain.    Trustor shall maintain the Property in tenantable condition and promptly perform all repairs, replacements, and maintenance necessary to preserve its value. 

Compliance With Environmental Laws.    Trustor represents and warrants to Lender that:  (1)  During the period of Trustor's ownership of the Property, there has been no use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance by any person on, under, about or from the Property;  (2)  Trustor has no knowledge of, or reason to believe that there has been, except as previously disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing,  (a)  any breach or violation of any Environmental Laws,  (b)  any use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance on, under, about or from the Property by any prior owners or occupants of the Property, or  (c)  any actual or threatened litigation or claims of any kind by any person relating to such matters; and  (3)  Except as previously disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing,  (a)  neither Trustor nor any tenant, contractor, agent or other authorized user of the Property shall use, generate, manufacture, store, treat, dispose of or release any Hazardous Substance on, under, about or from the Property; and  (b)  any such activity shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including without limitation all Environmental Laws.  Trustor authorizes Lender and its agents to enter upon the Property to make such inspections and tests, at Trustor's expense, as Lender may deem appropriate to determine compliance of the Property with this section of the Deed of Trust.  Any inspections or tests made by Lender shall be for Lender's purposes only and shall not be construed to create any responsibility or liability on the part of Lender to Trustor or to any other person.  The representations and warranties contained herein are based on Trustor's due diligence in investigating the Property for Hazardous Substances.  Trustor hereby  (1)  releases and waives any future claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the event Trustor becomes liable for cleanup or other costs under any such laws; and  (2)  agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lender against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, and expenses which Lender may directly or indirectly sustain or suffer resulting from a breach of this section of the Deed of Trust or as a consequence of any use, generation, manufacture, storage, disposal, release or threatened release occurring prior to Trustor's ownership or interest in the Property, whether or not the same was or should have been known to Trustor.  The provisions of this section of the Deed of Trust, including the obligation to indemnify and defend, shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the satisfaction and reconveyance of the lien of this Deed of Trust and shall not be affected by Lender's acquisition of any interest in the Property, whether by foreclosure or otherwise. 

Nuisance, Waste.    Trustor shall not cause, conduct or permit any nuisance nor commit, permit, or suffer any stripping of or waste on or to the Property or any portion of the Property.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Trustor will not remove, or grant to any other party the right to remove, any timber, minerals (including oil and gas), coal, clay, scoria, soil, gravel or rock products without Lender's prior written consent. 

Removal of Improvements.    Trustor shall not demolish or remove any Improvements from the Real Property without Lender's prior written consent.  As a condition to the removal of any Improvements, Lender may require Trustor to make arrangements satisfactory to Lender to replace such Improvements with Improvements of at least equal value. 

Lender's Right to Enter.    Lender and Lender's agents and representatives may enter upon the Real Property at all reasonable times to attend to Lender's interests and to inspect the Real Property for purposes of Trustor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Deed of Trust. 

Compliance with Governmental Requirements.    Trustor shall promptly comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations, now or hereafter in effect, of all governmental authorities applicable to the use or occupancy of the Property, including without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act.  Trustor may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance, or regulation and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Trustor has notified Lender in writing prior to doing so and so long as, in Lender's sole opinion, Lender's interests in the Property are not jeopardized.  Lender may require Trustor to post adequate security or a surety bond, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, to protect Lender's interest. 

Duty to Protect.    Trustor agrees neither to abandon or leave unattended the Property.  Trustor shall do all other acts, in addition to those acts set forth above in this section, which from the character and use of the Property are reasonably necessary to protect and preserve the Property. 

DUE ON SALE - CONSENT BY LENDER.    Lender may, at Lender's option, declare immediately due and payable all sums secured by this Deed of Trust upon the sale or transfer, without Lender's prior written consent, of all or any part of the Real Property, or any interest in the Real Property.  A "sale or transfer" means the conveyance of Real Property or any right, title or interest in the Real Property; whether legal, beneficial or equitable; whether voluntary or involuntary; whether by outright sale, deed, installment sale contract, land contract, contract for deed, leasehold interest with a term greater than three (3) years, lease-option contract, or by sale, assignment, or transfer of any beneficial interest in or to any land trust holding title to the Real Property, or by any other method of conveyance of an interest in the Real Property.  If any Trustor is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, transfer also includes any change in ownership of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting stock, partnership interests or limited liability company interests, as the case may be, of such Trustor.  However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by applicable law. 

TAXES AND LIENS.    The following provisions relating to the taxes and liens on the Property are part of this Deed of Trust:   

Payment.    Trustor shall pay when due (and in all events at least ten (10) days prior to delinquency) all taxes, special taxes, assessments, charges (including water and sewer), fines and impositions levied against or on account of the Property, and shall pay when due all claims for work done on or for services rendered or material furnished to the Property.  Trustor shall maintain the Property free of all liens having priority over or equal to the interest of Lender under this Deed of Trust, except for the lien of taxes and assessments not due and except as otherwise provided in this Deed of Trust. 

Right to Contest.    Trustor may withhold payment of any tax, assessment, or claim in connection with a good faith dispute over the obligation to pay, so long as Lender's interest in the Property is not jeopardized.  If a lien arises or is filed as a result of nonpayment, Trustor shall within fifteen (15) days after the lien arises or, if a lien is filed, within fifteen (15) days after Trustor has notice of the filing, secure the discharge of the lien, or if requested by Lender, deposit with Lender cash or a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security satisfactory to Lender in an amount sufficient to discharge the lien plus any costs and attorneys' fees, or other charges that could accrue as a result of a foreclosure or sale under the lien.  In any contest, Trustor shall defend itself and Lender and shall satisfy any adverse judgment before enforcement against the Property.  Trustor shall name Lender as an additional obligee under any surety bond furnished in the contest proceedings. 

Evidence of Payment.    Trustor shall upon demand furnish to Lender satisfactory evidence of payment of the taxes or assessments and shall authorize the appropriate governmental official to deliver to Lender at any time a written statement of the taxes and assessments against the   

Property. 

Notice of Construction.    Trustor shall notify Lender at least fifteen (15) days before any work is commenced, any services are furnished, or any materials are supplied to the Property, if any mechanic's lien, materialmen's lien, or other lien could be asserted on account of the work, services, or materials and the cost exceeds $20,000.00.  Trustor will upon request of Lender furnish to Lender advance assurances satisfactory to Lender that Trustor can and will pay the cost of such improvements. 

PROPERTY DAMAGE INSURANCE.    The following provisions relating to insuring the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust. 

Maintenance of Insurance.    Trustor shall procure and maintain policies of fire insurance with standard extended coverage endorsements on a replacement basis for the full insurable value covering all Improvements on the Real Property in an amount sufficient to avoid application of any coinsurance clause, and with a standard mortgagee clause in favor of Lender.  Trustor shall also procure and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance in such coverage amounts as Lender may request with Trustee and Lender being named as additional insureds in such liability insurance policies.  Additionally, Trustor shall maintain such other insurance, including but not limited to hazard, business interruption, and boiler insurance, as Lender may reasonably require.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Trustor be required to provide hazard insurance in excess of the replacement value of the improvements on the Real Property.  Policies shall be written in form, amounts, coverages and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender.  Trustor, upon request of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lender.  Each insurance policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or default of Trustor or any other person.  Should the Real Property be located in an area designated by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a special flood hazard area, Trustor agrees to obtain and maintain Federal Flood Insurance, if available, within 45 days after notice is given by Lender that the Property is located in a special flood hazard area, for the full unpaid principal balance of the loan and any prior liens on the property securing the loan, up to the maximum policy limits set under the National Flood Insurance Program, or as otherwise required by Lender, and to maintain such insurance for the term of the loan. 

Application of Proceeds.    Trustor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Property if the estimated cost of repair or replacement exceeds $25,000.00.  Lender may make proof of loss if Trustor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty.  If in Lender's sole judgment Lender's security interest in the Property has been impaired, Lender may, at Lender's election, receive and retain the proceeds of any insurance and apply the proceeds to the reduction of the Indebtedness, payment of any lien affecting the Property, or the restoration and repair of the Property.  If the proceeds are to be applied to restoration and repair, Trustor shall repair or replace the damaged or destroyed Improvements in a manner satisfactory to Lender.  Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of such expenditure, pay or reimburse Trustor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration if Trustor is not in default under this Deed of Trust.  Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within 180 days after their receipt and which Lender has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Property shall be used first to pay any amount owing to Lender under this Deed of Trust, then to pay accrued interest, and the remainder, if any, shall be applied to the principal balance of the Indebtedness.  If Lender holds any proceeds after payment in full of the Indebtedness, such proceeds shall be paid to Trustor as Trustor's interests may appear. 

Trustor's Report on Insurance.    Upon request of Lender, however not more than once a year, Trustor shall furnish to Lender a report on each existing policy of insurance showing:  (1)  the name of the insurer;  (2)  the risks insured;  (3)  the amount of the policy;  (4)  the property insured, the then current replacement value of such property, and the manner of determining that value; and  (5)  the expiration date of the policy.  Trustor shall, upon request of Lender, have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine the cash value replacement cost of the Property. 

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.    If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Property or if Trustor fails to comply with any provision of this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Trustor's failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Trustor is required to discharge or pay under this Deed of Trust or any Related Documents, Lender on Trustor's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Property and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Property.  All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Trustor.  All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will  (A)  be payable on demand;  (B)  be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either  (1)  the term of any applicable insurance policy; or  (2)  the remaining term of the Note; or  (C)  be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity.  The Deed of Trust also will secure payment of these amounts.  Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. 

WARRANTY; DEFENSE OF TITLE.    The following provisions relating to ownership of the Property are a part of this Deed of Trust: 

Title.    Trustor warrants that:  (a) Trustor holds good and marketable title of record to the Property in fee simple, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances other than those set forth in the Real Property description or in any title insurance policy, title report, or final title opinion issued in favor of, and accepted by, Lender in connection with this Deed of Trust, and  (b) Trustor has the full right, power, and authority to execute and deliver this Deed of Trust to Lender. 

Defense of Title.    Subject to the exception in the paragraph above, Trustor warrants and will forever defend the title to the Property against the lawful claims of all persons.  In the event any action or proceeding is commenced that questions Trustor's title or the interest of Trustee or Lender under this Deed of Trust, Trustor shall defend the action at Trustor's expense.  Trustor may be the nominal party in such proceeding, but Lender shall be entitled to participate in the proceeding and to be represented in the proceeding by counsel of Lender's own choice, and Trustor will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender such instruments as Lender may request from time to time to permit such participation. 

Compliance With Laws.    Trustor warrants that the Property and Trustor's use of the Property complies with all existing applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of governmental authorities. 

Survival of Representations and Warranties.    All representations, warranties, and agreements made by Trustor in this Deed of Trust shall survive the execution and delivery of this Deed of Trust, shall be continuing in nature, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as Trustor's Indebtedness shall be paid in full. 

CONDEMNATION.    The following provisions relating to eminent domain and inverse condemnation proceedings are a part of this Deed of Trust: 

Proceedings.    If any eminent domain or inverse condemnation proceeding is commenced affecting the Property, Trustor shall promptly notify Lender in writing, and Trustor shall promptly take such steps as may be necessary to pursue or defend the action and obtain the award.  Trustor may be the nominal party in any such proceeding, but Lender shall be entitled, at its election, to participate in the proceeding and to be   

represented in the proceeding by counsel of its own choice, and Trustor will deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender such instruments and documentation as may be requested by Lender from time to time to permit such participation. 

Application of Net Proceeds.    If any award is made or settlement entered into in any condemnation proceedings affecting all or any part of the Property or by any proceeding or purchase in lieu of condemnation, Lender may at its election, and to the extent permitted by law, require that all or any portion of the award or settlement be applied to the Indebtedness and to the repayment of all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred by Trustee or Lender in connection with the condemnation proceedings. 

IMPOSITION OF TAXES, FEES AND CHARGES BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.    The following provisions relating to governmental taxes, fees and charges are a part of this Deed of Trust: 

Current Taxes, Fees and Charges.    Upon request by Lender, Trustor shall execute such documents in addition to this Deed of Trust and take whatever other action is requested by Lender to perfect and continue Lender's lien on the Real Property.  Trustor shall reimburse Lender for all taxes, as described below, together with all expenses incurred in recording, perfecting or continuing this Deed of Trust, including without limitation all taxes, fees, documentary stamps, and other charges for recording or registering this Deed of Trust. 

Taxes.    The following shall constitute taxes to which this section applies:  (1)  a specific tax upon this type of Deed of Trust or upon all or any part of the  Indebtedness secured by this Deed of Trust;  (2)  a specific tax on Trustor which Trustor is authorized or required to deduct from payments on the Indebtedness secured by this type of Deed of Trust;  (3)  a tax on this type of Deed of Trust chargeable against the Lender or the holder of the Note; and  (4)  a specific tax on all or any portion of the Indebtedness or on payments of principal and interest made by Trustor. 

Subsequent Taxes.    If any tax to which this section applies is enacted subsequent to the date of this Deed of Trust, this event shall have the same effect as an Event of Default, and Lender may exercise any or all of its available remedies for an Event of Default as provided below unless Trustor either  (1)  pays the tax before it becomes delinquent, or  (2)  contests the tax as provided above in the Taxes and Liens section and deposits with Lender cash or a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security satisfactory to Lender. 

SECURITY AGREEMENT; FINANCING STATEMENTS.    The following provisions relating to this Deed of Trust as a security agreement are a part of this Deed of Trust: 

Security Agreement.    This instrument shall constitute a Security Agreement to the extent any of the Property constitutes fixtures, and Lender shall have all of the rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as amended from time to time. 

Security Interest.    Upon request by Lender, Trustor shall take whatever action is requested by Lender to perfect and continue Lender's security interest in the Rents and Personal Property.  Trustor shall reimburse Lender for all expenses incurred in perfecting or continuing this security interest.  Upon default, Trustor shall not remove, sever or detach the Personal Property from the Property.  Upon default, Trustor shall assemble any Personal Property not affixed to the Property in a manner and at a place reasonably convenient to Trustor and Lender and make it available to Lender within three (3) days after receipt of written demand from Lender to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

Addresses.    The mailing addresses of Trustor (debtor) and Lender (secured party) from which information concerning the security interest granted by this Deed of Trust may be obtained (each as required by the Uniform Commercial Code) are as stated on the first page of this Deed of Trust. 

FURTHER ASSURANCES; ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.    The following provisions relating to further assurances and attorney-in-fact are a part of this Deed of Trust: 

Further Assurances.    At any time, and from time to time, upon request of Lender, Trustor will make, execute and deliver, or will cause to be made, executed or delivered, to Lender or to Lender's designee, and when requested by Lender, cause to be filed, recorded, refiled, or rerecorded, as the case may be, at such times and in such offices and places as Lender may deem appropriate, any and all such mortgages, deeds of trust, security deeds, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments of further assurance, certificates, and other documents as may, in the sole opinion of Lender, be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate, complete, perfect, continue, or preserve  (1)   Trustor's obligations under the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the Related Documents, and  (2)   the liens and security interests created by this Deed of Trust as first and prior liens on the Property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by Trustor.  Unless prohibited by law or Lender agrees to the contrary in writing, Trustor shall reimburse Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the matters referred to in this paragraph. 

Attorney-in-Fact.    If Trustor fails to do any of the things referred to in the preceding paragraph, Lender may do so for and in the name of Trustor and at Trustor's expense.  For such purposes, Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as Trustor's attorney-in-fact for the purpose of making, executing, delivering, filing, recording, and doing all other things as may be necessary or desirable, in Lender's sole opinion, to accomplish the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph. 

FULL PERFORMANCE.    If Trustor pays all the Indebtedness when due, and otherwise performs all the obligations imposed upon Trustor under this Deed of Trust, Lender shall execute and deliver to Trustee a request for full reconveyance and shall execute and deliver to Trustor suitable statements of termination of any financing statement on file evidencing Lender's security interest in the Rents and the Personal Property.  Lender may charge Trustor a reasonable reconveyance fee at the time of reconveyance. 

EVENTS OF DEFAULT.    Each of the following, at Lender's option, shall constitute an Event of Default under this Deed of Trust:

Other Defaults.

Default on Other Payments.    Failure of Trustor within the time required by this Deed of Trust to make any payment for taxes or insurance, or any other payment necessary to prevent filing of or to effect discharge of any lien. 

Default in Favor of Third Parties.    Should Grantor default under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Grantor's property or Grantor's ability to repay the Indebtedness or Grantor's ability to perform Grantor's obligations under this Deed of Trust or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements.    Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Trustor or on Trustor's behalf under this Deed   

of Trust or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Defective Collateralization.    This Deed of Trust or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Insolvency.    The dissolution or termination of Trustor's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Trustor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Trustor's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Trustor. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.    Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Trustor or by any governmental agency against any property securing the Indebtedness.  This includes a garnishment of any of Trustor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender.  However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Trustor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Trustor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Breach of Other Agreement.    Any breach by Trustor under the terms of any other agreement between Trustor and Lender that is not remedied within any grace period provided therein, including without limitation any agreement concerning any indebtedness or other obligation of Trustor to Lender, whether existing now or later. 

Events Affecting Guarantor.    Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse Change.    A material adverse change occurs in Trustor's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. 

Right to Cure.    If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Trustor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Deed of Trust within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Trustor, after Lender sends written notice to Trustor demanding cure of such default:  (1)  cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or  (2)  if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT.    If an Event of Default occurs under this Deed of Trust, at any time thereafter, Trustee or Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies: 

Election of Remedies.    Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Trustor under this Deed of Trust, after Trustor's failure to perform, shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and exercise its remedies. 

Foreclosure by Sale.    Upon an Event of Default under this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary may declare the entire Indebtedness secured by this Deed of Trust immediately due and payable by delivery to Trustee of written declaration of default and demand for sale and of written notice of default and of election to cause to be sold the Property, which notice Trustee shall cause to be filed for record.  Beneficiary also shall deposit with Trustee this Deed of Trust, the Note, other documents requested by Trustee, and all documents evidencing expenditures secured hereby.  After the lapse of such time as may then be required by law following the recordation of the notice of default, and notice of sale having been given as then required by law, Trustee, without demand on Trustor, shall sell the Property at the time and place fixed by it in the notice of sale, either as a whole or in separate parcels, and in such order as it may determine, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale.  Trustee may postpone sale of all or any portion of the Property by public announcement at such time and place of sale, and from time to time thereafter may postpone such sale by public announcement at the time fixed by the preceding postponement in accordance with applicable law.  Trustee shall deliver to such purchaser its deed conveying the Property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied.  The recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof.  Any person, including Trustor, Trustee or Beneficiary may purchase at such sale.  After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Trustee and of this Trust, including cost of evidence of title in connection with sale, Trustee shall apply the proceeds of sale to payment of:  all sums expended under the terms hereof, not then repaid, with accrued interest at the amount allowed by law in effect at the date hereof; all other sums then secured hereby; and the remainder, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. 

Judicial Foreclosure.    With respect to all or any part of the Real Property, Lender shall have the right in lieu of foreclosure by power of sale to foreclose by judicial foreclosure in accordance with and to the full extent provided by California law. 

UCC Remedies.    With respect to all or any part of the Personal Property, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, including without limitation the right to recover any deficiency in the manner and to the full extent provided by California law. 

Collect Rents.    Lender shall have the right, without notice to Trustor to take possession of and manage the Property and collect the Rents, including amounts past due and unpaid, and apply the net proceeds, over and above Lender's costs, against the Indebtedness.  In furtherance of this right, Lender may require any tenant or other user of the Property to make payments of rent or use fees directly to Lender.  If the Rents are collected by Lender, then Trustor irrevocably designates Lender as Trustor's attorney-in-fact to endorse instruments received in payment thereof in the name of Trustor and to negotiate the same and collect the proceeds.  Payments by tenants or other users to Lender in response to Lender's demand shall satisfy the obligations for which the payments are made, whether or not any proper grounds for the demand existed.  Lender may exercise its rights under this subparagraph either in person, by agent, or through a receiver. 

Appoint Receiver.    Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Property, with the power to protect and preserve the Property, to operate the Property preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the Rents from the Property and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness.  The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law.  Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Property exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount.  Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver. 

Tenancy at Sufferance.    If Trustor remains in possession of the Property after the Property is sold as provided above or Lender otherwise becomes entitled to possession of the Property upon default of Trustor, Trustor shall become a tenant at sufferance of Lender or the purchaser of the Property and shall, at Lender's option, either  (1)  pay a reasonable rental for the use of the Property, or  (2)  vacate the Property immediately upon the demand of Lender.   

Other Remedies.    Trustee or Lender shall have any other right or remedy provided in this Deed of Trust or the Note or available at law or in equity. 

Notice of Sale.    Lender shall give Trustor reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale of the Personal Property or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition of the Personal Property is to be made.  Reasonable notice shall mean notice given at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition.  Any sale of the Personal Property may be made in conjunction with any sale of the Real Property. 

Sale of the Property.    To the extent permitted by applicable law, Trustor hereby waives any and all rights to have the Property marshalled.  In exercising its rights and remedies, the Trustee or Lender shall be free to sell all or any part of the Property together or separately, in one sale or by separate sales.  Lender shall be entitled to bid at any public sale on all or any portion of the Property. 

Attorneys' Fees; Expenses.    If Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Deed of Trust, Lender shall be entitled to recover such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorneys' fees at trial and upon any appeal.  Whether or not any court action is involved, and to the extent not prohibited by law, all reasonable expenses Lender incurs that in Lender's opinion are necessary at any time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of the expenditure until repaid.  Expenses covered by this paragraph include, without limitation, however subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees and expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services, the cost of searching records, obtaining title reports (including foreclosure reports), surveyors' reports, and appraisal fees, title insurance, and fees for the Trustee, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Trustor also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law. 

Rights of Trustee.    Trustee shall have all of the rights and duties of Lender as set forth in this section.

The instrument shall contain, in addition to all other matters required by state law, the names of the original Lender, Trustee, and Trustor, the book and page where this Deed of Trust is recorded, and the name and address of the successor trustee, and the instrument shall be executed and acknowledged by Lender or its successors in interest.

Any party may change its address for notices under this Deed of Trust by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party's address.  For notice purposes, Trustor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Trustor's current address.  Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Trustor, any notice given by Lender to any Trustor is deemed to be notice given to all Trustors. 

STATEMENT OF OBLIGATION FEE.    Lender may collect a fee, not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by law, for furnishing the statement of obligation as provided by Section 2943 of the Civil Code of California.  

JUDICIAL REFERENCE.   If the waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, who shall be a retired state or federal court judge, mutually selected by the parties or, if they cannot agree, then any party may seek to have a private judge appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure        638 and 640 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts). The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure        638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers.      All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure       644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph. 

The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the referenced proceedings.      The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.      The costs shall be borne equally by the parties. 

CHOICE OF VENUE.   If there is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Los Angeles County, State of California. 

ORAL AGREEMENTS NOT EFFECTIVE.   This Note or Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.      Moreover, any subsequent oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings of the parties shall not be effective against Lender unless (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.

Neither this Note or Agreement nor any other Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this section.      Lender may from time to time, (a) enter into with Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as Lender may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Note or Agreement or the Related Documents or any Event Default and its consequences, if, but only if, such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.      Then such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and specific purpose for which given.

No Waiver by Lender.    Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Deed of Trust unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender.  No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right.  A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Deed of Trust shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender's right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Deed of Trust.

If the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Deed of Trust.

PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE.

Unless and until Lender exercises its right to collect the Rents as provided below and so long as there is no default under this Assignment, Grantor may remain in possession and control of and operate and manage the Property and collect the Rents, provided that the granting of the right to collect the Rents shall not constitute Lender's consent to the use of cash collateral in a bankruptcy proceeding. 

GRANTOR'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.    Grantor warrants that: 

Ownership.    Grantor is entitled to receive the Rents free and clear of all rights, loans, liens, encumbrances, and claims except as disclosed to and accepted by Lender in writing. 

Right to Assign.    Grantor has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Assignment and to assign and convey the Rents to Lender. 

No Prior Assignment.    Grantor has not previously assigned or conveyed the Rents to any other person by any instrument now in force. 

No Further Transfer.    Grantor will not sell, assign, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any of Grantor's rights in the Rents except as provided   

in this Assignment. 

LENDER'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND COLLECT RENTS.    Lender shall have the right at any time, and even though no default shall have occurred under this Assignment, to collect and receive the Rents.  For this purpose, Lender is hereby given and granted the following rights, powers and authority: 

Notice to Tenants.    Lender may send notices to any and all tenants of the Property advising them of this Assignment and directing all Rents to be paid directly to Lender or Lender's agent. 

Enter the Property.    Lender may enter upon and take possession of the Property; demand, collect and receive from the tenants or from any other persons liable therefor, all of the Rents; institute and carry on all legal proceedings necessary for the protection of the Property, including such proceedings as may be necessary to recover possession of the Property; collect the Rents and remove any tenant or tenants or other persons from the Property. 

Maintain the Property.    Lender may enter upon the Property to maintain the Property and keep the same in repair; to pay the costs thereof and of all services of all employees, including their equipment, and of all continuing costs and expenses of maintaining the Property in proper repair and condition, and also to pay all taxes, assessments and water utilities, and the premiums on fire and other insurance effected by Lender on the Property. 

Compliance with Laws.    Lender may do any and all things to execute and comply with the laws of the State of California and also all other laws, rules, orders, ordinances and requirements of all other governmental agencies affecting the Property. 

Lease the Property.    Lender may rent or lease the whole or any part of the Property for such term or terms and on such conditions as Lender may deem appropriate. 

Employ Agents.    Lender may engage such agent or agents as Lender may deem appropriate, either in Lender's name or in Grantor's name, to rent and manage the Property, including the collection and application of Rents. 

Other Acts.    Lender may do all such other things and acts with respect to the Property as Lender may deem appropriate and may act exclusively and solely in the place and stead of Grantor and to have all of the powers of Grantor for the purposes stated above. 

No Requirement to Act.    Lender shall not be required to do any of the foregoing acts or things, and the fact that Lender shall have performed one or more of the foregoing acts or things shall not require Lender to do any other specific act or thing. 

APPLICATION OF RENTS.    All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the Property shall be for Grantor's account and Lender may pay such costs and expenses from the Rents.  Lender, in its sole discretion, shall determine the application of any and all Rents received by it; however, any such Rents received by Lender which are not applied to such costs and expenses shall be applied to the Indebtedness.  All expenditures made by Lender under this Assignment and not reimbursed from the Rents shall become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Assignment, and shall be payable on demand, with interest at the Note rate from date of expenditure until paid. 

FULL PERFORMANCE.    If Grantor pays all of the Indebtedness when due and otherwise performs all the obligations imposed upon Grantor under this Assignment, the Note, and the Related Documents, Lender shall execute and deliver to Grantor a suitable satisfaction of this Assignment and suitable statements of termination of any financing statement on file evidencing Lender's security interest in the Rents and the Property.  Any termination fee required by law shall be paid by Grantor, if permitted by applicable law. 

LENDER'S EXPENDITURES.    If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender's interest in the Property or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Assignment or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor's failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Assignment or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor's behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Rents or the Property and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Property.  All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor.  All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender's option, will  (A)  be payable on demand;  (B)  be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either  (1)  the term of any applicable insurance policy; or  (2)  the remaining term of the Note; or  (C)  be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note's maturity.  The Assignment also will secure payment of these amounts.  Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. 

DEFAULT.    Each of the following, at Lender's option, shall constitute an Event of Default under this Assignment: 

Payment Default.    Grantor fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. 

Other Defaults.    Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Assignment or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Grantor. 

Default on Other Payments.    Failure of Grantor within the time required by this Assignment to make any payment for taxes or insurance, or any other payment necessary to prevent filing of or to effect discharge of any lien. 

Default in Favor of Third Parties.    Any guarantor or Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of any guarantor's or Grantor's property or ability to perform their respective obligations under this Assignment or any of the Related Documents. 

False Statements.    Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor's behalf under this Assignment or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Defective Collateralization.    This Assignment or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Insolvency.    The dissolution or termination of Grantor's existence as a going business, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Grantor's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor. 

Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.    Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against the Rents or any property securing the   

Indebtedness.  This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor's accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender.  However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Property Damage or Loss.    The Property is lost, stolen, substantially damaged, sold, or borrowed against. 

Events Affecting Guarantor.    Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse Change.    A material adverse change occurs in Grantor's financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. 

Cure Provisions.    If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Assignment within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after Lender sends written notice to Grantor demanding cure of such default:  (1)  cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or  (2)  if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT.    Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any time thereafter, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies, in addition to any other rights or remedies provided by law: 

Accelerate Indebtedness.    Lender shall have the right at its option without notice to Grantor to declare the entire Indebtedness immediately due and payable, including any prepayment fee that Grantor would be required to pay. 

Collect Rents.    Lender shall have the right, without notice to Grantor, to take possession of the Property and collect the Rents, including amounts past due and unpaid, and apply the net proceeds, over and above Lender's costs, against the Indebtedness.  In furtherance of this right, Lender shall have all the rights provided for in the Lender's Right to Receive and Collect Rents Section, above.  If the Rents are collected by Lender, then Grantor irrevocably designates Lender as Grantor's attorney-in-fact to endorse instruments received in payment thereof in the name of Grantor and to negotiate the same and collect the proceeds.  Payments by tenants or other users to Lender in response to Lender's demand shall satisfy the obligations for which the payments are made, whether or not any proper grounds for the demand existed.  Lender may exercise its rights under this subparagraph either in person, by agent, or through a receiver. 

Appoint Receiver.    Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Property, with the power to protect and preserve the Property, to operate the Property preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the Rents from the Property and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness.  The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law.  Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Property exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount.  Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver. 

Other Remedies.    Lender shall have all other rights and remedies provided in this Assignment or the Note or by law. 

Election of Remedies.    Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Assignment, after Grantor's failure to perform, shall not affect Lender's right to declare a default and exercise its remedies. 

Attorneys' Fees; Expenses.    If Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Assignment, Lender shall be entitled to recover such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorneys' fees at trial and upon any appeal.  Whether or not any court action is involved, and to the extent not prohibited by law, all reasonable expenses Lender incurs that in Lender's opinion are necessary at any time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of the expenditure until repaid.  Expenses covered by this paragraph include, without limitation, however subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees and expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services, the cost of searching records, obtaining title reports (including foreclosure reports), surveyors' reports, and appraisal fees, title insurance, and fees for the Trustee, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Grantor also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law. 

JUDICIAL REFERENCE.   If the waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, who shall be a retired state or federal court judge, mutually selected by the parties or, if they cannot agree, then any party may seek to have a private judge appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure        638 and 640 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts). The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure        638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers.      All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure       644(a). Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph. 

The parties agree that time is of the essence in conducting the referenced proceedings.      The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.      The costs shall be borne equally by the parties. 

CHOICE OF VENUE.   If there is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Los Angeles County, State of California. 

ORAL AGREEMENTS NOT EFFECTIVE.   This Note or Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.      Moreover, any subsequent oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings of the parties shall not be effective against Lender unless (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.      Borrower shall not rely or act on any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties at anytime whatsoever, including before or during any Lender approval process stated above.      Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower shall be responsible for its own actions, including any detrimental reliance on any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties and that Lender shall not be liable for any possible claims, counterclaims, demands, actions, causes of action, damages, costs, expenses and liability whatsoever, known or unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, suspected or unsuspected, at law or in equity, originating in whole or in part in connection with any oral statements, negotiations, agreements or understandings between the parties which the Borrower may now or hereafter claim against the Lender.      Neither this Note or Agreement nor any other Related Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this section.      Lender may from time to time, (a) enter into with Borrower written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the Related Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as Lender may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Note or Agreement or the Related Documents or any Event Default and its consequences, if, but only if, such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is (i) expressly stated in writing, (ii) duly approved and authorized by an appropriate decision making committee of Lender on such terms and conditions as such committee shall deem necessary or appropriate in the committee     s sole and absolute opinion and judgment and (iii) executed by an authorized officer of Lender.      Then such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and specific purpose for which given.

(3)   The names given to paragraphs or sections in this Assignment are for convenience purposes only. They are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions of this Assignment. 

No Waiver by Lender.    Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Assignment unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender.  No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right.  A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Assignment shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender's right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Assignment.

For notice purposes, Grantor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Grantor's current address.  Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Grantor, any notice given by Lender to any Grantor is deemed to be notice given to all Grantors. 

Powers of Attorney.    The various agencies and powers of attorney conveyed on Lender under this Assignment are granted for purposes of security and may not be revoked by Grantor until such time as the same are renounced by Lender. 

Severability.    If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Assignment to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance.  If feasible, the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable.  If the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Assignment.  Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of any provision of this Assignment shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Assignment. 

Successors and Assigns.    Subject to any limitations stated in this Assignment on transfer of Grantor's interest, this Assignment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.

AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE INSURANCE 

INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.    Grantor, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Grantor"), understands that insurance coverage is required in connection with the extending of a loan or the providing of other financial accommodations to Grantor by Lender.  These requirements are set forth in the security documents for the loan.  The following minimum insurance coverages must be provided on the following described collateral (the "Collateral"):   

Type:    Fire and extended coverage. 

Amount:    Full Insurable Value; however in no event greater than the value of the replacement cost of the improvements. 

Basis:    Replacement value. 

Endorsements:    Standard mortgagee's clause with stipulation that coverage will not be cancelled or diminished without a minimum of 30 days prior written notice to Lender, and without disclaimer of the insurer's liability for failure to give such notice. 

Comments:    Lender's Loss Payable Endorsement to read:  East West Bank, its successors and/or assigns, at P.O. Box 60021, City of Industry, CA 91716-0021. 

Deductible  . Not to exceed $50,000.00 

Loan No. as indicated on your Note to be listed on the Policy 

Hazardous Insurance Disclosure  .  Lender has advised us that it is not permitted under California law to require a borrower, as a condition of receiving or maintaining a loan secured by real property, to provide hazard insurance coverage against risks to the improvements on that real property (such as fire and other peril) in an amount exceeding the replacement value of the improvements on the property. 

Latest Delivery Date:    By the loan closing date. 

INSURANCE COMPANY.    Grantor may obtain insurance from any insurance company Grantor may choose that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.  Grantor understands that credit may not be denied solely because insurance was not purchased through Lender. 

FLOOD INSURANCE.    Flood Insurance for the Collateral securing this loan is described as follows:   

Real Estate at 11480 Sixth Street, Rancho Cucamonga, CA  91730. 

The Collateral securing this loan is not currently located in an area identified as having special flood hazards.  Therefore, no special flood hazard insurance is necessary at this time.  Should the Collateral at any time be deemed to be located in an area designated by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a special flood hazard area, Grantor agrees to obtain and maintain Federal Flood Insurance, if available, within 45 days after notice is given by Lender that the Collateral is located in a special flood hazard area, for the full unpaid principal balance of the loan and any prior liens on the property securing the loan, up to the maximum policy limits set under the National Flood Insurance Program, or as otherwise required by Lender, and to maintain such insurance for the term of the loan.  Flood insurance may be purchased under the National Flood Insurance Program or from private insurers. 

INSURANCE MAILING ADDRESS.    All documents and other materials relating to insurance for this loan should be mailed, delivered or directed to the following address:   

East West Bank 

Loan Service Department - Insurance 

P.O. Box 60021 

City of Industry, CA  91716-0021 

FAILURE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE.    Grantor agrees to deliver to Lender, on the latest delivery date stated above, evidence of the required insurance as provided above, with an effective date of September 8, 2016, or earlier.  Grantor acknowledges and agrees that if Grantor fails to provide any required insurance or fails to continue such insurance in force, Lender may do so at Grantor's expense as provided in the applicable security document.  The cost of any such insurance, at the option of Lender, shall be added to the indebtedness as provided in the security document.  GRANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IF LENDER SO PURCHASES ANY SUCH INSURANCE, THE INSURANCE WILL PROVIDE LIMITED PROTECTION AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE COLLATERAL, UP TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LESSER OF (1) THE UNPAID BALANCE OF THE DEBT, EXCLUDING ANY UNEARNED FINANCE CHARGES, OR (2) THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL; HOWEVER, GRANTOR'S EQUITY IN THE COLLATERAL MAY NOT BE INSURED.  IN ADDITION, THE INSURANCE MAY NOT PROVIDE ANY PUBLIC LIABILITY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE INDEMNIFICATION AND MAY NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS. 

AUTHORIZATION.    For purposes of insurance coverage on the Collateral, Grantor authorizes Lender to provide to any person (including any insurance agent or company) all information Lender deems appropriate, whether regarding the Collateral, the loan or other financial accommodations, or both.   

GRANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES HAVING READ ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE INSURANCE AND AGREES TO ITS TERMS.  THIS AGREEMENT IS DATED SEPTEMBER 8, 2016.
