  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1: Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by PerkinElmer, Inc. (the  Company ), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the  U.S.  or the "United States") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information in the footnote disclosures of the financial statements has been condensed or omitted where it substantially duplicates information provided in the Company s latest audited consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016  , filed with the SEC (the    2015   Form 10-K ). The balance sheet amounts at   January 3, 2016   in this report were derived from the Company s audited   2015   consolidated financial statements included in the   2015   Form 10-K. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year or any future period.  
    
  The Company s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending   January 1, 2017   ("  fiscal year 2016  ") will include   52   weeks, while the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   ("  fiscal year 2015  ") included   53   weeks. The additional week in fiscal year 2015 was reflected in the Company's third quarter, which consisted of   14   weeks as compared to the Company's third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which consisted of   13   weeks. 
    
  Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements:   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to the Company s operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230 and other topics. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, and if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, ASU 2016-15 allows the amendments for those issues to be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard requires entities to use the expected loss impairment model and will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Entities are required to estimate the lifetime  expected credit loss  for each applicable financial asset and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an AFS debt security is a credit loss. An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on an AFS debt security as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU No. 2016-09"). The new standard simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and such tax benefits and tax deficiencies are not included in the estimate of an entity s annual effective tax rate, applied on a prospective basis. Further, the standard eliminates the requirement to defer the recognition of excess tax benefits until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. All excess tax benefits previously unrecognized, along with any valuation allowance, should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under ASU No. 2016-09, an entity that applies the treasury stock method in calculating diluted earnings per share is required to exclude excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of assumed proceeds since such amounts are recognized in the income statement. Excess tax benefits should also be classified as operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes on the statement of cash flows, as such excess tax benefits no longer represent financing activities since they are recognized in the income statement, and should be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The Company recorded a cumulative increase of   $14.2 million   in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 retained earnings with a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets related to the prior years' unrecognized excess tax benefits. Excess tax benefits related to exercised options and vested restricted stock and restricted stock units during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   have been recognized in the current period s income statement. The Company also excluded the excess tax benefits from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  . The Company applied the cash flow presentation section of the guidance on a prospective basis, and the prior period statement of cash flows was not adjusted. ASU No. 2016-09 also allows an entity to elect as an accounting policy either to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered or to account for forfeitures for service based awards as they occur. An entity that elects to account for forfeitures as they occur should apply the accounting change on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of this accounting policy did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for financing and operating leases. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . Under this new guidance, companies that use inventory measurement methods other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"). Under this new guidance, an entity should use a five-step process to recognize revenue, depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequent to the issuance of the standard, the FASB decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12")  ,   which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In April 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

Performance Obligations and Licensing   ("ASU 2016-10")  ,   which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of the contract, clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable (i.e., distinct within the context of the contract) and allow an entity to elect to account for the cost of shipping and handling performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost (i.e., an expense). ASU 2016-10 also clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property ("IP") and requires entities to classify IP in one of two categories: functional IP or symbolic IP, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. ASU 2016-10 also address how entities should consider license renewals and restrictions and apply the exception for sales- and usage-based royalties received in exchange for licenses of IP.  ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the requirements of the foregoing standards and has not yet determined the impact of their adoption on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company intends to adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach, and the Company does not intend to early adopt these standards. 

Note 2: Business Combinations 
  Acquisitions in fiscal year 2016 
  During the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses for a total consideration of   $72.4 million   in cash.  The acquired businesses included Bioo Scientific Corporation, which was acquired for total consideration of   $63.6 million   in cash and one other business acquired for a total consideration of   $8.8 million   in cash. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill of   $45.8 million  , which is not tax deductible, and intangible assets of   $19.9 million  . The Company has reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of the Company's Human Health and Environmental Health segments from the acquisition dates. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had weighted average amortization periods of   9.5 years  .  
    
  The total purchase price for the acquisitions in   fiscal year 2016   has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: 

Acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 
  During fiscal year 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of five businesses for a total consideration of   $77.1 million   in cash. The acquired businesses included Vanadis Diagnostics AB ( Vanadis ), which was acquired for total consideration of   $35.1 million   in cash, as further described in Note 17 below, and other acquisitions for aggregate consideration  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

of   $42.0 million   in cash. The Company has a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of Vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to   $93.0 million  , which at closing had an estimated fair value of   $56.9 million  . The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, of which   $9.2 million   is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of the Company s Human Health and Environmental Health segments from the acquisition dates. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology and trade names, acquired as part of these acquisitions had weighted average amortization periods of   nine years  . 
    
  The total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: 

The preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions are based upon initial valuations. The Company's estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete its valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to   one year   from the respective acquisition dates. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. During the measurement periods, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. These adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings. 
  Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition

     Table of Contents  

date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds, changes in discount rates or product development milestones during the earnout period. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to   $94.6 million  . As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company has recorded contingent consideration obligations with an estimated fair value of   $66.9 million  , of which   $10.2 million   was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and   $56.7 million   was recorded in long-term liabilities. As of   January 3, 2016  , the Company had recorded contingent consideration obligations with an estimated fair value of   $57.4 million  , of which   $9.4 million   was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and   $48.0 million   was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed   five years   from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at   October 2, 2016   was   two years  . If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. 
  Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   were   $0.4 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities for the   three and nine   months ended   October 4, 2015   were   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Note 3: Disposition of Businesses and Assets 
    
  As part of the Company s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses.  When the discontinued operations represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial statements,  the Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-08,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of An Entity,   continues to be reported as a discontinued operation, and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  .

  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed the sale of its investment in PerkinElmer Labs, Inc., recognizing a pre-tax gain of   $7.1 million  . The sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of   $7.3 million  , which resulted in an income tax benefit of   $2.5 million   that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016. PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. was a component of the Company's Human Health segment. The pre-tax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Note 7: Income Taxes 
    
  The Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company makes adjustments to its unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. 
  At   October 2, 2016  , the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of   $27.6 million  , of which   $25.9 million  , if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect discontinued operations. 
  The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately   $2.6 million   of its uncertain tax positions at   October 2, 2016  , including accrued interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits, may be resolved over the next twelve months as a result of lapses in applicable statutes of limitations and potential settlements. Various tax years after   2009   remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. 
  During the first   nine   months of   fiscal years 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded net discrete income tax   benefit  s of   $7.1 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively. The discrete tax benefit in the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016   includes the tax benefits from the sale of a subsidiary amounting to   $2.5 million  . 

Note 8: Debt 
    
  Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.    On August 11, 2016, the Company terminated its previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five year term and an expansion of borrowing capacity from   $700.0 million   to   $1.0 billion  . The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for   $1.0 billion   of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of   August 11, 2021  . As of   October 2, 2016  , undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of   $11.4 million   were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $935.6 million   available for additional borrowing under the facility. The Company uses the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate at the time of borrowing, plus a margin. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) an adjusted one-month Libor plus 1.00%. At   October 2, 2016  , borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were accruing interest primarily based on the Eurocurrency rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of   October 2, 2016   was   110   basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of   October 2, 2016   was   0.56%  , resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of   1.66%  . As of   October 2, 2016  , the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of   $48.5 million  , which was net of   $4.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of   January 3, 2016  , the previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of   $479.6 million  , which was net of   $2.4 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as the Company's debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that the Company's debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. 
  5%   Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2021.   On October 25, 2011, the Company issued   $500.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 (the  2021 Notes ) in a registered public offering and received   $496.9 million   of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at   99.372%   of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of   $3.1 million  . As of   October 2, 2016  , the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $495.7 million  , net of   $1.8 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $2.6 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs.

The 2021 Notes mature in   November 2021   and bear interest at an annual rate of   5%  . Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2021 Notes, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for   101%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  1.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026.

The 2026 Notes were issued at   99.118%   of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of    4.4 million  . The 2026 Notes mature in   July 2026   and bear interest at an annual rate of   1.875%  . Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable annually on July 19th each year.  The proceeds from the 2026 Notes were used to pay in full the outstanding balance of the Company's previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  As of   October 2, 2016  , the 2026 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $551.6 million  , net of   $4.9 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $4.9 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
   Prior to April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2026 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2026 Notes being redeemed, discounted on an annual basis, at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) plus 35 basis points; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time on or after April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem the 2026 Notes, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes due to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2026 Notes below investment grade, the Company will, in certain circumstances, make an offer to purchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to   101%   of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
  Financing Lease Obligations.   In fiscal year 2012, the Company entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that the Company is currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. The Company provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result the Company was considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, the Company was not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. The Company is therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for the Company and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, the Company capitalized   $29.3 million   in property, plant and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. The Company has also capitalized   $11.5 million   in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. At   October 2, 2016  , the Company had   $37.4 million   recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which   $1.2 million   was recorded as short-term debt and   $36.2 million   was recorded as long-term debt. At   January 3, 2016  , the Company had   $38.2 million   recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which   $1.1 million   was recorded as short-term debt and   $37.1 million   was recorded as long-term debt. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other.

Note 9: Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations: 

Antidilutive securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Note 13: Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net 
    
  The Company tests goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. Accordingly, the Company completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or non-amortizing intangible assets. 
  The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company performed its annual impairment testing  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

for its reporting units as of   January 4, 2016  , its annual impairment date for   fiscal year 2016  . The Company concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than   20.0%   for each reporting unit. The long-term terminal growth rate for the Company s reporting units was   3.0%   for the   fiscal year 2016   impairment analysis. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was   9.5%   to   12.5%  . Keeping all other variables constant, a   10.0%   change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units would still allow the Company to conclude, based on the first step of the process, that there was no impairment of goodwill. 
  The Company has consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years  cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with the Company s historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect the long-term terminal growth rates of the Company. The Company corroborates the income approach with a market approach. 
  The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized  .   In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The Company performed its annual impairment testing as of   January 4, 2016  , and concluded that there was no impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. An assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. No such events occurred during the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  . 
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   were as follows:

Identifiable intangible asset balances at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   by category were as follows: 

Total amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets was   $17.3 million   and   $55.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $18.8 million   and   $58.5 million   for the   three and nine   months   October 4, 2015  , respectively. Estimated amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years is   $17.4 million   for the remainder of fiscal year   2016  ,   $65.7 million   for fiscal year   2017  ,   $63.7 million   for fiscal year   2018  ,   $51.5 million   for fiscal year   2019  , and   $42.3 million   for fiscal year   2020  . 

Note 14: Warranty Reserves 
    
  The Company provides warranty protection for certain products usually for a period of one year beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time for service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by management s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Note 15: Employee Postretirement Benefit Plans 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of net periodic credit for the Company s various defined benefit employee pension and postretirement plans for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  : 

During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , the Company contributed   $7.6 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States. During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company did not make contributions to its defined benefit pension plan in the United States. During the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , the Company contributed   $20.0 million   to its defined benefit pension plan in the United States. 
  The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses, unless an interim remeasurement is required, in operating results in the fourth quarter of the year in which the gains and losses occur, in accordance with the Company's accounting method for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits as described in Note 1 of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in its   2015   Form 10-K. Such adjustments for gains and losses are primarily driven by events and  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

circumstances beyond the Company's control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. 

Note 16: Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately   60%   of the Company s business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed   12   months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on the Company s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within the Company s condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  
    
  Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar. The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling   $128.5 million  ,   $127.3 million   and   $104.7 million   at   October 2, 2016  ,   January 3, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally   30   days or less during each of the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . 
    
  In addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Company records these hedges at fair value on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within the Company s condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined Euro notional amounts of    50.7 million   and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of   $9.2 million  . The combined Euro notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was    107.4 million   and    108.7 million   as of   January 3, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . The Company paid   $0.1 million   and received   $19.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, from the settlement of these hedges. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of    492.3 million   to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), as well as to offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. The foreign currency forward contracts were settled during the third quarter of 2016 and the Company recorded a net realized foreign exchange gain in AOCI amounting to   $1.8 million   during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company designated the 2026 Notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as to offset translation adjustments on the underlying  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of   October 2, 2016  , the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was    495.7 million  . The unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge was   $10.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  .  
    
  The Company does   no  t expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months. 

Note 17: Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  . The Company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company s currency risk, and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value. 
  Valuation Hierarchy:   The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset s or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. 
  The following tables show the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   classified in one of the three classifications described above: 

24 

     Table of Contents  

Level 1 and Level 2 Valuation Techniques:        The Company s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities. 
  Marketable securities:      Include equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using the quoted market prices in active markets at the reporting date. 
  Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities:      Include foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. The Company s foreign exchange derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled under these arrangements have been presented in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet on a net basis and are recorded in other assets. As of both   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , none of the master netting arrangements involved collateral. 
  Level 3 Valuation Techniques:        The Company s Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration related to acquisitions. For liabilities that utilize Level 3 inputs, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 3 liabilities. 
  Contingent consideration:      Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date using projected milestone dates, discount rates, probabilities of success and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected risk-adjusted contingent payments are discounted back to the current period using a discounted cash flow model. 
  During fiscal year 2015, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from Vanadis. Under the terms of the acquisition, the initial purchase consideration was   $32.0 million  , net of cash and the Company will be obligated to make potential future milestone payments, based on completion of a proof of concept, regulatory approvals and product sales, of up to   $93.0 million   ranging from 2016 to 2019. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated at   $56.9 million  . During the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  , the Company updated the fair value of the contingent consideration and recorded a liability of   $66.7 million   as of   October 2, 2016  . The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration as of   October 2, 2016   included projected milestone dates of   2016   to   2019  , discount rates ranging from   2.0%   to   9.6%  , conditional probabilities of success of each individual milestone ranging from   85%   to   100%   and cumulative probabilities of success for each individual milestone ranging from   59%   to   100%  . A significant delay in the product development (including projected regulatory milestone) achievement date in isolation could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement; a significant acceleration in the product development (including projected regulatory milestone) achievement date in isolation would not have a material impact on the fair value measurement; a significant change in the discount rate in isolation would not have a material impact on the fair value measurement; and a significant change in the probabilities of success in isolation could result in a significant change in fair value measurement. 
  The fair values of contingent consideration are calculated on a quarterly basis based on a collaborative effort of the Company s regulatory, research and development, operations, finance and accounting groups, as appropriate. Potential valuation adjustments are made as additional information becomes available, including the progress towards completion of a proof of concept, regulatory approvals and product sales as compared to initial projections, the impact of market competition and market landscape shifts from non-invasive prenatal testing products, with the impact of such adjustments being recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to   $94.6 million  . The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed   five years   from the respective acquisition dates, and the remaining weighted average earnout period at   October 2, 2016   was   two years  . 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows: 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. If measured at fair value, cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company s new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides for   $1.0 billion   of revolving loans, had borrowings outstanding of   $53.0 million  , which excluded   $4.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs and letters of credit. As of   January 3, 2016  , the Company's previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had   $482.0 million   of borrowings outstanding, which excluded   $2.4 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs and letters of credit. The interest rate on the Company s new senior unsecured revolving credit facility is reset at least monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The Company had no change in credit standing during the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  . Consequently, the borrowing value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value and would be classified as Level 2. 
  The Company's 2021 Notes, with a face value of   $500.0 million  , had an aggregate carrying value of   $495.7 million  , net of   $1.8 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $2.6 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs as of   October 2, 2016  . The 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $495.1 million  , net of   $2.0 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $2.9 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs as of   January 3, 2016  . The 2021 Notes had a fair value of   $552.2 million   and   $518.9 million   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively. The fair value of the 2021 Notes is estimated using market quotes from brokers and is based on current rates offered for similar debt. 
  The Company's 2026 Notes, with a face value of    500 million  , had an aggregate carrying value of   $551.6 million  , net of   $4.9 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $4.9 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs as of   October 2, 2016  . The 2026 Notes had a fair value of    523.7 million   as of   October 2, 2016  . The fair value of the 2026 Notes is estimated using market quotes from brokers and is based on current rates offered for similar debt. 
  The Company's financing lease obligations had an aggregate carrying value of   $37.4 million   and   $38.2 million   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively. The carrying values of the Company's financing lease obligations approximated their fair value as there has been minimal change in the Company's incremental borrowing rate. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the 2021 Notes, 2026 Notes and financing lease obligations were classified as Level 2. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company s derivative liabilities due to credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to the Company s derivative assets based on the evaluation of its counterparties  credit risks. 

Note 18: Contingencies 
    
  The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued   $10.3 million   and   $11.8 million   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively, which represents its management s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. These amounts were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The Company's environmental accrual is not discounted  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to   ten   years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.  
  The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at   October 2, 2016   would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

     We recently announced a new alignment of our businesses effective October 3, 2016 to better position us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings through an improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations. Our diagnostics business, focused on reproductive health, emerging market diagnostic solutions and applied genomics, will become a standalone business segment seeking to better meet the needs of clinically oriented customers in regulated markets. Microfluidics and automation products within the research market were combined with the existing diagnostics business to form the Diagnostics segment. The remaining products within the research market were combined with the existing Environmental Health business to form the Discovery   Analytical Solutions segment. This combination is intended to advance our success in serving and innovating for our applications-oriented customers in the food, environmental, industrial and life sciences markets.  
  Overview of the   Third   Quarter of Fiscal Year   2016    
  Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending   January 1, 2017   ("  fiscal year 2016  ") will include   52   weeks, while the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   ("  fiscal year 2015  ") included   53   weeks. The additional week in fiscal year 2015 was reflected in our third quarter, which consisted of   14   weeks as compared to our third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which consisted of   13   weeks. 
  Our overall revenue in the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   was   $548.1 million   and   decrease  d   $15.4 million  , or   3%  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  , reflecting a   decrease   of   $5.4 million  , or   2%  , in our Human Health segment revenue and a   decrease   of   $10.0 million  , or   5%  , in our Environmental Health segment revenue. The   decrease   in our Human Health segment revenue during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings within our research market due to reduced government funding and weaker demand in our medical imaging business, which was partially offset by the strong performance of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as China, as well as Europe. The   decrease   in our Environmental Health segment revenue during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   was primarily due to a   decrease   in our food and environmental business due to weak harvest conditions. 
  In our Human Health segment, we experienced growth during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   in several of our products within our end markets, as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  . In our diagnostics market, we experienced growth from continued expansion of our newborn screening, blood banking and screening businesses. Birth rates in the United States continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the United States is also increasing, as evidenced by prenatal trends during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  . This was offset by weaker demand in our medical imaging business due to a change in customer ordering patterns. In our research market, we experienced

     Table of Contents  

decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding and a slight decrease in revenue in our OneSource service offerings due to the timing of renewals. Our OneSource business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for them.  
  In our Environmental Health segment, we had a   decrease   in revenue for the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  . The   decrease   in revenue was due to lower sales in our food and environmental business within our environmental and industrial markets due to weak harvest conditions. We nevertheless anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient, analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions. 
  Our consolidated gross margins   increase  d   240   basis points in the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  , primarily due to favorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of higher gross margin product offerings. Our consolidated operating margins   increase  d   135   basis points in the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  , primarily due to higher gross margins and lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives, which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development. 
  We continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. Overall, we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets, coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, bad debts, inventories, accounting for business combinations and dispositions, long-lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Critical accounting policies are those policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe our critical accounting policies include our policies regarding revenue recognition, warranty costs, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, business combinations, value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, employee compensation and benefits, restructuring activities, gains or losses on dispositions and income taxes. 
  For a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and Item 7.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 3, 2016   (our    2015   Form 10-K ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  .

  Restructuring and Contract Termination Charges, Net 
    
  We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy, the integration of our business units and our productivity initiatives. The current portion of restructuring and contract termination charges is recorded in accrued restructuring and contract termination charges and the long-term portion of restructuring and contract termination charges is recorded in long-term liabilities. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges, net, as applicable, and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. 
    
  We implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth product lines (the "Q3 2016 Plan"). We implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q2 2016 Plan").We implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 consisting of workforce reductions and closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets (the "Q4 2015 Plan"). We implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the "Q2 2015 Plan").

We expect to make payments under the Previous Plans for remaining residual lease obligations, with terms varying in length, through fiscal year   2022  . 
    
  We also terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. We recorded additional pre-tax charges of   $0.1 million   during   fiscal year 2015   in our Environmental Health segment as a result of these contract terminations. 
    
  At   October 2, 2016  , we had   $12.9 million   recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges, of which   $9.1 million   was recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and contract termination charges and   $3.8 million   was recorded in long-term liabilities. At   January 3, 2016  , we had   $22.2 million   recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges, of which   $17.1 million   was recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and contract termination charges and   $5.1 million   was recorded in long-term liabilities.

Interest and Other Expense, Net 
  Interest and other expense, net, consisted of the following: 

Interest and other expense, net, for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   an expense   of   $11.3 million  , as compared to   an expense   of   $11.9 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $0.6 million  . The   decrease   in interest and other expense, net, for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , was primarily due to a net decrease in other expenses, net by   $1.8 million   which consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by an increase in interest expense by   $1.1 million   due to the issuance of the new higher interest rate 2026 notes, and a concurrent paydown of the lower variable rate previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
  Interest and other expense, net, for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   an expense   of   $27.7 million  , as compared to   an expense   of   $32.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $4.5 million  . The decrease was primarily due to a gain on disposition of businesses and assets, net recognized during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   which was partially offset by an   increase   in interest expense of   $2.2 million   due to the issuance of the new higher interest rate 2026 notes as well as an increase in borrowings under our previous and new senior unsecured revolving credit facilities partially offset by a   decrease   in other expense, net of   $1.2 million  , consisting primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of non-functional currency assets and liabilities.

The   lower   effective tax rate during the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  , as compared to the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2015  , was due to certain lower tax rate jurisdictions projected to have higher income in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 and higher tax benefits related to discrete items, which were   $7.1 million   in the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  , as compared to   $5.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2015  . 
    
  Disposition of Businesses and Assets 
  As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. When the discontinued operations represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements,  we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations, and accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations. Any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-08,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of An Entity,   continues to be reported as a discontinued operations, and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  . 
  During   fiscal years 2016 and 2015  , we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of discontinued operations and recognized a net pre-tax gain of   $0.6 million   and a net pre-tax loss of   $0.03 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, and a net pre-tax gain of   $0.6 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  . We

recorded a tax   provision   of   $0.3 million   and a tax benefit of    $2.4 million   on discontinued operations and dispositions for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , respectively. We recorded a tax   provision   of   $0.04 million   and   $0.01 million   on discontinued operations and dispositions for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , respectively. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our investment in PerkinElmer Labs, Inc., recognizing a pre-tax gain of   $7.1 million  . The sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of   $7.3 million  , which resulted in an income tax benefit of   $2.5 million   that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016. PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. was a component of our Human Health segment. The pre-tax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The divestiture of PerkinElmer Labs, Inc. has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-Q because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into a letter of intent to contribute certain assets to an academic institution in the United Kingdom. We recognized a pre-tax loss of   $1.6 million   related to the write-off of assets in the second quarter of 2016 which is included in interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
  Contingencies, Including Tax Matters 
  We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued   $10.3 million   and   $11.8 million   as of   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  , respectively, which represents our management s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. These amounts were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to   ten   years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded. 
  Various tax years after   2009   remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. 
  We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at   October 2, 2016   would not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. 

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations 
  Human Health 
  Revenue for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $338.2 million  , as compared to   $343.6 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $5.4 million  , or   2%  , which includes a   2%   net   decrease   in revenue attributable to the impact of prior year acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisted of   13   weeks as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, which consisted of   14   weeks. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by market and product type for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures. The   decrease   in revenue in our Human Health segment reflects a   decrease   of   $5.6 million   from our research market revenue

partially offset by an   increase   of   $0.2 million   from our diagnostics market revenue. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize   $0.2 million   of revenue in our Human Health segment for each of the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. In our Human Health segment, we experienced growth during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   in several of our products within our end markets, as compared to the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2015  .  In our diagnostics market, we experienced growth from continued expansion of our newborn screening, blood banking and screening businesses. Birth rates in the United States continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the United States is also increasing, as evidenced by prenatal trends during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  . This was offset by weaker demand in our medical imaging business due to a change in customer ordering patterns. In our research market, we experienced decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings and a slight decrease in revenue in our OneSource service offerings. Decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings was primarily a result of reduced government funding. The slight decreases in revenue in our OneSource service offering is primarily due to the timing of renewals. Our OneSource business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for them. 
  Revenue for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $1,024.2 million  , as compared to   $1,011.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , an   increase   of   $13.0 million  , or   1%  , which includes an approximate   1%     decrease   in revenue attributable to prior year acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the additional week in fiscal year 2015 was reflected in our third quarter, which consisted of   14   weeks as compared to our third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which consisted of   13   weeks. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected revenue by market and product type for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The   increase   in revenue in our Human Health segment reflects an   increase   in diagnostics market revenue of   $10.7 million   and an   increase   in research market revenue of   $2.3 million  . As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize   $0.5 million   of revenue in our Human Health segment for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015   that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods. In our diagnostics market, we experienced growth from continued expansion of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets such as China. Birth rates in the United States continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the United States is also increasing, as evidenced by prenatal trends during the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016  . Demand in our medical imaging business declined slightly due to a change in customer ordering patterns. In our research market, we experienced growth in our OneSource service offerings, which was primarily offset by decreases in revenue from our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding.  
  Operating income from continuing operations for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $64.6 million  , as compared to   $63.1 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , an   increase   of   $1.5 million  , or   2%  . Amortization of intangible assets   decrease  d and was   $13.7 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $15.3 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  . Restructuring and contract termination charges, net, were   $0.4 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $0.2 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  . Other purchase accounting adjustments   added an incremental expense of     $4.1 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $0.03 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  . Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses   added an incremental expense of     $0.4 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $0.1 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  . In addition to the above items,   increase  d operating income for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , was primarily the result of favorable changes in product mix, with an increase in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain. 
  Operating income from continuing operations for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $176.9 million  , as compared to   $179.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $2.7 million  , or   1%  . Amortization of intangible assets   decrease  d and was   $41.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $46.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  .

Other purchase accounting adjustments   added an incremental expense of     $9.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $0.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses   added an incremental expense of     $0.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   an incremental expense of     $0.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . In addition to the above items,   decrease  d operating income for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , was primarily the result of increased costs related to investments in new product development, which were partially offset by pricing initiatives and lower costs related to cost containment and productivity initiatives.

The   decrease   in revenue in our Environmental Health segment reflects a   decrease   of   $9.6 million   from our environmental and industrial revenue due to weak harvest conditions and a   decrease   of   $0.4 million   from our laboratory services market revenue.  
  Revenue for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $635.2 million  , as compared to   $643.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $7.9 million  , or   1%  , which includes an approximate   2%     decrease   in revenue attributable to   unfavorable   changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate   1%     increase   in revenue attributable to acquisitions.

The   decrease   in revenue in our Environmental Health segment reflects a   decrease   in environmental and industrial markets revenue of   $13.4 million   partially offset by an   increase   in laboratory services market revenue of   $5.6 million  .  
  Operating income from continuing operations for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016   was   $27.7 million  , as compared to   $22.8 million   for the   three   months ended   October 4, 2015  , an   increase   of   $4.9 million  , or   21%  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. 
  Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include: 
             
    changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and 
                
    changes in our working capital requirements. 
     
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include: 
             
    financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity, 
                
    increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt, 
                
    a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market, 
                
    increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, 
                
    a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and 
                
    volatility in the public debt and equity markets. 
     At   October 2, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $311.7 million  , of which   $303.3 million   was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had   $935.6 million   of additional borrowing capacity available under our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We had no other liquid investments at   October 2, 2016  .  
  We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Of the   $303.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries at   October 2, 2016  , we would incur U.S. taxes on approximately   $287.2 million   if transferred to the U.S. without proper planning. We expect the accumulated non-U.S. cash balances, which may not be transferred to the U.S. without incurring U.S. taxes, will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. 
  On October 23, 2014, our Board of Directors (our "Board") authorized us to repurchase up to   8.0 million   shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program").  On July 27, 2016, our Board authorized us to immediately terminate the Repurchase Program and further authorized us to repurchase up to 8.0 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the "New Repurchase Program"). The New Repurchase Program will expire on July 26, 2018 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we repurchased   3.2 million   shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of   $148.2 million  , including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its cancellation. As of   October 2, 2016  ,   8.0 million   shares remained available for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program.  
  In addition, our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we repurchased   72,058   shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of   $3.4 million  . 
  The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the New Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities. 
  During the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  , we contributed   $7.6 million  , in the aggregate, to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the United States, and expect to contribute an additional   $1.7 million   by the end of   fiscal year 2016  . We could potentially have to make additional contributions in future periods for all pension plans. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.

     Table of Contents  

Our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. We recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the fourth quarter of the year in which the gains and losses occur, unless there is an interim remeasurement required for one of our plans. It is difficult to reliably predict the magnitude of such adjustments for gains and losses in   fiscal year 2016  . These adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, a loss to operations will be recorded in   fiscal year 2016  . Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, a gain will be recorded in   fiscal year 2016  . 
  Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities.   Net cash provided by continuing operations was   $198.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $161.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  ,   an increase   in cash provided by operating activities of   $37.0 million  . The cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   was principally a result of income from continuing operations of   $166.5 million   adjusted for depreciation and amortization of   $79.3 million  , stock-based compensation expense of   $13.8 million  , restructuring and contract termination charges, net of   $5.7 million  , change in fair value of contingent consideration of   $9.7 million   and gain from disposition of businesses and assets, net of   $5.6 million  . These items were partially offset by a net cash   decrease   in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items of   $69.0 million   and a net cash   decrease   in working capital of   $1.5 million  . Contributing to the net cash   decrease   in working capital for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was   an increase   in inventory of   $12.4 million  , which was partially offset by   a decrease   in accounts receivable of   $1.8 million   and   an increase   in accounts payable of   $9.0 million  . The   increase   in inventory was primarily a result of expanding the amount of inventory held at sales locations within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to improve responsiveness to customer requirements and for the introduction of new products. The   decrease   in accounts receivable was a result of accounts receivable collections during the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  . The   increase   in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the first   nine   months of   fiscal year 2016  . Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items   decrease  d cash provided by operating activities by   $69.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $49.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . These changes primarily related to the timing of payments for pensions, taxes, restructuring, and salary and benefits. 
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   the investing activities of our continuing operations was   $78.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $35.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $42.5 million  . For the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the net cash used in investing activities of our continuing operations was principally a result of capital expenditures of   $25.3 million   and   $71.9 million   of cash used for acquisitions and investments. These items were partially offset by cash proceeds of   $21.0 million  , net of   $2.0 million   in restricted cash from the sale of businesses. Net cash used for capital expenditures was   $17.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . The capital expenditures in each period were primarily for manufacturing and other capital equipment purchases. In addition, during the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , we used   $18.7 million   in cash for acquisitions and investments. 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash used in financing activities was   $52.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , as compared to   $92.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $39.8 million  . For the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we repurchased   3.3 million   shares of our common stock, which includes   72,058   shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for a total cost of   $151.6 million  , including commissions. This compares to repurchases of   1.6 million   shares of common stock, which includes   89,558   shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , for a total cost of   $76.2 million  , including commissions. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans was   $12.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   as compared to   $13.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , debt borrowings on our previous and new senior unsecured revolving credit facilities totaled   $375.5 million  , which were offset by debt payments of   $804.5 million  . During the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  , debt payments on our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled   $371.0 million  , which were offset by debt borrowings of   $347.0 million  . During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , proceeds from the sale of our senior unsecured debt was   $546.2 million  , and we paid   $7.9 million   for debt issuance costs. We paid   $23.1 million   and   $23.7 million   in dividends during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively. We had net payments on other credit facilities of   $0.8 million   during each of the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we received   $1.7 million   for settlement of forward foreign exchange contracts, as compared to   $19.2 million   received for the   nine   months ended   October 4, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we made   $0.1 million   in payments for acquisition-related contingent consideration.

Borrowing Arrangements 
  Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.   On August 11, 2016, we terminated our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five year term and an expansion of borrowing capacity from   $700.0 million   to   $1.0 billion  . The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for   $1.0 billion   of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of   August 11, 2021  . As of   October 2, 2016  , undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of   $11.4 million   were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of   October 2, 2016  , we had   $935.6 million   available for additional borrowing under the facility. We use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate or the base rate at the time of borrowing, plus a margin. The base rate is the higher of (i) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or (iii) an adjusted one-month Libor plus 1.00%. At   October 2, 2016  , borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were accruing interest primarily based on the Eurocurrency rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of   October 2, 2016   was   110   basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of   October 2, 2016   was   0.56%  , resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of   1.66%  . As of   October 2, 2016  , the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of   $48.5 million  , which was net of   $4.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of   January 3, 2016  , the previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an aggregate carrying value of   $479.6 million  , which was net of   $2.4 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. The credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as our debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that our debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  5%   Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2021.   On October 25, 2011, we issued   $500.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 (the "2021 Notes") in a registered public offering and received   $496.9 million   of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2021 Notes were issued at   99.372%   of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of   $3.1 million  . As of   October 2, 2016  , the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $495.7 million  , net of   $1.8 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $2.6 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of   January 3, 2016  , the 2021 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $495.1 million  , net of   $2.0 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $2.9 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. The 2021 Notes mature in   November 2021   and bear interest at an annual rate of   5%  . Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th each year. Prior to August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 Notes being redeemed, discounted on a semi-annual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 45 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time on or after August 15, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2021 Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 Notes below investment grade, each holder of 2021 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holder's 2021 Notes for   101%   of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  1.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026.   On July 19, 2016, we issued    500.0 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) in a registered public offering and received approximately    492.3 million   of net proceeds from the issuance. The 2026 Notes were issued at   99.118%   of the principal amount, which resulted in a discount of    4.4 million  . The 2026 Notes mature in   July 2026   and bear interest at an annual rate of   1.875%  . Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable annually on July 19th each year. The proceeds from the 2026 Notes were used to pay in full the outstanding balance of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of   October 2, 2016  , the 2026 Notes had an aggregate carrying value of   $551.6 million  , net of   $4.9 million   of unamortized original issue discount and   $4.9 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
   Prior to April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2026 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2026 Notes being redeemed, discounted on an annual basis, at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) plus 35 basis points; plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, at any time on or after April 19, 2026 (three months prior to their maturity date), we may redeem the 2026

Notes, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes due to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes) and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2026 Notes below investment grade, we will, in certain circumstances, make an offer to purchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
  Financing Lease Obligations.   In fiscal year 2012, we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings. We provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings, and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs. We are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under sale-leaseback accounting guidance, representing debt obligations for us and non-cash investing and financing activities. As a result, we capitalized   $29.3 million   in property, plant and equipment, net, representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt. We have also capitalized   $11.5 million   in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings, which were funded by the lessors, with a corresponding increase to debt. At   October 2, 2016  , we had   $37.4 million   recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which   $1.2 million   was recorded as short-term debt and   $36.2 million   was recorded as long-term debt. At   January 3, 2016  , we had   $38.2 million   recorded for these financing lease obligations, of which   $1.1 million   was recorded as short-term debt and   $37.1 million   was recorded as long-term debt. The buildings are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values, which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the remaining balances in property, plant and equipment, net and debt will be reversed against each other. 

Dividends 
  Our Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of   $0.07   per share for each of the first three quarters of   fiscal year 2016   and for each quarter of   fiscal year 2015  . At   October 2, 2016  , we had accrued   $7.7 million   for dividends declared on   July 27, 2016   for the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   that will be payable on   November 10, 2016  . On   October 26, 2016  , we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.07   per share for the   fourth   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   that will be payable on   February 10, 2017  . In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.  

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations, as described in the contractual obligations table contained in Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 have changed due to new lease agreements for certain operating facilities, changes to our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and issuance of senior unsecured notes. 
  During the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  , we entered into new lease agreements for certain operating facilities. Our total rental payments to the lessors are now expected to be   $14.0 million   for the remainder of fiscal year 2016,   $44.1 million   for fiscal year 2017,   $31.6 million   for fiscal year 2018,   $24.8 million   for fiscal year 2019,   $20.6 million   for fiscal year 2020 and   $70.0 million   in the aggregate thereafter.  
  On August 11, 2016, we terminated our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five year term and an expansion of borrowing capacity from $700.0 million to $1.0 billion. As of October 2, 2016, our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial maturity of August 11, 2021 had an aggregate outstanding amount of $53.0 million. As of October 2, 2016, we had no outstanding obligation in our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  The new senior unsecured revolving credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates and the outstanding amount of $53.0 million does not include interest obligations. 
  On July 19, 2016, we issued  500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) in a registered public offering. The 2026 Notes mature in July 2026 and bear interest at an annual rate of 1.875%. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable annually on July 19th each year. Our total debt payments under the 2026 Notes are expected to be  9.375 million for fiscal year 2017,  9.375 million for fiscal year 2018,  9.375 million for fiscal year 2019,  9.375 million for fiscal year 2020,  9.375 million for fiscal year 2021 and  546.875 million in the aggregate thereafter. These payments include interest obligations. As of October 2, 2016, the 2026 Notes had a carrying value of $551.6 million, net of $4.9 million of unamortized original issue discount and $4.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
  There have not been any other material changes during the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. 

Effects of Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230 and other topics. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, and if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, ASU 2016-15 allows the amendments for those issues to be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard requires entities to use the expected loss impairment model and will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Entities are required to estimate the lifetime  expected credit loss  for each applicable financial asset and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an AFS debt security is a credit loss. An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on an AFS debt security as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU No. 2016-09"). The new standard simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory withholding requirements, as well as the related classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires an entity to recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and such tax benefits and tax deficiencies are not included in the estimate of an entity s annual effective tax rate, applied on a prospective basis. Further, the standard eliminates the requirement to defer the recognition of excess tax benefits until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. All excess tax benefits previously unrecognized, along with any valuation allowance, should be recognized on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under ASU No. 2016-09, an entity that applies the treasury stock method in calculating diluted earnings per share is required to exclude excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of assumed proceeds since such amounts are recognized in the income statement. Excess tax benefits should also be classified as operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes on the statement of cash flows, as such excess tax benefits no longer represent financing activities since they are recognized in the income statement, and should be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted ASU No. 2016-09 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We recorded a cumulative increase of   $14.2 million   in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 retained earnings with a corresponding increase in deferred tax assets related to the prior years' unrecognized excess tax benefits. Excess tax benefits related to exercised options and vested restricted stock and restricted stock units during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   have been recognized in the current period s income statement. We also excluded the excess tax benefits from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  . We applied the cash flow presentation section of the guidance on a prospective basis, and the prior period statement of cash flows was not adjusted. ASU No. 2016-09 also allows an entity to elect as an accounting policy either to continue to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered or to account for forfeitures for service based awards as they occur. An entity that elects to account for forfeitures as they occur should apply the accounting change on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of this accounting policy did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for financing and operating leases. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . Under this new guidance, companies that use inventory measurement methods other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early

adoption permitted. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . Under this new guidance, an entity should use a five-step process to recognize revenue, depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequent to the issuance of the standard, the FASB decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12")  ,   which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In April 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ("ASU 2016-10")  ,   which amended its revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of the contract, clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable (i.e., distinct within the context of the contract) and allow an entity to elect to account for the cost of shipping and handling performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost (i.e., an expense). ASU 2016-10 also clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property ("IP") and requires entities to classify IP in one of two categories: functional IP or symbolic IP, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. ASU 2016-10 also address how entities should consider license renewals and restrictions and apply the exception for sales- and usage-based royalties received in exchange for licenses of IP.  ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the requirements of the foregoing standards and has not yet determined the impact of their adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We intend to adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach, and we do not intend to early adopt these standards.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Market Risk.   We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures. We briefly describe several of the market risks we face below. Except for the net investment hedge on foreign operations that we entered into during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, the following disclosure is not materially different from the disclosure provided under the heading, Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,    in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk.   The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately   60%   of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in natural hedges. 
    
  We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. Although we attempt to manage our foreign exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income generally will be positively but not proportionately impacted. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will generally be negatively but not proportionately impacted. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed   12   months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.  
    
  Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar. We held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling   $128.5 million  ,   $127.3 million   and   $104.7 million   at   October 2, 2016  ,   January 3, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally   30   days or less during each of the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . 
    
  In addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. We record these hedges at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined Euro notional amounts of    50.7 million   and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of   $9.2 million  . The combined Euro notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was    107.4 million   and    108.7 million   as of   January 3, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the   nine   months ending   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . We paid   $0.1 million   and received   $19.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively, from the settlement of these hedges. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of  492.3 million to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), as  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

well as to offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. The foreign currency forward contracts were settled during the third quarter of 2016 and we recorded a net realized foreign exchange gain in AOCI amounting to $1.8 million during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we designated the 2026 Notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as to offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of   October 2, 2016  , the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was    495.7 million  . The unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge was   $10.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  .  
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Value-at-Risk Disclosure  . We continue to measure foreign currency risk using the Value-at-Risk model described in Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,    in our   2015   Form 10-K. The measures for our Value-at-Risk analysis have not changed materially. 
  Interest Rate Risk.   As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures. 
  Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity  . Our   2015   Form 10-K presents sensitivity measures for our interest rate risk. The measures for our sensitivity analysis have not changed materially. More information is available in Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk,    in our   2015   Form 10-K for our sensitivity disclosure. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter ended   October 2, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter ended   October 2, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   October 2, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
     We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at   October 2, 2016   should not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations: 
  If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations. 
  Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers  markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. 
  Our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities. 
  Our business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets, particularly as the United States and other countries balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.  
  While we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
  Certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments. 
  If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. 
  We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: 
             
    accurately anticipate customer needs, 
                
    innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications, 
                
    successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, 
                
    price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and 
                
    differentiate our offerings from our competitors  offerings. 
     Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers  expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers  needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner. 
  In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. 
  We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable, or successfully divest businesses. 
  We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics AB in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as: 
             
    competition among buyers and licensees, 
                
    the high valuations of businesses and technologies, 
                
    the need for regulatory and other approval, and 
                
    our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions. 
     Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. If, for example, we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant in-process research and development that we have capitalized, we may have to impair the value of such assets. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term. 
  To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability. 
  We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property. 
  Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property. 
  Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or  design around  our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries. 
  If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage. 
  We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share. 
  Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses. 
  If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. 
  We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines. 
  Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders. 
  Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include: 
             
    demand for and market acceptance of our products, 
                
    competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices, 
                
    changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, 
                
    changes in general economic conditions or government funding, 
                
    settlements of income tax audits, 
                
    expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations, 
                
    differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation, 
                
    changes in our effective tax rate, 
                
    changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical, 
                
    changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers, 
                
    our ability to introduce new products, 
                
    our competitors  announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations, 
     
   47 

     Table of Contents  

costs of raw materials, energy or supplies, 
                
    changes in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services, 
                
    our ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives, 
                
    changes in the volume or timing of product orders,  
                
    fluctuation in the expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, 
                
    changes in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations, 
                
    changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions, and 
                
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
     A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. 
  We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers. 
  Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. 
  The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. 
  We are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and their derivatives), which may be contained in our products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As a result of these rules, we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflict-free, and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs. 
  The manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability. 
  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. 
  If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil, criminal or monetary penalties. 
  Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. If we fail to comply with those regulations  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

or standards, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of the products produced by our Human Health segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution. 
  We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations. 
  Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. 
  We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. 
  The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations. 
  The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. 
  Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability. 
  Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2016  . We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 
             
    changes in actual, or from projected, foreign currency exchange rates, 
                
    changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, 
                
    longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions, 
                
    embargoes, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, 
                
    policies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the United States, 
                
    differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax, 
                
    adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives, 
                
    differing business practices associated with foreign operations, 
                
    difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States, 
                
    difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, 
                
    differing labor laws and changes in those laws, 
     
   49 

     Table of Contents  

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, 
                
    increasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and 
                
    differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. 
     If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. 
  Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. 
  Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
  If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or inadvertent transfer of information, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected. 
  We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop, manufacture and provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. 
  We have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business. 
       
  We have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: 
             
    requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases; 
                
    reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and 
                
    exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. 
     In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. 
  Restrictions in our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities. 
  Our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, 2021 Notes and 2026 Notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: 
             
    pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, 
                
    sell assets, 
                
    incur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries  ability to make dividend or other payments to us, 
                
    guarantee or secure indebtedness, 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates, and 
     
   50 

     Table of Contents  

consolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
     We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments. 
  Any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, 2021 Notes, 2026 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances.  
  The approval of the Brexit Referendum in the U.K may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  In a referendum vote held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Nearly 5% of our net sales in 2015 came from the U.K. At this time, we are not able to predict the impact that this vote will have on the economy in Europe, including in the U.K., or on the Great Britain Pound (the  GBP ) or other European exchange rates. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business, and if such conditions emerge in the U.K. or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our sales. In addition, any significant weakening of the GBP to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our European revenues due to the importance of U.K. sales.  
  Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , our total assets included   $2.8 billion   of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, customer relationships, core technology and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items specifically all of those that are considered  non-amortizing  at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets. 
  Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Human Health and Environmental Health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Our share price will fluctuate. 
  Over the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by: 
             
    operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, 
                
    the financial performance of the major end markets that we target, 
                
    the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us, 
                
    announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, and 
                
    changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets. 
     Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future. 
  On   July 27, 2016  , we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.07   per share for the   third   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   that will be payable on   November 10, 2016  . On   October 26, 2016  , we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.07   per share for the   fourth   quarter of   fiscal year 2016   that will be payable on   February 10, 2017  . In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEBORAH A. BUTTERS AND PERKINELMER

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

2EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  
    
  This Employment Agreement (the  Agreement ) made this 11th day of July, 2016 between PerkinElmer, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (hereinafter called the  Company ), and   Deborah Butters   (hereinafter referred to as the  Employee ). 
  WITNESSETH  : 
  WHEREAS, the Company wishes to employ the Employee in a management position; and 
  WHEREAS, the Employee hereby agrees to the compensation herein provided and agrees to serve the Company to the best of her ability during the period of this Agreement. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the sum of One Dollar, and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
           1. 
    (1)    Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the Company agrees to employ the employee in a management position with the Company, and the Employee agrees to remain in the employment of the Company in that capacity for a period of one year from the date hereof and from year to year thereafter until such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Paragraph 5. 
              (a)  
    The Company will, during each year of the term of this Agreement, place in nomination before the Board of Directors of the Company the name of the Employee for election as an Officer of the Company except when a notice of termination has been given in accordance with Paragraph 5(b). 
              2.  
    The Employee agrees that, during the specified period of employment, she shall, to the best of her ability, perform her duties, and shall devote her full business time, best efforts, business judgment, skill and knowledge to the advancement of the Company and its interests and to the discharge of her duties and responsibilities hereunder.  The Employee shall not engage in any business, profession or occupation which would conflict with the rendition of the agreed-upon services, either directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, except for personal investment, charitable and philanthropic activities. 
              3.  
    During the period of her employment under this Agreement, the Employee shall be compensated for her services as follows: 
              (a)  
    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, she shall be paid a salary  
     
   1 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

during the period of this Agreement at a base rate to be determined by the Company on an annual basis.  Except as provided in Paragraph 3(d), such annual base salary shall under no circumstances be fixed at a rate below the annual base rate then currently in effect; 
           (b)  
    She shall be reimbursed for any and all monies expended by her in connection with her employment for reasonable and necessary expenses on behalf of the Company in accordance with the policies of the Company then in effect; 
              (c)  
    She shall be eligible to participate under any and all bonus, benefit, pension, compensation, and equity and incentive plans which are, in accordance with Company policy and the terms of the plan, available to persons in her position (within the limitation as stipulated by such plans).  Such eligibility shall not automatically entitle her to participate in any such plan; 
              (d)  
    If, because of adverse business conditions or for other reasons, the Company at any time puts into effect salary reductions applicable at a single rate to all management employees of the Company generally, the salary payments required to be made under this Agreement to the Employee during any period in which such general reduction is in effect may be reduced by the same percentage as is applicable to all management employees of the Company generally.  Any benefits made available to the Employee which are related to base salary shall also be reduced in accordance with any salary reduction. 
              4.  
    %3.    So long as the Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of one year after the termination or expiration of employment, the Employee will not directly or indirectly: (i) as an individual proprietor, partner, stockholder, officer, employee, director, joint venturer, investor, lender, or in any other capacity whatsoever (other than as the holder of not more than one percent (1%) of the total outstanding stock of a publicly held company), engage directly or indirectly in any business or entity which competes with the business conducted by the Company or its affiliates in any city or geographic area in which the Company or its affiliates conduct material operations at the time of termination of employment under this Agreement, except as approved in advance by the Board after full and adequate disclosure; or (ii) recruit, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any employee or employees or consultant or consultants of the Company to terminate their employment with, to otherwise cease their relationship with, the Company; or (iii) solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away, the business or patronage of any of the clients, customers or accounts, of the Company. 
     
   2 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

(a)  
    If any restriction set forth in this Paragraph 4 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographical area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable. 
              (b)  
    The restrictions contained in this Paragraph 4 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Company and are considered by the Employee to be reasonable for such purpose.  The Employee agrees that any breach of this Paragraph 4 will cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies which may be available, the Company shall have the right to seek specific performance and injunctive relief. 
              (c)  
    The Employee agrees to sign and be bound by the Employee Patent and Proprietary Information Utilization Agreement in the form attached hereto. 
              (d)  
    During the period of her employment by the Company or for any period during which the Company shall continue to pay the Employee her salary under this Agreement, whichever shall be longer, the Employee shall not in any way whatsoever aid or assist any party seeking to cause, initiate or effect a Change in Control of the Company as defined in Paragraph 6 without the prior approval of the Board of Directors. 
              5.  
    Except for the Employee covenants set forth in Paragraph 4, which covenants shall remain in effect for the periods stated therein, and subject to Paragraph 6, this Agreement shall terminate upon the happening of any of the following events and (except as provided herein) all of the Company s obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, making payments to the Employee shall cease and terminate: 
              (a)  
    On the effective date set forth in any resignation submitted by the Employee and accepted by the Company, or if no effective date is agreed upon, the date of receipt by the Company of such resignation letter; 
              (b)  
    On the date set forth in a written notice of termination given by the Company to the Employee (the  Paragraph 5(b) Termination Date  
              (c)  
    At the death of the Employee; 
     
   3 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

(d)  
    At the termination of the Employee for cause.  As used in the Agreement, the term  cause  shall mean: 
              (i)  
    Misappropriating any funds or property of the Company; 
              (ii)  
    Unreasonable refusal to perform the duties assigned to her under this Agreement; 
              (iii)  
    Conviction of a felony; 
              (iv)  
    Continuous conduct bringing notoriety to the Company and having an adverse effect on the name or public image of the Company; 
              (v)  
    Violation of the Employee s covenants as set forth in Paragraph 4 above; or 
              (vi)  
    Continued failure by the Employee to observe any of the provisions of this Agreement after being informed of such breach. 
              (e)  
    Twelve months after written notice of termination (a  Disability Termination Notice ) is given by the Company to the Employee based on a determination by the Board of Directors that the Employee is disabled (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean that the Employee is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months, with such determination to be made by the Board of Directors, in reliance upon the opinion of the Employee s physician or upon the opinion of one or more physicians selected by the Company).  A Disability Termination Notice shall be deemed properly delivered if given by the Company to the Employee on the 180th day of continuous disability of the Employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the twelve-month period following proper delivery of a Disability Termination Notice as aforesaid, the Employee is no longer disabled and is able to return to work, such Disability Termination Notice shall be deemed automatically rescinded upon the Employee s return to work, and the employment of the Employee shall continue in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  During the first 180 days of continuous disability of the Employee, the Company will make monthly payments to the Employee in an amount equal to the difference  
     
   4 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

between her base salary and the benefits received by the Employee under the Company s Short-Term Disability Income Plan.  During the twelve-month period following proper delivery of a Disability Termination Notice as aforesaid, the Company will make monthly payments to the Employee in an amount equal to the difference between her base salary and the benefits provided by the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan.  If any payments to the Employee under the Company s Long-Term Disability Plan are not subject to federal income taxes, the payments to be made directly by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be reduced such that the total amount received by the Employee (from the Company and from the Long-Term Disability Plan), after payment of any income taxes, is equal to the amount that the Employee would have received had she been paid her base salary, after payment of any income taxes on such base salary. 
           (f)  
    In the event of the termination of the Employee by the Company pursuant to Paragraph 5(b) above, and subject to the Employee s full execution of a severance agreement and release drafted by and satisfactory to counsel for the Company, the Employee shall (i) for a period of one year from the Paragraph 5(b) Termination Date, (continue to receive her Full Salary (as defined below), which shall be payable in accordance with the payment schedule in effect immediately prior to her employment termination, and (ii) receive from the Company a lump sum payment in an amount equal to (A) the amount the Company would have paid for a one-year period for premiums under the health, dental, vision, life/accidental death   disability, and short term and long-term disability plans in which the Employee and her dependents were participating immediately prior to the Paragraph 5(b) Termination Date and (B) the annual (one-year) benefit to the Employee under the Company s executive physical program, which lump sum amount payable pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined based  on the premium rates and benefits in effect as of the Paragraph 5(b) Termination Date.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Full Salary  shall mean the Employee s annual base salary, plus the amount of any bonus or incentive payments (excluding payments under the Company s long-term incentive program) earned or received by the Employee with respect to the last full fiscal year of the Company for which all bonus or incentive payments (excluding payments under the Company s long-term incentive program) to be made have been made.

If the condition is fully remedied with such time period there shall be no  Good Reason  and the Company shall not owe the amounts otherwise required to be paid under Paragraph 5, as amended by this Paragraph 6, in connection with the termination.   The Employee s right to terminate her employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by her incapacity due to physical or mental illness. 
           7.

              9.  
    Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power hereunder at any one or more  
     
   11 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times by either party.

    All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally to the Employee or to the General Counsel of the Company or when mailed by registered or certified mail to the other party (if to the Company, at 940 Winter Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451, attention General Counsel; if to the Employee, at the last known address of the Employee as set forth in the records of the Company). 
              11.  
    This Agreement has been executed and delivered and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  This Agreement is and shall be binding on the respective legal representatives or successors of the parties, but shall not be assignable except to a successor to the Company by virtue of a merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.  This Agreement constitutes and embodies the entire understanding and agreement of the parties and, except as otherwise provided herein, there are no other agreements or understandings, written or oral, in effect between the parties hereto relating to the employment of the Employee by the Company.  All previous employment contracts between the Employee and the Company or any of the Company s present or former subsidiaries or affiliates is hereby canceled and of no effect.

    The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to assume expressly in writing and to agree to perform its obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain an assumption of this Agreement prior to the effectiveness of succession shall be a breach of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement,  the Company  shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement, whether by operation of law, or otherwise. 
              13.  
    The parties intend that payments made pursuant to this Agreement be either exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder ( Section 409A ), so as not to be subject to the excise tax thereunder.  Accordingly, the following provisions shall apply to payments pursuant to this Agreement, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement:  
              (a)  
    Any payment of  reimbursements  by the Company to the Employee, any

              (c)  
    The payments that are to be paid by the Company to the Employee under Paragraphs 5 or 6 which (i) will constitute payments from a  non-qualified deferred compensation plan  as that term is used for the purposes of Section 409A  (after taking into account Paragraphs 13(a) and (b) above and any other exemptions available under Section 409A, including without limitation qualification as a  short term deferral  within the meaning of Section 409A), (ii) are payable prior to the date that is 6 months after the Employee s  separation from service  as that term is used for purposes of Section 409A ( Separation from Service ) (such date hereinafter referred to as the  Delayed Payment Date ), and (iii) do not exceed two (2) times the lesser of (I) or (II) below, shall be paid in accordance with the payment schedule that would otherwise apply under Paragraphs 5 or 6 in the absence of the application of Section 409A.  For purposes of this Paragraph 13(d),  (I)  shall mean the sum of the Employee s annualized compensation based upon her annual rate of pay for services provided to the Company for the calendar year preceding the Company s taxable year in which the Employee had a Separation from Service, and  (II)  shall mean the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Employee has a Separation from Service; 
              (d)  
    If the Employee is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code on the date of the Employee s  separation from service  as that term is used for purposes of Section 409A, the payments that are otherwise scheduled to be paid to the Employee under Paragraphs 5 or 6 prior to the Delayed Payment Date (determined without regard to this Paragraph 13) that exceed the amount calculated under Paragraph 13(d) above shall instead be paid by the Company to the Employee in a lump sum (together with interest at the  
     
   13 
  Employment Agreement 

Exhibit 10.2(9) 

prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of Separation from Service) one day after the Delayed Payment Date (or, if earlier, the death of the Employee); 
           (e)  
    The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement to the Employee, and the amount of in-kind benefits provided to the Employee, during any calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year;   
              (f)  
    The Company shall (i) have the right to deduct from any payment under this Agreement any and all taxes determined by the Company to be applicable with respect to such benefits and (ii) shall have the right to require the Employee to make arrangements satisfactory to satisfy any such withholding obligation that may not be satisfied in full by wage withholding described in (i); 
              (g)  
    The Employee shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to any payments or benefits hereunder except for the Company s portion of any Social Security and Medicare taxes.  The Company makes no guarantee regarding the tax treatment of the payments or benefits provided by this Agreement; 
              (h)  
    The reference in Section 5(f) to execution of a severance agreement and release shall be subject to the following terms.  Payments pursuant to Section 5(f) shall commence on the 60th day following the Employee s separation from service, provided that the Employee has executed and submitted the severance agreement and release and the agreement and release have become irrevocable.  The payment made on such 60th day shall include any periodic payments to which the Employee would have been entitled had payments commenced upon the Employee s separation from service; and  
              (i)  
    In determining whether a payment is made on permissible payment event or date, the rules of the Treasury Regulations and other guidance under Section 409A shall apply, including without limitation the rules of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(g) (related to disputed payments) and the rules of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(d) (generally permitting payment to be made at a later date within the same taxable year (or if later by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date specified) so long as the Employee is not permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the year of payment).
