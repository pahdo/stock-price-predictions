ASPEN INSURANCE HOLDINGS LIMITED 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. 
    History and Organization 
     Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited ( Aspen Holdings ) was incorporated on May 23, 2002 and holds subsidiaries that provide insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis. Its principal operating subsidiaries are Aspen Insurance UK Limited ( Aspen U.K. ), Aspen Bermuda Limited ( Aspen Bermuda ), Aspen Specialty Insurance Company ( Aspen Specialty ), Aspen American Insurance Company ( AAIC ) and Aspen Underwriting Limited (corporate member of Lloyd s Syndicate 4711,  AUL ) (collectively, the  Operating Subsidiaries ). We also established Aspen Capital Management, Ltd and other related entities (collectively,  ACM ) to leverage our existing underwriting franchise, increase our operational flexibility in the capital markets and provide investors direct access to our underwriting expertise. Silverton Re Ltd. ( Silverton ), a sidecar, was established in 2013 to attract third-party capital and to provide additional collateralized capacity to support Aspen Re s global reinsurance business. References to the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  refer to Aspen Holdings or Aspen Holdings and its subsidiaries. 
   
           2.   
    Basis of Preparation 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   December 31, 2016  . The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aspen Holdings and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 
  The balance sheet as at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on   February 19, 2016   (File No. 001-31909). There have been no changes to significant accounting policies from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Assumptions and estimates made by management have a significant effect on the amounts reported within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these relate to losses and loss adjustment expenses, the value of investments, reinsurance recoverables and the fair value of derivatives. All material assumptions and estimates are regularly reviewed and adjustments made as necessary, but actual results could be significantly different from those expected when the assumptions or estimates were made.  
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2016 
  On May 21, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2015-09,    Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944) Disclosures About Short-Duration Contracts    which requires insurance entities to disclose additional information about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, disclose information about significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and disclose a roll forward of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial results but it will have an impact on the disclosures in the Company s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q throughout 2017. 
  On September 25, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,    Business Combinations (Topic 805)    which requires an acquirer to adjust retrospectively to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and may impact the Company s provisional amounts booked in respect to the acquisition of AG Logic Holdings LLC ( AgriLogic ). 

9 

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)    which introduces a new impairment model, known as the current expected credit loss model, which is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new credit loss model, the Company would recognize an allowance for its estimate of expected credit losses and this would apply to most debt instruments (other than those measured at fair value), trade receivables, lease receivables, reinsurance receivables, financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments.  Available-for-sale debt securities are outside the model s scope and the ASU made limited amendments to the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. There are other amendments required as a result of this ASU that are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on future financial statements and disclosures. 
  Other accounting pronouncements were issued during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   which were either not relevant to the Company or did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.

    Earnings per Ordinary Share 
     Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing net income available to holders of Aspen Holdings  ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period of calculation using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

(1)   
    Dilutive securities comprise: employee options, restricted share units and performance shares associated with the Company s long-term incentive plan, employee share purchase plans and director restricted stock units and options as described in Note 14. 
     Dividends.   On October 26, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors ( the Board of Directors ) declared the following quarterly dividends: 

5.  
    Segment Reporting 
     The Company has   two   reporting business segments: Insurance and Reinsurance. In addition to the way the Company manages its business, the Company has considered similarities in economic characteristics, products, customers, distribution, the regulatory environment of the Company s business segments and quantitative thresholds to determine the Company s reportable segments. Segment profit or loss for each of the Company s business segments is measured by underwriting profit or loss. Underwriting profit is the excess of net earned premiums over the sum of losses and loss expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses. Underwriting profit or loss provides a basis for management to evaluate the business segment s underwriting performance. 
  Reinsurance Segment.   The reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe reinsurance, other property reinsurance (risk excess, pro rata and facultative), casualty reinsurance (U.S. treaty, international treaty and global facultative) and specialty reinsurance (credit and surety, agriculture insurance and reinsurance, marine, aviation, terrorism, engineering and other specialty lines). ACM forms part of our property catastrophe reinsurance line of business as it currently focuses on property catastrophe business through the use of alternative capital. For a more detailed description of this business segment, see Part I, Item 1,  Business   Business Segments   Reinsurance  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  
   12 

Insurance Segment.   The insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. For a more detailed description of this business segment, see Part I, Item 1  Business   Business Segments   Insurance  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Non-underwriting Disclosures.   The Company has provided additional disclosures for corporate and other (non-underwriting) income and expenses. Corporate and other income and expenses include net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses, expenses associated with managing the group, certain strategic and non-recurring costs, changes in fair value of derivatives and changes in fair value of the loan notes issued by variable interest entities, interest expenses, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes, none of which are allocated to the business segments. Corporate expenses are not allocated to the Company s business segments as they typically do not fluctuate with the levels of premiums written and are not directly related to the Company s business segment operations. The Company does not allocate its assets by business segment as it evaluates underwriting results of each business segment separately from the results of the Company s investment portfolio. 
  The following tables provide a summary of gross and net written and earned premiums, underwriting results, ratios and reserves for each of the Company s business segments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    The general and administrative expense ratio in the total column includes corporate expenses. 
     
   13 

(1)   
    The general and administrative expense ratio in the total column includes corporate expenses.

The following tables provide a summary of gross and net written and earned premiums, underwriting results, ratios and reserves for each of the Company s business segments for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    The general and administrative expense ratio in the total column includes corporate expenses. 
     
   15 

(1)   
    The general and administrative expense ratio in the total column includes corporate expenses. 
       
  The Company uses underwriting ratios as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned. The policy acquisition expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned. The general and administrative expense ratio is the ratio of general, administrative and corporate expenses to net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, the policy acquisition expense ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio.

6.     Investments 
  Income Statement 
  Investment Income.   The following table summarizes investment income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

17 

The following table summarizes the net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses recorded in the statement of operations and the change in unrealized gains and losses on investments recorded in other comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Other-than-temporary Impairments.   A security is potentially impaired when its fair value is below its amortized cost. The Company reviews its available for sale fixed income and equity portfolios on an individual security basis for potential other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) each quarter based on criteria including issuer-specific circumstances, credit ratings actions and general macro-economic conditions. For a more detailed description of OTTI, please refer to Note 2(c) of the  Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There was   no   OTTI charge recognized for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015     $  Nil   and $  Nil  , respectively).

Balance Sheet 
  Fixed Income Securities and Short-Term Investments       Available For Sale.   The following tables present the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair market value of available for sale investments in fixed income securities and short-term investments as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

There were non-cash transfers of securities from available for sale to trading of   $41.7 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The transfers were made following the decision by the North Dakota regulator to reduce the held capital requirement for the recognition of ceded reinsurance recoveries from Aspen Bermuda Limited from   100%   to   20%  .  This decision resulted in a new reduced collateral Regulation 114 trust being established and funded by non-cash transfers of securities from available for sale portfolios.   

19 

Fixed Income Securities, Short-Term Investments, Equities and Catastrophe Bonds   Trading.   The following tables present the cost or amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair market value of trading investments in fixed income securities, short-term investments, equity securities and catastrophe bonds as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company classifies the financial instruments presented in the tables above as held for trading as this most closely reflects the facts and circumstances of the investments held.  
  Catastrophe Bonds.   The Company has invested in catastrophe bonds with a total value of   $17.8 million   as at   September 30, 2016  .  The bonds receive quarterly interest payments based on variable interest rates with scheduled maturities ranging from 2016 to 2021.  The redemption value of the bonds will adjust based on the occurrence of a covered event, such as windstorms and earthquakes in the United States, Canada, the North Atlantic, Japan or Australia. 
  Other Investments.   In January 2015, the Company established, along with seven other insurance companies, a micro-insurance venture consortium and micro-insurance incubator ( MVI ) domiciled in Bermuda. The MVI is a social impact organization that provides micro-insurance products to assist global emerging consumers.  The Company s initial investment in the MVI was   $0.8 million  .  
  
   20 

On October 2, 2012, the Company established a subsidiary, Aspen Recoveries Limited, to take ownership of a   58.5%   shareholding in Chaspark Maritime Holdings Ltd., a Singaporean registered company ( Chaspark ), with the remaining shareholding owned by other insurers.  The shareholding in Chaspark was received as a settlement for subrogation rights associated with a contract frustration claim settlement. The Company has determined that Chaspark has the characteristics of a variable interest entity as addressed by the guidance in ASC 810-10,   Consolidation  . However, having considered the provisions of ASC 810-10, the Company s investment in Chaspark does not permit the Company to direct the activities which most significantly impact Chaspark s economic performance and the Company is not acting as principal or agent for a related party group of investors. Under these circumstances, the Company is not required to consolidate Chaspark. The investment is therefore accounted for under the equity method and adjustments to the carrying value of this investment are made based on the Company s share of capital, including share of income and expenses, which is provided in the quarterly management accounts. The adjusted carrying value of Chaspark approximates fair value. 
  On July 26, 2016, the Company purchased through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Acorn Limited, a   20%   share of Bene Assicurazioni ( Bene ), an Italian-based motor insurer for a total consideration of   $3.3 million  . The investment is accounted for under the equity method and adjustments to the carrying value of this investment are made based on the Company s share of capital, including share of income and expenses. 
   The tables below show the Company s investments in the MVI, Chaspark and Bene for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

21 

Fixed Income Securities.   The scheduled maturity distribution of available for sale fixed income securities as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is set forth in the tables below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

Guaranteed Investments.   As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company s holding of guaranteed investments was limited to   one   municipal security, rated CC or higher (  December 31, 2015       one   municipal security, rated CC or higher). The standalone rating (rating without guarantee) is determined as the senior unsecured debt rating of the issuer. Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, Standard   Poor s Financial Services LLC ( S P ) and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ), the lowest rating was used. The Company s exposure to other third-party guaranteed debt is primarily to investments backed by non-U.S. government guaranteed issuers. 
  
   22 

Gross Unrealized Loss.   The following tables summarize as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by type of security, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position in the Company s available for sale portfolio: 

7.  
    Variable Interest Entities 
     As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investments in   two   variable interest entities ( VIE ), Chaspark and Silverton.  
  Chaspark.   The Company has determined that Chaspark has the characteristics of a VIE as addressed by the guidance in ASC 810,   Consolidation  . As discussed in Note 6 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the investment in Chaspark is accounted for under the equity method. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,  
  
   23 

there was   $1.0 million   and   $1.0 million   unrealized gain, respectively, in the value of the Company s investment in Chaspark (  September 30, 2015     $  Nil   and $  Nil  ). The adjusted carrying value approximates fair value.  For more information on Chaspark, refer to Note 6 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Silverton.    On September 10, 2013, the Company established Silverton, a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer     formed to provide additional collateralized capacity to support Aspen Re s business through retrocession agreements which are collateralized and funded by Silverton through the issuance of one or more series of participating loan notes (collectively, the  Loan Notes ). Silverton is a non-rated insurer and the risks are fully collateralized by way of funds held in trust for the benefit of Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K., the ceding reinsurers. 
  All proceeds from the issuance of the Loan Notes were deposited into separate collateral accounts for each series of Loan Notes to fund Silverton s obligations under a retrocession property quota share agreement entered into with Aspen Bermuda or Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K, as the case may be. The holders of the Loan Notes participate in any profit or loss generated by Silverton attributable to the operations of the respective Silverton segregated account. Any existing value of the Loan Notes will be returned to the noteholders in installments after the expiration of the risk period of the retrocession agreement issued by Silverton for the related series of Loan Notes with the final payment being contractually due on the respective maturity dates.  
  The following tables show the total liability balance of the Loan Notes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Company has determined that Silverton has the characteristics of a VIE that are addressed by the guidance in ASC 810,   Consolidation  . The Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of Silverton as it owns all of Silverton s voting shares and issued share capital, and has a significant financial interest and the power to control Silverton.  As a result, the Company consolidated Silverton upon its formation.  The Company has no other obligation to provide financial support to Silverton and neither the creditors nor beneficial interest holders of Silverton have recourse to the Company s general credit.   
  In the event of an extreme catastrophic property reinsurance event or severe credit-related event, there is a risk that Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K. would be unable to recover losses from Silverton.  These two risks are mitigated as follows: 
  
   24 

i. 
    Silverton has collateralized the aggregate limit provided to Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K. by way of a trust in favor of Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K. as beneficiaries; 
              ii. 
    the trustee is a large, well-established regulated entity; and 
              iii. 
    all funds within the trust account are bound by investment guidelines restricting investments to one of the institutional class money market funds run by large international investment managers. 
     For further information regarding the Loan Notes attributable to the third-party investments in Silverton, refer to Note 8 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
           8.  
    Fair Value Measurements 
     The Company s estimates of fair value for financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance included in ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  . The framework prioritizes the inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, into three levels. 
  The Company considers prices for actively traded securities to be derived based on quoted prices in an active market for identical assets, which are Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The majority of these securities are valued using prices supplied by index providers. 
  The Company considers prices for other securities that may not be as actively traded which are priced via pricing services, index providers, vendors and broker-dealers, or with reference to interest rates and yield curves, to be derived based on inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, which are Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The majority of these securities are also valued using prices supplied by index providers. 
  The Company considers securities, other financial instruments and derivative insurance contracts subject to fair value measurement whose valuation is derived by internal valuation models to be based largely on unobservable inputs, which are Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 
  
   25 

The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

There were no maturities or transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company settled   $0.3 million   and   $89.3 million   of Level 3 liabilities in respect of the Loan Notes issued by Silverton for the   three and nine   months respectively, ended   September 30, 2016  .  As at   September 30, 2016  , there were no assets classified as Level 3 and the Company s Level 3 liabilities consisted solely of the Loan Notes issued by Silverton.  
  
   26 

There were no maturities, settlements or transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the twelve months ended   December 31, 2015  .  The Company settled   $67.8 million   of Level 3 liabilities in respect of the Loan Notes issued by Silverton for the twelve months ended   December 31, 2015  .  As at   December 31, 2015  , there were no assets classified as Level 3 and the Company s Level 3 liabilities consisted solely of the Loan Notes issued by Silverton.  
  
   27 

The following tables present a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)    The amount classified within accrued expenses and other payables was   $2.3 million   and   $87.6 million   as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Valuation of Fixed Income Securities  . The Company s fixed income securities are classified as either available for sale or trading and carried at fair value. As at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s fixed income securities were valued by pricing services, index providers or broker-dealers using standard market conventions. The market conventions utilize market quotations, market transactions in comparable instruments and various relationships between instruments including, but not limited to, yield to maturity, dollar prices and spread prices in determining value.  
  Independent Pricing Services and Index Providers.   The underlying methodology used to determine the fair value of securities in the Company s available for sale and trading portfolios by the pricing services and index providers the Company uses is very similar. Pricing services will gather observable pricing inputs from multiple external sources, including buy and sell-side contacts and broker-dealers, in order to develop their internal prices. Index providers are those firms which provide prices for a range of securities within one or more asset classes, typically using their own in-house market makers (traders) as the primary pricing source for the indices, although ultimate valuations may also rely on other observable data inputs to derive a dollar price for all index-eligible securities. Index providers without in-house trading desks will function similarly to a pricing service in that they will gather their observable pricing inputs from multiple external sources. All prices for the Company s securities attributed to index providers are for an individual security within the respective indices. 
  Pricing services and index providers provide pricing for less complex, liquid securities based on market quotations in active markets. Pricing services and index providers supply prices for a broad range of securities including those for actively traded securities, such as Treasury and other Government securities, in addition to those that trade less frequently or where valuation includes reference to credit spreads, pay down and pre-pay features and other observable inputs. These securities include Government Agency, Municipals, Corporate and Asset-Backed Securities. 
  For securities that may trade less frequently or do not trade on a listed exchange, these pricing services and index providers may use matrix pricing consisting of observable market inputs to estimate the fair value of a security. These observable market inputs include: reported trades, benchmark yields, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic factors. Additionally, pricing services and index providers may use a valuation model such as an option adjusted spread model commonly used for estimating fair values of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Neither the Company, nor its index providers, derives dollar prices using an index as a pricing input for any individual security. 
  Broker-Dealers.   The Company obtains quotes from broker-dealers who are active in the corresponding markets when prices are unavailable from independent pricing services or index providers. Generally, broker-dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable market inputs. Their pricing methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data, bids or offers, observed spreads and performance of newly issued securities. They may also establish pricing through observing secondary trading of similar securities. Quotes from broker-dealers are non-binding. 
  The Company obtains prices for all of its fixed income investment securities via its third-party accounting service provider, and in the majority of cases receiving a number of quotes so as to obtain the most comprehensive information  
  
   28 

available to determine a security s fair value. A single valuation is applied to each security based on the vendor hierarchy maintained by the Company s third-party accounting service provider. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company obtained an average of   2.3   quotes per fixed income investment, consistent with   2.0   quotes as at   December 31, 2015  . Pricing sources used in pricing fixed income investments as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

A summary of securities priced using pricing information from index providers as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is provided below:  

The Company, in conjunction with its third-party accounting service provider, obtains an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by the third-party pricing service and index provider to assess the ongoing appropriateness of vendors  prices. The Company and its third-party accounting service provider also have controls in place to validate that amounts provided represent fair values. Processes to validate and review pricing include, but are not limited to: 
             
    quantitative analysis (e.g., comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark, with significant differences identified and investigated); 
                
    comparison of market values obtained from pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers against alternative price sources for each security where further investigation is completed when significant differences exist for pricing of individual securities between pricing sources; 
                
    initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value; and 
                
    comparison of the fair value estimates to the Company s knowledge of the current market. 
     Prices obtained from pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers are not adjusted by us; however, prices provided by a pricing service, index provider or broker-dealer in certain instances may be challenged based on market or information available from internal sources, including those available to the Company s third-party investment accounting service provider. Subsequent to any challenge, revisions made by the pricing service, index provider or broker-dealer to the quotes are supplied to the Company s investment accounting service provider. 
  
   29 

Management reviews the vendor hierarchy maintained by the Company s third-party accounting service provider in order to determine which price source provides the most appropriate fair value (i.e., a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases). The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company s available for sale and trading portfolios is based upon its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation as of the measurement date. The hierarchy of index providers and pricing services is determined using various qualitative and quantitative points arising from reviews of the vendors conducted by the Company s third-party accounting service provider. Vendor reviews include annual onsite due diligence meetings with index providers and pricing services vendors covering valuation methodology, operational walkthroughs and legal and compliance updates. Index providers are assigned the highest priority in the pricing hierarchy due primarily to availability and reliability of pricing information. 
  Fixed Income Securities  . The Company s fixed income securities are traded on the over-the-counter ( OTC ) market based on prices provided by one or more market makers in each security. Securities such as U.S. Government, U.S. Agency, Foreign Government and investment grade corporate bonds have multiple market makers in addition to readily observable market value indicators such as expected credit spread, except for Treasury securities, over the yield curve. The Company uses a variety of pricing sources to value fixed income securities including those securities that have pay down/prepay features such as mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities in order to ensure fair and accurate pricing. The fair value estimates for the investment grade securities in the Company s portfolio do not use significant unobservable inputs or modeling techniques. 
  U.S. Government and Agency.   U.S. government and agency securities consist primarily of bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury and corporate debt issued by agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ) and the Federal Home Loan Bank. As the fair values of U.S. Treasury securities are based on unadjusted market prices in active markets, they are classified within Level 1. The fair values of U.S. government agency securities are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of U.S. government agency securities are classified within Level 2. 
  Municipals.   The Company s municipal portfolio comprises bonds issued by U.S. domiciled state and municipality entities. The fair value of these securities is determined using spreads obtained from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market which are Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Consequently, these securities are classified within Level 2. 
  Foreign Government.   The issuers for securities in this category are non-U.S. governments and their agencies. The fair values of non-U.S. government bonds, primarily sourced from international indices, are based on unadjusted market prices in active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1. The fair values of the non-U.S. agency securities, again primarily sourced from international indices, are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. As the yields for the risk-free yield curve and the spreads for these securities are observable market inputs, the fair values of non-U.S. agency securities are classified within Level 2. In addition, foreign government securities include a portion of the Emerging Market Debt ( EMD ) portfolio which is also classified within Level 2.  
  Corporate.   Corporate securities consist primarily of U.S. and foreign corporations covering a variety of industries and are for the most part priced by index providers and pricing vendors. Some issuers may participate in government programs which guarantee timely payment of principal and interest in the event of a default. The fair values of these securities are generally determined using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. Inputs used in the evaluation of these securities include credit data, interest rate data, market observations and sector news, broker-dealer quotes and trade volumes. In addition, corporate securities include a portion of the EMD portfolio. The Company classifies all of these securities within Level 2.  
  Mortgage-backed Securities.   The Company s residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities consist of bonds issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, the FNMA and the FHLMC as well as private non-agency issuers. The fair values of these securities are determined through the use of a pricing model (including Option Adjusted Spread) which uses prepayment speeds and spreads to determine the appropriate average life of the mortgage-backed security. These spreads are generally obtained from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. As the significant inputs used to price mortgage-backed securities are observable market inputs, these securities are classified within Level 2. 
  Asset-backed Securities.   The underlying collateral for the Company s asset-backed securities consists mainly of student loans, automobile loans and credit card receivables. These securities are primarily priced by index providers and pricing vendors. Inputs to the valuation process include broker-dealer quotes and other available trade information, prepayment speeds, interest rate data and credit spreads. The Company classifies these securities within Level 2. 
  Bank Loans.   These are variable rate, senior secured debt instruments issued by non-investment grade companies that are not publicly registered but are the most senior debt in a capital structure and are generally secured by company assets. Although these assets are not as liquid a market as traditional fixed income instruments, they are valued in similar fashion to other fixed maturities, using similar inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and credit spreads. These securities are primarily priced by a third-party pricing vendor. Bank loans are therefore classified within Level 2. 
  
   30 

Short-term Investments.   Short-term investments comprise highly liquid debt securities with a maturity greater than three months but less than one year from the date of purchase. Short-term investments are valued in a manner similar to the Company s fixed maturity investments and are classified within Levels 1 and 2. 
  Equity Securities.   Equity securities include U.S. and foreign common stocks and are classified either as trading or available for sale and carried at fair value. These securities are classified within Level 1 as their fair values are based on quoted market prices in active markets from independent pricing sources. As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company obtained an average of   3.9   quotes per equity investment, compared to   4.0   quotes as at   December 31, 2015  . Pricing sources used in pricing equities as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were all provided by index providers. 
  Catastrophe Bonds.   Catastrophe bonds held by the Company are variable rate fixed income instruments with redemption values adjusted based on the occurrence of a covered event, usually windstorms and earthquakes.  These bonds have been classified as trading and carried at fair value.  Bonds are priced using an average of multiple broker-dealer quotes and, as such, are classified as Level 2.   
  Foreign Exchange Contracts.   The foreign exchange contracts which the Company uses to mitigate currency risk are characterized as OTC due to their customized nature and the fact that they do not trade on a major exchange. These instruments trade in a deep liquid market, providing substantial price transparency and accordingly are classified as Level 2. 
  Interest Rate Swaps.   The interest rate swaps which the Company previously used to mitigate interest rate risk are also characterized as OTC and are valued by the counterparty using quantitative models with multiple market inputs. The market inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves, are observable and the valuation can be compared for reasonableness with third-party pricing services. Consequently, these instruments are classified as Level 2. 
  Loan Notes Issued by Variable Interest Entities  . Silverton, a licensed special purpose insurer, is consolidated into the Company s group accounts as a VIE.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, Silverton issued   $65.0   million (  $50.0   million third-party funded) of Loan Notes with a maturity date of September 16, 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Silverton issued an additional   $85.0 million   (  $70.0 million   third-party funded) of Loan Notes with a maturity date of September 18, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Silverton issued an additional   $125.0 million   (  $100.0 million   third-party funded) of Loan Notes with a maturity date of September 17, 2018. The Company elected to account for the Loan Notes at fair value using the guidance as prescribed under ASC 825,   Financial Instruments   as the Company believes it represents the most meaningful measurement basis for these liabilities.  The Loan Notes are recorded at fair value at each reporting period and, as they are not quoted on an active market and contain significant unobservable inputs, they have been classified as a Level 3 instrument in the Company s fair value hierarchy. The Loan Notes are unique because they are linked to the specific risks of the Company s property catastrophe book.  
  To determine the fair value of the Loan Notes the Company runs an internal model which considers the seasonality of the risk assumed under the retrocessional agreement between Aspen Bermuda and Aspen U.K., as ceding reinsurers, and Silverton.  The seasonality used in the model is initially determined by applying the percentage of property catastrophe losses planned by the Company s actuaries to the estimated written premium to determine earned premium for each quarter.  The initial assumptions of premiums and claims are then reviewed quarterly and updated based on actual premiums written and the latest estimate of claims experience.  The inputs to the internal model are based on Company specific data due to the lack of observable market inputs.  Reserves for losses are the most significant unobservable input.  An increase in reserves for losses would normally result in a decrease in the fair value of the Loan Notes while a decrease in reserves would normally result in an increase in the fair value of the Loan Notes.  The observable and unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the Loan Notes as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the tables below:  

31 

(1)    The amount classified within accrued expenses and other payables was   $2.3 million   and   $87.6 million   as at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  The observable and unobservable inputs represent the potential variation around the inputs used in the internal model. The contract period is defined in the respective Loan Notes agreements and the initial value represents the funds received from third parties.  

9.  
    Reinsurance 
     The Company purchases retrocession and reinsurance to limit and diversify the Company s risk exposure and increase its own insurance and reinsurance underwriting capacity. These agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses from reinsurers. As is the case with most reinsurance contracts, the Company remains liable to the extent that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under these agreements and therefore, in line with its risk management objectives, the Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk. The largest concentrations of reinsurance recoverables as at   September 30, 2016   were   19.1%   (  December 31, 2015        20.4%  ) with Munich Re which is rated AA- by S P,   18.1%   (  December 31, 2015       20.0%  ) with Lloyd s syndicates which are rated A+ by S P and   7.8%   (  December 31, 2015        9.2%  ) with Arch Re which is rated A+ by S P.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.   The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk. A foreign exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract. Foreign exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of the Company s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow it to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the Company held foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging under ASC 815 with an aggregate notional value of   $595.6 million   (  December 31, 2015       $379.9 million  ). The foreign exchange  
  
   33 

contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the impact of foreign exchange contracts on net income was a   gain   of   $0.6 million   (  September 30, 2015       gain   of   $12.9 million  ) and a   loss   of   $3.7 million   (  September 30, 2015       gain   of   $10.5 million  ), respectively. 
  The Company previously held foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedging under ASC 815.  The foreign exchange contracts were recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with the effective portion recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations.  On July 1, 2016 the Company removed the designation of the hedge and crystallized in other comprehensive income the foreign exchange loss recognized as at June 30, 2016.  As the foreign exchange contracts settle, this unrealized loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income into general, administrative and corporate expenses of the statement of operations and other comprehensive income.     
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amount recognized within general, administrative and corporate expenses for settled foreign exchange contracts was a realized   loss   of   $3.1 million   (  September 30, 2015       loss   of   $0.8 million  ) For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amount recognized within general, administrative and corporate expenses for settled foreign exchange contracts was a realized   loss   of   $5.6 million   (  September 30, 2015        loss   of   $3.5 million  ). 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional value of the contracts was   $28.6 million   (  December 31, 2015       $113.6 million  ).  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the movement in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion was a net unrealized   gain   of   $3.1 million   (  September 30, 2015       loss   of   $0.2 million  ). For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the movement in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion was a net unrealized   loss   of   $1.9 million   (  September 30, 2015       gain   of   $2.5 million  ). 
  Interest Rate Swaps.   In 2014, the Company decided to let its interest rate program roll-off and not renew maturing positions. This decision was made after an extensive reassessment of the costs of maintaining an interest rate swap program in a steep yield curve environment. In addition, the continued uncertainty in the global economy, weak oil prices and low inflation make it difficult to gauge the timing and speed of interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve. On May 9, 2016, the Company terminated all remaining outstanding interest rate swaps (notional value of   $256.3 million  ) under its International Swap Dealers Association agreement.  
  As at   September 30, 2016  , the total notional amount of the swaps was $  Nil   (  December 31, 2015       $756.3 million  ). For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   charge in respect of the interest rate swaps (  September 30, 2015       charge   of   $2.8 million  ) and for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   a   charge   of   $3.3 million   (  September 30, 2015       charge   of   $6.2 million  ). 
  As at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   cash collateral was held by the Company s counterparty (  December 31, 2015       $10.1 million  ). As at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   non-cash collateral was transferred to the Company by its counterparty (  December 31, 2015     $  Nil  ). Transfers of cash collateral are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet within Derivatives at Fair Value, while transfers in respect of non-cash collateral are disclosed but not recorded. As at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amount was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the pledged assets.

The following table provides a summary of the Company s authorized and issued share capital as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Additional paid-in capital as at   September 30, 2016   was   $1,280.2 million   (  December 31, 2015       $1,075.3 million  ). Additional paid-in capital includes the aggregate liquidation preferences of the Company s preference shares of   $818.2 million   (  December 31, 2015       $568.2 million  ) less issue costs of   $21.1 million   (  December 31, 2015       $12.4 million  ). 
  Ordinary Shares.   The following table summarizes transactions in the Company s ordinary shares during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Ordinary Share Repurchases  . On   February 5, 2015  , the Company and the Board of Directors agreed a new share repurchase authorization program of   $500.0 million  . The total share repurchase authorization, which was effective immediately through February 6, 2017, permits the Company to effect the repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions, including open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase transactions. 
  Under open market repurchases and pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, the Company acquired and cancelled for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     144,289   and   1,122,328   ordinary shares, respectively. The total consideration paid for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.5 million   and   $50.0 million  , respectively, with an average price per ordinary share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $45.17   and   $44.55  , respectively.  Under open market repurchases, the Company acquired and cancelled $  Nil   and   1,790,333   ordinary shares, respectively, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The total consideration paid for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was $  Nil   and   $83.7 million  , respectively, and the average price per ordinary share was $  Nil   and   $46.74  , respectively.  
  Preference Share Issuance.   On September 20, 2016, the Company issued   10,000,000   shares of   5.625%   Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (the    5.625%   Preference Shares ).  The   5.625%   Preference Shares have a liquidation preference of   $25   per share.  Net proceeds were   $241.3 million  , comprising   $250.0 million   of total liquidation preference less   $8.7 million    
  
   36 

of issuance expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to redeem, in whole or in part, the Company s outstanding   7.401%   Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares and   7.250%   Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares on January 1, 2017 and July 1, 2017, respectively. The   5.625%   Preference Shares rank equally with preference shares previously issued by the Company and have no fixed maturity date. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the   5.625%   Preference Shares at a redemption price of   $25   per share on or after January 1, 2027. The   5.625%   Preference Shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol  AHLPRD . 

14.  
    Share-Based Payments 
     The Company has issued options and other equity incentives under   three   arrangements: employee incentive plans, a non-employee director plan and employee share purchase plans. When options are exercised or other equity awards have vested, new ordinary shares are issued as the Company does not currently hold treasury shares. 
  Employee and Non-Employee Director Awards.   Employee options and other stock awards were granted under the Aspen 2003 Share Incentive Plan, as amended (the  2003 Share Incentive Plan ), prior to April 24, 2013 and thereafter under the  2013 Share Incentive Plan (the  2013 Share Incentive Plan ). The total number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2013 Share Incentive Plan is   2,845,683   ordinary shares, which includes   595,683   ordinary shares available to grant under the 2003 Share Incentive Plan as of February 25, 2013. The number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2013 Share Incentive Plan is adjusted per the number of awards that may be forfeited under the 2003 Share Incentive Plan.  The non-employee director awards were granted under the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors prior to April 21, 2016 and thereafter under the 2016 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the  2016 Non-Employee Director Plan ).  The total number of ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2016 Non-Employee Director Plan is   263,695  . 
  Employee stock options are granted with an exercise price equivalent to the fair value of the ordinary share on the grant date. The weighted average value at grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options typically vest over a   three  -year period with a   ten  -year exercise period with vesting dependent on time and performance conditions established at the time of grant.   No   stock options were granted during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015       Nil   and   Nil  ) and   Nil   and   29,222   options, respectively, were exercised and ordinary shares issued in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015       2,000   and   85,938   stock options).   No   charges against income were made in respect of stock options for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015     $  Nil   and $  Nil  ). 
  Restricted share units ( RSUs ) granted to employees typically vest over a   three  -year period based on continued service. Some of the RSUs vest at year-end, while others vest on the anniversary of the date of grant or when the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors agrees to deliver the RSUs. The fair value of the RSUs is based on the closing price on the date of the grant, adjusted for illiquidity, and is expensed through the income statement evenly over the vesting period. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted to its employees   35,852   and   328,551   RSUs, respectively  (  2015       11,614   and   253,766  ). Compensation costs charged against income in respect of employee RSUs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2.6 million   and   $7.2 million  , respectively (  2015       $2.1 million   and   $6.8 million  ). 
  In the case of non-employee directors, generally   one-twelfth   of the RSUs vest on each one month anniversary of the date of grant, with   100%   of the RSUs vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant. On February 4, 2016 (with a grant date of February 8, 2016), the Board of Directors approved a total of   24,456   RSUs for non-employee directors (February 9,   2015       27,620   RSUs) and   10,952   RSUs to the Chairman (February 9,   2015       12,154   RSUs). Compensation costs charged against income in respect of non-employee director RSUs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million  ). 
  The total fair value adjustment for all RSUs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively (  2015     $  Nil   and   $0.3 million  ). The total tax credit recognized by the Company in relation to RSUs in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.6 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.7 million   and   $1.4 million  ).  
  Performance Shares.   During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   Nil   and   278,477   performance shares, respectively, to its employees (  2015       Nil   and   277,585  ). The performance shares are subject to a   three  -year vesting period with a separate annual diluted book value per share ( BVPS ) growth test for each year, adjusted to add back ordinary dividends. One-third of the grant is eligible for vesting each year based on a formula and are the performance shares are only issuable at the end of the three-year period. 
    
  If the diluted BVPS growth achieved in   2016   is: 
             
    less than   4.65%  , then the portion of the performance shares subject to the vesting conditions in such year will be forfeited (i.e., one-third of the initial grant); 
     
   37 

between   4.65%   and   9.30%  , then the percentage of the performance shares eligible for vesting in such year will be between   10%   and   100%   on a straight-line basis; or 
        
  In calculating BVPS for   2016  , the entire movement in AOCI will be excluded. Interest rate movements and credit spread movements in AOCI can be fairly significant and impact growth in BVPS which management does not have any control over. The Compensation Committee will review the impact of any capital management actions undertaken during   2016  , including share repurchases and special dividends, and consider whether any further adjustments to growth in BVPS should be made in the context of such actions. The calculation of BVPS for   2016   will likewise exclude all transactional expenses incurred in connection with any transaction which, if consummated, would result in a change in control, including without limitation the cost of defending against any such transaction and any third-party legal and advisory costs. The Compensation Committee believes that it would not be appropriate for employees  performance-related compensation to be impacted by these costs. 
  The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting conditions for the   2017   and   2018   portions of the grant in such years taking into consideration the market conditions and the Company s business plans at the commencement of the years concerned. Notwithstanding the vesting criteria for each given year, if the shares eligible for vesting in   2017   and   2018   are greater than   100%   for the portion of such year s grant and the average diluted BVPS growth over such year and the preceding year is less than the average of the minimum vesting thresholds for such year and the preceding year, then only   100%   (and no more) of the ordinary shares that are eligible for vesting in such year shall vest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the judgment of the Compensation Committee the main reason for the BVPS metric in the earlier year falling below the minimum threshold is due to the impact of rising interest rates and bond yields, then the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, disapply this limitation on   100%   vesting.  
  The fair value of performance share awards is based on the value of the closing ordinary share price on the date of the grant adjusted for illiquidity less a deduction for expected dividends which would not accrue during the vesting period. Compensation costs charged against income in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in respect of performance shares were   $0.3 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively (  2015       $2.6 million   and   $4.8 million  ).  The total tax recognized by the Company in relation to performance shares in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was a tax credit of   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.6 million   and   $1.1 million  ).    
  Phantom Shares.   During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Compensation Committee approved the grant of   1,156   and   147,513   phantom shares, respectively, to its employees (  2015       Nil   and   135,651  ). The phantom shares are subject to a three-year vesting period with a separate annual diluted BVPS growth test for each year, in accordance with the test described above for the   2016   performance shares, with the difference being that any vested amount is paid in cash in lieu of ordinary shares. As ordinary shares are not issued, the phantom shares have no dilutive effect.  
  The fair value of the phantom shares is based on the closing ordinary share price on the date of the grant adjusted for illiquidity, less estimated dividends payable over the vesting period. The fair value is expensed through the consolidated income statement evenly over the vesting period, but as the payment to beneficiaries will ultimately be in cash rather than ordinary shares, an adjustment is required each quarter to revalue the accumulated liability to the balance sheet date fair value. Compensation costs charged against income in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in respect of phantom shares were   $0.2 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively (  2015       $1.4 million   and   $3.4 million  ) with a fair value adjustment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $2.5 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.2 million   and   $1.8 million  ). The total tax credit recognized by the Company in relation to phantom shares in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.1 million   and   $0.8 million  ).  
  Employee Share Purchase Plans.   On April 30, 2008, the shareholders of the Company approved the Employee Share Purchase Plan, the 2008 Sharesave Scheme and the International Employee Share Purchase Plan (collectively, the  ESPP ), which are implemented by a series of consecutive offering periods as determined by the Board of Directors. In respect of the Employee Share Purchase Plan and the International Employee Share Purchase Plan, employees can save up to   $500   per month over a   two  -year period, at the end of which they are eligible to purchase the Company s ordinary shares at a discounted price, subject to a further   one   year holding period. In respect of the 2008 Sharesave Scheme, employees can save up to    500   per month over a   three  -year period, at the end of which they are eligible to purchase the Company s ordinary shares at a discounted price.  Employees can purchase the Company s ordinary shares at a discounted price equivalent to eighty-five percent (  85%  ) of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the offering date which may be adjusted upon changes in capitalization of the Company. Under the ESPP,   189   and   13,342   ordinary shares, respectively, were exercised and issued during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015       264   and   54,940   shares). Compensation costs charged against income in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in respect of the ESPP were   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively (  2015       $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  ).

    Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
     The following table provides a summary of the Company s intangible assets for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

On January 19, 2016, Aspen U.S. Holdings acquired   100%   of the equity voting interest of AgriLogic, a specialist U.S. crop managing general agency business with an integrated agricultural consultancy, for an initial purchase price of   $53.0 million  .  In addition, the Company recognized   $14.1 million   of contingent consideration, with a total maximum payable of   $22.8 million  , subject to the future performance of the business and   $2.0 million   of ceding commission. The total consideration for the acquisition was   $69.1 million  . 
  A significant proportion of the acquired business was represented by intangible assets, specifically   $25.0 million   for agency relationships,   $4.0 million   for the right to use the AgriLogic trademark,   $2.9 million   for non-compete agreements,   $1.8 million   for the value of business acquired and   $1.0 million   for consultancy relationships.  In addition,   $12.0 million   of software was acquired and is recognized in the balance sheet under office properties and equipment along with   $0.3 million   of residual net assets.  The total net assets acquired of   $47.0 million   resulted in the Company recognizing a total of   $22.1 million   in goodwill for the acquisition of AgriLogic. 
  
   39 

License to use the  AgriLogic  Trademark.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company acquired the right to use the AgriLogic trademark in the United States. The Company valued the trademark at   $4.0 million   with an estimated economic useful life of   10   years. The Company will amortize the estimated value of the trademark over its estimated useful life. 
  Agency Relationships.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company valued the agency relationships at   $25.0 million   with an estimated economic useful life of   15   years. The Company will amortize the estimated value of the agency relationships over their estimated useful life. 
  Non-compete Agreements.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company valued the non-compete agreements at   $2.9 million   with an estimated economic useful life of   5   years.  The Company will amortize the estimated value of the non-compete agreements over their estimated useful life. 
  Value of Business Acquired.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company recognized a   $1.8 million   asset for value of business acquired ( VOBA ) consisting of the inforce unearned premium reserve and claims reserves at fair value.  The Company will amortize the VOBA in line with the unwinding of the acquired unearned premium balances and loss reserves.  Given the short tail nature of AgriLogic s business, the VOBA has been fully amortized in 2016. 
  Consulting Relationships.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company valued the consulting relationships at   $1.0 million   with an estimated economic useful life of   10   years. The Company will amortize the estimated value of the consulting relationships over their estimated useful life. 
  Goodwill.   As part of the acquisition of AgriLogic, the Company valued the goodwill at   $22.1 million  .  The goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and will be assessed for impairment annually.  
  Renewal Rights.   On September 22, 2016 the Company entered into a renewal rights agreement with Liberty Specialty Markets Limited ("LSML").  The Company valued the renewal rights at   $1.9 million   with an estimated economic useful life of   5 years  . The Company will amortize the estimated value of the renewal rights over the estimated useful life. 
  In addition to the intangible assets and goodwill associated with the AgriLogic acquisition and the renewal rights agreement with LSML, the Company has the following intangible assets from prior transactions. 
  License to use the  Aspen  Trademark.   On April 5, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Aspen (Actuaries and Pension Consultants) Plc to acquire the right to use the Aspen trademark in the United Kingdom. The consideration paid was approximately   $1.6 million  . As at   September 30, 2016  , the value of the license to use the Aspen trademark was   $1.6 million   (  December 31, 2015       $1.6 million  ). The trademark has an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
  Insurance Licenses.   The total value of the Company s licenses as at   September 30, 2016   was   $16.6 million   (  December 31, 2015       $16.6 million  ). This includes   $10.0 million   of acquired licenses held by AAIC,   $4.5 million   of acquired licenses held by Aspen Specialty and   $2.1 million   of acquired licenses held by Aspen U.K. The insurance licenses are considered to have an indefinite life and are not amortized. The licenses are tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
              (a) 
    Restricted assets 
     The Company is obliged by the terms of its contractual obligations to specific policyholders and by obligations to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in deposits and trust funds for the benefit of policyholders. 
  The following table details the forms and value of the Company s restricted assets as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

(2)   
    The comparative balance has been re-presented to reflect total restricted investable assets as a percent of investable assets. Investable assets comprise total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest, receivables for securities sold and payables for securities purchased. 
     Funds at Lloyd s.   AUL operates at Lloyd s as the corporate member for Syndicate 4711. Lloyd s determines Syndicate 4711 s required regulatory capital principally through the syndicate s annual business plan. Such capital, called Funds at Lloyd s, comprises cash and investments as at   September 30, 2016   in the amount of   $456.1 million   (  December 31, 2015       $436.8 million  ).  
  The amounts provided as Funds at Lloyd s are drawn upon and become a liability of the Company in the event Syndicate 4711 declares a loss at a level that cannot be funded from other resources, or if Syndicate 4711 requires funds to cover a short term liquidity gap. The amount which the Company provides as Funds at Lloyd s is not available for distribution to the Company for the payment of dividends. Aspen Managing Agency Limited, the managing agent to Syndicate 4711, is also required by Lloyd s to maintain a minimum level of capital which as at   September 30, 2016   was    0.4 million   (  December 31, 2015        0.4 million  ). This is not available for distribution by the Company for the payment of dividends. 
  Credit Facility.   On June 12, 2013, Aspen Holdings and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the  Borrowers ) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with various lenders and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent ( Barclays ), which amends and restates the credit agreement dated as of July 30, 2010 among Aspen Holdings, the Borrowers, various lenders and Barclays. The credit facility may be used primarily for letters of credit in connection with the Company s insurance and reinsurance businesses to finance its working capital needs and those of our subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes. Initial availability under the credit facility is   $200.0 million   and the Company has the option (subject to obtaining commitments from acceptable lenders) to increase the facility by up to   $100.0 million  . The facility will expire on June 12, 2017.   
  As at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. The fees and interest rates on the loans and the fees on the letters of credit payable by the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are based upon the credit ratings for the Company s long-term unsecured senior debt by S P and Moody s. In addition, the fees for a letter of credit vary based upon whether the applicable Borrower has provided collateral (in the form of cash or qualifying debt securities) to secure its reimbursement obligations with respect to such letter of credit. 
  Under the credit facility, the Company must not permit (a) consolidated tangible net worth to be less than approximately   $2,428.6 million   plus   50%   of consolidated net income and   50%   of aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuance by the Company of its capital stock, in each case after January 1, 2013, (b) the ratio of our total consolidated debt to the sum of such debt plus our consolidated tangible net worth to exceed   35%   or (c) any material insurance subsidiary to have a financial strength rating of less than B++ from A.M. Best. In addition, the credit facility contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as certain customary events of default, including with respect to a change in control. The various affirmative and negative covenants include, among others, covenants that, subject to various exceptions, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to: incur indebtedness; create or permit liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets; pay dividends or other distributions; purchase or redeem the Company s equity securities or those of its subsidiaries and make other restricted payments; make certain investments; agree with others to limit the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to pay dividends or other restricted payments or to make loans or transfer assets to the Company or another of its subsidiaries. In addition, the credit facility has customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control and cross-default to other debt agreements. The credit facility also contains customary provisions in respect of successor companies resulting from mergers and acquisitions assuming obligations thereunder.  
  On December 12, 2014, Aspen Holdings and the Borrowers entered into a first amendment to an amended and restated credit agreement, dated June 12, 2013, with various lenders and Barclays. Aspen Holdings has established, and may establish additional, special purpose entities that have issued or will issue insurance-linked securities to third-party investors (each, an  ILS Entity  and collectively, the  ILS Entities ). Accordingly, the amended and restated credit agreement was amended, among other things, to (i) exclude ILS Entities from the definition of  Subsidiary , (ii) permit the Borrowers to invest in ILS Entities and (iii) permit the Borrowers to engage in transactions with an ILS Entity. 
   Other Credit Facilities.   On June 30, 2016, Aspen Bermuda and Citibank Europe plc ( Citi Europe ) amended the committed letter of credit facility, dated June 30, 2012, as amended on June 30, 2014 (the  LOC Facility ).  The amendment to the LOC facility extends the term of the LOC Facility to June 30, 2018 and provides a maximum aggregate amount of up to   $550.0 million  . Under the LOC Facility, Aspen Bermuda will pay to Citi Europe (a) a letter of credit fee based on the available amounts of each letter of credit and (b) a commitment fee, which varies based upon usage, on the unutilized portion of the LOC Facility.  Aspen Bermuda will also pay interest on the amount drawn by any beneficiary under the LOC Facility at a rate per  
  
   41 

annum of LIBOR plus   1%   (plus reserve asset costs, if any) from the date of drawing until the date of reimbursement by Aspen Bermuda. In addition, Aspen Bermuda and Citi Europe entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility whereby Aspen Bermuda has the ability to request letters of credit under this facility subject to the prior approval of Citi Europe. The fee associated with the uncommitted facility is a letter of credit fee based on the available amounts of each letter of credit issued under the uncommitted facility. Both the LOC Facility and the uncommitted facility are used to secure obligations of Aspen Bermuda to its policyholders. In addition to these facilities, we also use regulatory trusts to secure our obligations to policyholders.   
  In addition, Aspen U.K. and Aspen Bermuda had a   $100.0 million   secured letter of credit facility agreement with Barclays. All letters of credit issued under the facility were used to support reinsurance obligations of the parties to the agreement and their respective subsidiaries. The Company did not extend the maturity date of the Barclays secured letter of credit facility and, as a result, it expired on January 31, 2015 and no new letters of credit can be issued under this facility. As at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had   no   outstanding collateralized letters of credit under this facility. 
  For further information relating to the Company s credit facilities, refer to Note 23 of the  Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Interest Rate Swaps.   As at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   cash collateral was held by the Company s counterparties to support the current valuation of the interest rate swaps (  December 31, 2015       $10.1 million  ). For more information on the Company s terminated interest rate swaps, refer to Note 10 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
           (b) 
    Operating leases 
     Amounts outstanding under operating leases net of subleases as at   September 30, 2016   were: 

(c) 
    Contingent liabilities 
     In common with the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry, the Company is subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. The Company s Operating Subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the investigation, conduct and defense of disputes, or potential disputes, resulting from questions of insurance or reinsurance coverage or claims activities. Pursuant to insurance and reinsurance arrangements, many of these disputes are resolved by arbitration or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Such legal proceedings are considered in connection with estimating the Company s Insurance Reserves   Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses, as provided on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.   
  In some jurisdictions, notably the U.S., a failure to deal with such disputes or potential disputes in an appropriate manner could result in an award of  bad faith  punitive damages against the Company s Operating Subsidiaries. In accordance with ASC 450-20-50-4b, for (a) reasonably possible losses for which no accrual is made because any of the conditions for accrual in ASC 450-20-25-2 are not met and (b) reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued pursuant to ASC 450-20-30-1, the Company will provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. 
  As at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , based on available information, it was the opinion of the Company s management that the probability of the ultimate resolution of pending or threatened litigation or arbitrations having a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity would be remote.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as well as the discussions of critical accounting policies, contained in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and in  Outlook and Trends  below, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section captioned  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this report and the  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements contained in this discussion and analysis. 
  Overview 
  We are a Bermuda holding company and write insurance and reinsurance business through our subsidiaries principally in Bermuda, the United Kingdom and the United States.  
  Key results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include: 
             
    Gross written premiums of   $763.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   6.0%   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . Gross written premiums in reinsurance   increased   by   15.6%   with the increase largely due to growth in agriculture business written within the specialty reinsurance business line. Gross written premiums in insurance   decreased   by   1.6%   mainly due to reductions in global casualty and U.S. casualty business lines as we reposition the account; 
                
    There were   $24.9 million  , or   3.7   combined ratio points, of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   $19.1 million  , or   3.0   combined ratio points, of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries in the   third   quarter of   2015  ; 
                
    Net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of   $35.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   had a favorable impact of   5.2   percentage points on the combined ratio, compared with a reserve release of   $39.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , which had a favorable impact of   6.1   percentage points on the combined ratio; 
                
    Combined ratio of   93.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with a combined ratio of   93.4%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The increase in combined ratio is mainly due to a   $5.8 million   increase in catastrophe losses and a   $3.6 million   reduction in net favorable development on prior year loss reserves; 
                
    Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains of   $10.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with losses of   $8.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   predominantly due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. Dollar; 
                
    Realized and unrealized investment     gains     of     $21.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   losses   of   $41.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   gains   in the current quarter were due to mark to market changes in the valuation of our equity and fixed income trading portfo  lios;       
                
    Diluted net   income   per ordinary share of   $1.40   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared with diluted net income per ordinary share of   $0.30       in the   third   quarter last year; 
                
    Annualized net income return on average ordinary shareholders' equity of   11.2%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   2.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  ; and 
                
    Diluted book value per ordinary share   (1)    of   $50.49   as at   September 30, 2016  , up   9.8%   from   December 31, 2015  , which included net unrealized losses on foreign currency translation, net of taxes, and net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, recognized through other comprehensive income of   $19.3 million   and   $92.9 million  , respectively. 

43 

(1)    Diluted book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders  equity less preference shares (liquidation preference less issue expenses) and non-controlling interest, divided by the total number of issued and potentially dilutive ordinary shares at the end of the period. 
    
  Total shareholders  equity increased by   $287.3 million   to   $3,904.1 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The most significant movements were: 
             
    a   $25.2 million     reduction   in accumulated other comprehensive income mainly due to a   $21.2 million   net unrealized   loss   in the available for sale investment portfolio, a net unrealized   loss   in foreign currency translation of   $6.5 million   and a   $2.5 million   net   gain   on foreign exchange contracts;  
                 
    a   $73.0 million     increase   in retained earnings for the period; and 
      Ordinary shareholders  equity as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was: 

Outlook and Trends  
    
  Overall, the rate environment continues to pose challenges in both our reinsurance and insurance segments, although the rate impact varies by line and geography.  
    
  We successfully integrated AgriLogic and are delighted with its growth trajectory. We expect healthy growth across all U.S. states where we have already established a strong presence and, at this stage, indications are that 2016 should be a good year in terms of underwriting experience for the agriculture industry.  Across other lines, attractive opportunities continue to be brought to us despite the challenging market environment.  The pace of rate reductions in reinsurance slowed to approximately 4% for the year to date.  We achieved rate increases in the United States following some small natural catastrophe losses and in the Middle East following a degree of market disruption. Our reinsurance team continues to stay disciplined and avoids writing business that does not meet our underwriting targets.  
    
  In insurance, the pace of rate reductions also decreased to approximately 1% overall with pricing in the United States flat compared to international markets where rates decreased approximately 3%.  We continue to proactively manage our diversified insurance business lines and selectively reduce exposure in areas where rates are under pressure and to not renew some business in favor of other opportunities with more attractive prospective margins. We expect the benefits from this effort will improve our insurance loss ratio and decrease volatility in 2017 and more significantly in 2018. This transformation is already showing results, with growth and improved profitability in target areas. For example, our global accident and health business continued to perform well, along with surety and cyber. In our marine, aviation and energy sub-segment, we saw growth for the first time in many quarters. However, we remain cautious with marine and energy business as market conditions continue to be pressured. In property and casualty, our U.K. property and casualty business continued its strong track record of profitability and we generated growth from our railroad and U.K. regional business lines.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the selection of accounting policies and require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Some of the more critical judgments in the areas of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations are related to insurance reserves, premiums receivable in respect of assumed reinsurance, the fair value of derivatives and the value of investments, including the extent of any other-than-temporary impairment. There have been no changes to significant accounting policies from those disclosed in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. For a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the notes to the consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements contained in this report.  
   
  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , starting with a summary of our consolidated results and followed by a segmental analysis. 
  Total Income Statement 
  Our statements of operations consolidate the underwriting results of our two business segments and include certain other revenue and expense items that are not allocated to business segments. 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums   increased   by   $43.0 million  , or   6.0%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
  Gross written premiums from our reinsurance segment   increased   by   $49.3 million  , or   15.6%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the third quarter of 2015. The increase was largely due to growth in agriculture business written within specialty reinsurance following our recent acquisition of AgriLogic, a specialist U.S. crop managing general agency business with an integrated agricultural consultancy. This growth was offset by a   decrease   in other property premiums due to adverse contract adjustments and the non-renewal of certain contracts which did not meet our underwriting targets and a   decrease   in property catastrophe premiums due to contracts renewing in the second quarter of this year which previously renewed in the third quarter.  
  Gross written premiums from our insurance segment   decreased   by   $6.3 million  , or   1.6%  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the third quarter of 2015 largely due to reductions in global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. professional business lines as we reposition the account, partially offset by growth in our U.S. based ocean cargo, accident and health and U.S. surety business lines and favorable contract adjustments in our marine liability business line.  
  The table below shows our gross written premiums for each business segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each business segment: 

Ceded reinsurance.   Total reinsurance ceded of   $125.1 million     increased   by   $56.4 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015   due to increased ceded reinsurance for our U.S. inland marine, ocean cargo, U.S. excess casualty, property catastrophe business lines and additional ceded reinsurance for our new agriculture business reported in our specialty reinsurance business line. The changes in our reinsurance program have reduced our retention ratio, defined as net written premium as a percentage of gross written premium, by   6.9%   to   83.6%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   90.5%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Net premiums earned.   Net premiums earned in the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   by   6.3%   from the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Net premiums earned increased by   11.1%   and   2.4%   in reinsurance and insurance, respectively.  
  
   45 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio for the quarter     increased     0.1   percentage points from   57.1%   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   57.2%   largely due to a   $5.8 million   increase in catastrophe losses and a   $3.6 million   reduction in prior-year reserve releases. 
  In the reinsurance segment, the loss ratio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   56.5%   compared to   59.7%   in the equivalent period in   2015  . The   decrease   in the loss ratio in the quarter is largely attributable to the lack of significant large losses in the quarter compared with   $27.0 million of losses associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China   in the   third   quarter of   2015   partially offset by changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios.  Catastrophe losses decreased by   $2.0 million   and prior year reserve releases decreased by   $4.0 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we experienced   $14.8 million   of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including   $10.3 million   from   weather-related events in the U.S.   and   $3.4 million   from a hailstorm in the Netherlands. The comparable quarter of   2015   experienced   $16.8 million   of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $7.0 million from the wildfires in the U.S. State of Washington and $9.8 million of other losses associated with an earthquake in Chile and weather-related events in the U.S., New Zealand and Australia. Reserve releases for the current quarter were as a result of favorable development across all of our reinsurance business lines. The comparative period benefited from favorable reserve development in U.S. casualty and property pro rata business lines. 
  In the insurance segment, the loss ratio of   57.7%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased from   55.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2015   largely due to a   $7.8 million   increase in catastrophe losses, a   $7.6 million   decrease in prior year reserve release and higher U.S. casualty losses offset by a reduction in large losses.  We experienced   $10.1 million   of natural catastrophe losses in the period and   $2.3 million   in the comparative period primarily due to U.S. weather-related events.  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we experienced no significant large losses while in the comparative period in   2015   we experienced $11.2 million of mid-sized fire and energy losses in addition to $3.0 million of losses from the port explosion in Tianjin, China. Prior year reserve releases   decrease  d from   $22.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $15.3 million   in the current period. Reserve releases in the current quarter were mainly as a result of favorable development in our marine, aviation and energy and financial and professional business lines. Reserve releases in the comparative quarter were principally from our property and casualty lines. Further information relating to the movement of prior year reserves is found below under  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.  
  We monitor the ratio of losses and LAE to net earned premium (the  loss ratio ) as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio. The loss ratios for our two business segments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

The tables below show our loss ratios including and excluding the impact from natural catastrophe losses to aid in the analysis of the underlying performance of our business segments. For this purpose, we have defined   third   quarter   2016   catastrophe losses as losses associated with weather-related events in the U.S. and a hailstorm in the Netherlands.  We have defined catastrophe losses in the   third   quarter of   2015   as losses largely associated with wildfires in the U.S. State of Washington, an earthquake in Chile and weather-related events in the U.S, New Zealand and Australia. 
  The underlying changes in loss ratios by business segment are shown in the tables below for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The total loss ratio represents the calendar year U.S. GAAP loss ratio. The current year adjustments represent the effect on the loss ratio of net losses and reinstatement premiums, if any, from catastrophe loss events.

For information relating to the movement of prior year reserves, please see  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  below. 
  Expense ratio.   We monitor the ratio of expenses to net earned premium (the  expense ratio ) as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, general, administrative and corporate expenses. The table below splits the net expense ratio between the amortized deferred policy acquisition costs, general, administrative and corporate expenses and the effect of reinsurance for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    The total group general and administrative expense ratio includes corporate expenses which are not allocated to the segments. 
     The policy acquisition expense ratio decreased in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the equivalent quarter of   2015   due to a reduction in the reinsurance segment ratio partially offset by an increase in the insurance segment ratio.  The increase in the insurance segment ratio is largely due to lower over-rider commissions.  The decrease in the reinsurance segment policy acquisition expense ratio was largely due to changes in business mix toward agriculture as a result of our acquisition of AgriLogic which has lower average commission rates and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average commission rates. 
  General, administrative and corporate expenses   increased   by   $24.5 million   from   $100.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $125.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   largely driven by costs following our acquisition of AgriLogic in addition to reorganization costs and other planned expenses to support the growth in our business.  The general, administrative and corporate expense ratio, before the effect of reinsurance,   increased   by   1.0   percentage point in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the equivalent period in 2015. 
  Net investment income.   Net investment income for the quarter of   $46.4 million     increased   by   3.1%   compared to   $45.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   due to an increase in dividend income and a reduction in investment expenses. 
  Change in fair value of derivatives.   In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded no change in the fair value of our terminated interest rate swaps (  2015       loss   of   $2.8 million  ), a   gain   of   $0.6 million   (  2015       gain   of   $12.9 million  ) in respect of foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments and a   loss   of   $3.1 million   (  2015       loss   of   $0.8 million  ) in respect of foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments. 
  
   47 

Income before tax.   In the   third   quarter of   2016  , income before tax was   $100.5 million   (  2015       $30.0 million  ) comprised of the amounts set out in the table below: 

Taxes.   Income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.9 million   (  2015       $1.8 million  ) equating to an estimated effective tax rate of   4.9%   (  2015       6.0%  ). The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an agreement with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") of the deductions available for certain interest payments in prior periods.  The effective tax rate for the year is subject to revision in future periods if circumstances change and depends on the relative profitability of those parts of business underwritten in Bermuda (where the rate of tax on corporate profits is zero), the United Kingdom (where the corporate tax rate remains at 20%, with a further reduction to 19% from April 1, 2017 and 17% from April 1, 2020) and the United States (where the federal income tax rate is 35%).  
  Net income after tax.   Net income after tax for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $95.6 million  , equivalent to basic earnings per ordinary share of   $1.43   adjusted for the   $9.5 million   preference share dividends and   $0.2 million   non-controlling interest. Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were   $1.40   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net income after tax for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $28.2 million  , equivalent to basic earnings per ordinary share of   $0.30   after deducting   $9.5 million   preference share dividends and   $0.3 million   non-controlling interest. Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were   $0.30   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Realized and unrealized   investment   gains/(losses)  . Total realized and unrealized investment   gains   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $21.5 million   (  2015       loss   of   $41.2 million  ) comprising the amounts set out in the table below:   

48 

Other comprehensive income.   We recorded a   $25.2 million     reduction   in our total other comprehensive income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (  2015       reduction   of   $4.9 million  ), net of taxes. The   reduction   was mainly due to a   $16.8 million     loss   in the net unrealized available for sale investment portfolio (  2015       $25.3 million   net unrealized   gain  ), a   $6.5 million   net unrealized   loss   in foreign currency translation (  2015       $27.9 million   net unrealized   loss  ), a   $2.5 million   net   gain   from hedged foreign exchange contracts (  2015       $0.2 million     loss  ) and a   $4.4 million   reclassification of net realized   gains   to net income (  2015       $1.8 million   reclassified net realized   gains  ). 
  Non-controlling interest.   In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   decrease   of   $0.2 million   (  2015       $0.3 million     increase  ) in the amount owed to the non-controlling interest in respect of Aspen Risk Management Limited. 
  Dividends.   Dividends paid on our ordinary shares and preference shares in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $22.8 million   (  2015       $22.2 million  ). The dividend on our ordinary shares increased from $0.21 per ordinary share to $0.22 per ordinary share on April 21, 2016.  
   
  Underwriting Results by Business Segments         Third   Quarter 
  We are organized into two business segments: Reinsurance and Insurance. The reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe reinsurance, other property reinsurance, casualty reinsurance and specialty reinsurance. The insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. 
  We have provided additional disclosures for corporate and other (non-underwriting) income and expenses in Note 5 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Corporate and other income and expenses include net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses, expenses associated with managing the group, certain strategic and non-recurring costs, changes in fair value of derivatives and changes in fair value of the loan notes issued by variable interest entities, interest expenses, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes, none of which are allocated to the business segments. 
  Please refer to the tables in Note 5 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of gross and net written and earned premiums, underwriting results and combined ratios and reserves for our two business segments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The contributions of each business segment to gross written premiums in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Reinsurance 
  Our reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe reinsurance, other property reinsurance (risk excess, pro rata and facultative), casualty reinsurance (U.S. treaty, international treaty and global facultative) and specialty reinsurance (credit and surety, agriculture insurance and reinsurance, marine, aviation, terrorism, engineering and other specialty lines). For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1,  Business   Business Segments   Reinsurance  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment   increased   by   15.6%   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business:    

49 

The   decrease   in property catastrophe gross written premiums was primarily due to contracts renewing in the second quarter of this year which renewed in the third quarter last year. The   decrease   in other property reinsurance was largely due to adverse contract adjustments and the non-renewal of certain contracts which did not meet our underwriting targets. Our casualty reinsurance marginally increased due to growth in our international casualty business line. The   increase   in our specialty reinsurance business was largely due to $103.3 million of   agriculture business sourced following our recent acquisition of AgriLogic   offset by reductions in our credit and surety and specialty marine business lines. 
  Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   56.5%   compared to   59.7%   in the equivalent period in   2015  . The   decrease   in the loss ratio in the quarter is largely attributable to no significant large losses in the quarter compared with $27.0 million of losses associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China in the third quarter of 2015 partially offset by changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios. 
  We experienced a   $2.0 million   decrease in catastrophe losses and a   $4.0 million   decrease in prior year reserve releases compared to the same period in 2015. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we experienced   $14.8 million   of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including   $10.3 million   from weather-related events in the U.S. and   $3.4 million   from a hailstorm in the Netherlands. The comparable quarter of   2015   experienced   $16.8 million   of natural catastrophe losses including $7.0 million from the wildfires in the U.S. State of Washington and $9.8 million of other losses associated with the earthquake in Chile and weather-related events in the U.S., New Zealand and Australia. Reserve releases for the current quarter were as a result of favorable development across all of our reinsurance business lines. The comparative period in 2015 benefited from favorable reserve development in U.S. casualty and property pro rata business lines. Further information relating to the movement of prior year reserves is found below under  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.  
  Policy acquisition, general and administrative expenses.   Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was $  53.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , equivalent to   16.8%   of net premiums earned, compared to $  64.8 million  , or   22.8%   of net premiums earned in the equivalent period in   2015  .  The reduction in the acquisition expense ratio was largely due to changes in business mix toward agriculture and specialty marine business lines which have lower average commission rates and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average commission rates.  The general and administrative expenses of   $47.4 million     increased   compared to   $34.7 million   in the equivalent period in   2015   due to costs following our acquisition of AgriLogic in addition to other planned expenses to support business growth while the equivalent period in   2015   reported a reduction in performance-related accruals. The general and administrative expense ratio   increased   to   15.0%   from   12.2%   in the same period in   2015   due to the increase in expenses noted above together with the impact of an increase in ceded premiums which reduced the growth in net premiums earned. 
  Insurance 
  Our insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1  Business   Business Segments   Insurance  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums in our insurance segment   decreased   by   1.6%   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business: 

The   decrease   in property and casualty gross written premiums is largely attributable to reductions in global casualty and U.S. casualty business lines as we reposition the account. The   increase   in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance is largely attributable to growth in our new U.S. based ocean cargo business line and favorable contract adjustments in our marine liability business line. The   increase   in gross written premiums in financial and professional insurance is largely attributable to growth in our accident and health and U.S. surety insurance business lines offset by reductions in our U.S. professional business lines. 
  Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio of   57.7%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased from   55.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2015   largely due to a   $7.8 million   increase in catastrophe losses, a   $7.6 million   decrease in prior year reserve releases and higher U.S. casualty losses offset by a reduction in large losses. The insurance segment experienced catastrophe  
  
   50 

losses for U.S. weather-related events in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 of   $10.1 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we experienced no significant large losses while in the comparative period in 2015 we experienced $11.2 million of mid-sized fire and energy losses in addition to $3.0 million of losses from the port explosion in Tianjin, China.  
  Prior year reserve releases   decrease  d from   $22.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $15.3 million   in the third quarter of 2016. Reserve releases in the third quarter of 2016 were mainly as a result of favorable development in our marine, aviation and energy and financial and professional business lines. Reserve releases in the comparative quarter were principally from our property and casualty lines. Further information relating to the movement of prior year reserves is found below under  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.  
  Policy acquisition, general and administrative expenses.   Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   to   21.4%   of net premiums earned compared to   18.9%   in the   third   quarter of   2015   due largely to lower over-rider commissions.  Our general and administrative expenses   increased   by   $6.6 million   from   $51.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $57.9 million   in the current quarter   due to reorganization costs and costs associated with growth in our insurance business  .

Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  The following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , starting with a summary of our consolidated results and followed by a segmental analysis. 
  Total Income Statement 
  Our statements of operations consolidate the underwriting results of our two business segments and include certain other revenue and expense items that are not allocated to our business segments. 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums   increased   by   $178.4 million  , or   7.6%  , in   the first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Gross written premiums from our reinsurance segment   increased   by   14.5%   in the first nine months of 2016 largely due to growth in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines.  The   increase   in our specialty reinsurance business is due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic and growth in specialty marine business.  The   increase   in our casualty reinsurance lines of business is largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines.  
  Gross written premiums from our insurance segment   increased   by   1.9%   in the first nine months of 2016 mainly due to growth in our financial and professional lines offset by a reduction in our property and casualty insurance and marine, aviation and energy insurance lines. The   increase   in gross written premiums in financial and professional insurance was largely attributable to growth in our accident and health, credit and political risks, management liability and financial institutions business lines. The   decrease   in gross written premiums in property and casualty insurance was largely attributable to reductions in our global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. environmental business lines offset by growth in our U.S. excess casualty and railroad insurance business lines. The   decrease   in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely due to challenging market conditions in our marine and energy liability, U.S. inland marine, offshore energy, and energy and construction insurance business lines offset by growth in our ocean cargo and aviation insurance business line.  
  The table below shows our gross written premiums for each business segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each business segment:       

  Ceded reinsurance.   Total reinsurance ceded for   the first nine months   of   2016   of   $378.0 million     increased   by   $74.9 million   compared to   the first nine months   of   2015  .  Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased ceded reinsurance for our property catastrophe business line due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs and for our new agriculture business reported in our specialty reinsurance business line. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our insurance segment due to increased ceded reinsurance in our marine, aviation and energy and financial and professional business lines. Our retention ratio, defined as net written premium as a percentage of gross written premium, decreased by   1.0%   to   82.4%   in   the first nine months   of   2016   compared to   83.4%   in   the first nine months   of   2015  . 
  Net premiums earned.   Net premiums earned in the first   nine   months of   2016     increased   by   9.8%   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due to an   increase   in gross written premiums partially offset by higher ceded premiums. 
  Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio   increased   by   2.7   percentage points from   56.0%   in the first   nine   months of   2015   to   58.7%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  .  
  In the reinsurance segment, the loss ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   55.2%   compared to   48.8%   in the equivalent period in   2015   largely due to a $50.3 million increase in catastrophe losses, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios and a   $1.3 million   reduction in reserve releases, offset by lower large losses. In   the first nine months   of   2016  , we experienced $77.2 million of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $35.9 million   associated with the wildfires in Canada  ,   $26.0 million   from   weather-related events in the U.S.  ,   $7.5 million   from an earthquake in Japan,   $3.4 million   from a hailstorm in the Netherlands and   $2.2 million   from an earthquake in Taiwan.  
  
   52 

In the comparable period in   2015   we experienced   $26.9 million   of natural catastrophe losses, including $7.0 million from the wildfires in the U.S. State of Washington and $18.9 million of other losses associated with an earthquake in Chile and weather-related events in the U.S., Europe, New Zealand and Australia. Reserve releases decreased from   $53.4 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $52.1 million   in the current period. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   there were no significant large losses compared with $27.0 million of losses associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China in the equivalent period of 2015. 
  In the insurance segment, the loss ratio of   61.5%   for   the first nine months   of   2016   was the same as the comparable period in   2015   largely due to higher catastrophe losses and a reduction in reserve releases, offset by a reduction in large losses. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , there were   $34.6 million   of catastrophe losses associated with U.S. weather-related events compared to   $17.6 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015  .  Large losses in   the first nine months   of   2016   included   $29.6 million   of   energy-related losses  ,   $11.8 million   of   fire-related losses   and a   $4.2 million     aviation loss  . In the comparative period of   2015  , large losses included $23.6 million from fire and   weather-related events in the U.S.  , $37.6 million of energy-related losses, $5.0 from a train derailment and $3.0 million of losses from the port explosion in Tianjin, China.  Prior year reserve releases decreased by   $18.1 million   from   $44.2 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $26.1 million   in the equivalent period in 2016. The reserve releases in the   nine  -month period were principally from our marine, aviation and energy lines, most notably our energy physical damage, which offset adverse development in our property and casualty lines of business. The release in the comparative period in   2015   was due primarily from our property and casualty lines, most notably excess casualty, U.K. commercial and U.S. property business lines offsetting adverse development in our marine, aviation and energy lines of business.  
  We monitor the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio. The loss ratios for our two business segments for   the nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

We also present, in the tables below, loss ratios including and excluding the impact from natural catastrophe losses to aid in the analysis of the underlying performance of our business segments. For this purpose, we defined the major   2016   catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2016 as losses   associated with the wildfires in Canada  ,   weather-related events in the U.S.  , a hailstorm in the Netherlands and several earthquakes. We defined major   2015   catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2015 as losses associated with storms in the U.S., Europe, New Zealand and Australia, the Chilean earthquake and wildfires in the U.S.  
  The underlying changes in loss ratios by business segment are shown in the tables below for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The total loss ratio represents the calendar year U.S. GAAP loss ratio. The current year adjustments represent the effect on the loss ratio of net claims and reinstatement premiums, if applicable, from catastrophe loss events.

Reserve releases in our reinsurance segment decreased from   $53.4 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $52.1 million   in the equivalent period in 2016. Reserve releases in the insurance segment reduced from   $44.2 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $26.1 million   in   the first nine months   of   2016  .  Refer to  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  below for a description of the key elements giving rise to these reserve releases. 
  Expense ratio.   We monitor the expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and, general, administrative and corporate expenses. The table below splits the net expense ratio between the amortized deferred policy acquisition costs, general, administrative and corporate expenses and the effect of reinsurance for each of   the nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    The total group general and administrative expense ratio includes corporate expenses which are not allocated to the segments. 
     Policy acquisition expenses   increased   by   $22.4 million   in   the first nine months   of   2016   compared with the equivalent period in   2015   due to an increases in business written.  The reduction in the policy acquisition ratio, before the effect of reinsurance, is due to a change in the mix of business written in the reinsurance segment as a result of our acquisition of AgriLogic and the receipt of FET refunds, offset by lower over-rider commissions. 
  General, administrative and corporate expenses   increased   by   $63.1 million   in   the first nine months   of   2016   compared to   the first nine months   of   2015  .  The general, administrative and corporate expense ratio, before the effect of reinsurance,   increased   by   1.0   percentage point compared to the prior period in 2015 due to an increase in costs in our reinsurance segment as a result of our acquisition of AgriLogic and increased corporate costs associated with the growth in our business and reorganization costs. 
  Net investment income.   Net investment income for   the first nine months   of   2016   was   $143.9 million  , an   increase   of   3.5%   compared to   $139.1 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   due primarily to an increase in interest income from our larger fixed income portfolio, growth in equity dividends and a reduction in investment expenses. 
  Change in fair value of derivatives.   In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   charge   of   $3.3 million   (  2015       charge   of   $6.2 million  ) in respect of our terminated interest rate swaps and a   loss   of   $3.7 million   (  2015       gain   of   $10.5 million  ) in respect of foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments and a   loss   of   $5.6 million   (  2015       loss   of   $3.5 million  ) in respect of foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments. 
  
   54 

Income before tax.   In   the nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , income before tax was   $283.6 million   (  2015       $214.3 million  ) comprising the amounts set out in the table below: 

In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net change in gross realized and unrealized gains of   $103.3 million   driven primarily by mark to market gains in both our fixed income and equity portfolios. 
  Taxes.   Income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.7 million   (  2015       $9.1 million  ) equating to an estimated effective tax rate of   3.1%   (  2015       4.2%  ). The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an agreement with HMRC of the deductions available for certain interest payments in prior periods. The effective tax rate represents an estimate of the tax rate which will apply to our pre-tax income for   2016   including adjustments to prior period estimates. The effective tax rate for the year is subject to revision in future periods if circumstances change and depends on the relative profitability the business underwritten in Bermuda (where the rate of tax on corporate profits is zero), the U.K. (where the corporate tax rate remains at 20%, with a further reduction to 19% from April 1, 2017 and 17% from April 1, 2020) and the U.S. (where the federal income tax rate is 35%).    
  Net income after tax.   Net income after tax for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $274.9 million  , equivalent to basic earnings per share of   $4.07   adjusted for the   $28.4 million   preference share dividends and $  nil   non-controlling interest. Net income after tax for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $205.2 million  , equivalent to basic earnings per ordinary share of   $2.86  , adjusted for the   $28.4 million   preference share dividends and   $0.8 million   of non-controlling interest.  Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were   $3.97   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.80   for the equivalent period in   2015  .

Investment gains  . Realized and unrealized investment gains for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $103.3 million   (  2015       $13.6 million   loss) comprising the amounts set out in the table below:    

In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net change in gross unrealized gains of   $89.8 million   driven by mark to market gains in both our fixed income and equity portfolios. 
  Other-than-temporary impairments.   A security is impaired when its fair value is below its amortized cost. We review our aggregate investment portfolio, including equities, on an individual security basis for potential OTTI each quarter based on criteria including issuer-specific circumstances, credit ratings actions and general macro-economic conditions. The total OTTI charge for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $  Nil  . For a more detailed description of OTTI, please refer to Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Other comprehensive income.   We recorded an   increase   in our total other comprehensive income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $72.3 million   (  2015       reduction   of   $120.7 million  ), net of taxes. This is comprised of a   $102.0 million   net unrealized   gain   on the available for sale investment portfolio (  2015       $19.6 million   net unrealized   loss  ), a   $9.1 million   reclassification of net realized   gains   to net income (  2015       $33.1 million   reclassified net realized   gains  ), a net unrealized   loss   in foreign currency translation of   $19.3 million   (  2015       $70.2 million   net unrealized   loss  ) and a net unrealized   loss   on hedged derivative contracts of   $1.3 million   (  2015       gain   of   $2.2 million  ). 
  Non-controlling interest.   In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in the amount owed to the non-controlling interest in respect of Aspen Risk Management Limited, our U.K. regional property and casualty subsidiary was $Nil (  2015       increase   of   $0.8 million  ). 
  Dividends.   The dividend on our ordinary shares increased from $0.21 per ordinary share to $0.22 per ordinary share on April 21, 2016. The dividend on our ordinary shares increased from $0.20 per ordinary share to $0.21 per ordinary share on April 22, 2015. Dividends paid on our ordinary and preference shares in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $39.5 million   and   $28.4 million  , respectively (  2015       $38.1 million   and   $28.4 million  ).

Underwriting Results by Business Segments       Nine Months    
  Please refer to the tables in Note 5 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of gross and net written and earned premiums, underwriting results and combined ratios and reserves for our two business segments for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The contributions of each business segment to gross written premiums in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Reinsurance 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   14.5%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business: 

Gross written premiums in our property catastrophe business lines   increase  d marginally compared to the prior year due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs which offset reductions in business written due to challenging market conditions.  The   decrease   in other property reinsurance was largely due to challenging market conditions and adjustments in prior year premium estimates on proportional contracts.  The   increase   in our casualty reinsurance lines of business was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. The   increase   in our specialty reinsurance business was due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic and favorable premium adjustments from prior years. 
  Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   55.2%   compared to   48.8%   in the equivalent period in   2015   due largely to a $50.3 million increase in catastrophe losses, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios and a   $1.3 million   reduction in reserve releases. In   the first nine months   of   2016  , we experienced $77.2 million of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $35.9 million   associated with the wildfires in Canada  ,   $26.0 million   from   weather-related events in the U.S.  ,   $7.5 million   from an earthquake in Japan,   $3.4 million   from a hailstorm in the Netherlands and   $2.2 million   from an earthquake in Taiwan. In the comparable period in   2015   we experienced a loss of   $27.0 million of losses associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China   and   $26.9 million   of natural catastrophe losses, including $7.0 million from the wildfires in the U.S. State of Washington and $18.9 million of other losses associated with the earthquake in Chile and weather-related events in the U.S., Europe, New Zealand and Australia. Reserve releases decreased from   $53.4 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $52.1 million   in the current period. Further information relating to the movement of prior year reserves is found below under  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.  
  Policy acquisition, general and administrative expenses.   Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was   $163.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   equivalent to   18.2%   of net premiums earned compared to   $168.6 million  , or   21.0%   of net premiums earned, in the equivalent period in   2015  .  The decrease in the acquisition ratio is due to the receipt of FET refunds and changes in business mix toward agriculture and specialty marine business lines, which have lower average commission rates and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average rates. 
  
   57 

The general and administrative expense ratio of   14.6%   increased from   12.8%   for the same period in   2015   due predominantly to costs associated with our acquisition of AgriLogic.  
  Insurance 
  Gross written premiums.   Gross written premiums in our insurance segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   1.9%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line:  

The   decrease   in  gross written premiums in property and casualty insurance is largely attributable to reductions in our global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. environmental business lines offset by growth in our U.S. excess casualty and railroad insurance business lines. The   decrease   in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance is largely due to challenging market conditions in our marine and energy liability, U.S. inland marine, offshore energy, and energy and construction insurance business lines offset by growth in our ocean cargo and aviation insurance business lines. The   increase   in gross written premiums in financial and professional insurance is largely attributable to growth in our accident and health, credit and political risks, management liability and financial institutions business lines. 
  Losses and loss adjustment expenses.   The loss ratio for   the first nine months   of   2016   remained the same at   61.5%   for the comparable period in   2015   largely due to higher catastrophe losses and a reduction in reserve releases offset by fewer large losses. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , there were   $34.6 million   of catastrophe losses associated with U.S. weather-related events compared to   $17.6 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015  .  Large losses in   the first nine months   of   2016   included   $29.6 million   of   energy-related losses  ,   $11.8 million   of   fire-related losses   and a   $4.2 million     aviation loss  . In the comparative period of   2015  , there were large losses including $23.6 million from fire and   weather-related events in the U.S.  , $37.6 million of energy-related losses, $5.0 from a train derailment and $3.0 million of losses from the port explosion in Tianjin, China.  Prior year reserve releases decreased by   $18.1 million   from   $44.2 million   in   the first nine months   of   2015   to   $26.1 million   in the current period. The reserve releases in the   nine  -month period were principally from our marine, aviation and energy lines most notably our energy physical damage offsetting adverse development in our property and casualty lines of business. The release in the comparative period in   2015   came primarily from our property and casualty lines, most notably excess casualty, U.K. commercial and U.S. property business lines offsetting adverse development in our marine, aviation and energy lines of business. Further information relating to the movement of prior year reserves is found below under  Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.  
  Policy acquisition, general and administrative expenses.   Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   19.9%   of net premiums earned compared to   18.9%   in the comparable period in 2015 due largely to lower over-rider commissions. Our general and administrative expenses in   the first nine months   of   2016   increased by   $21.9 million   to   $173.7 million   from   $151.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015   predominantly due to costs associated with growth in our insurance business.

Cash and Investments 
  As at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total cash and investments were   $9.3 billion   and   $8.8 billion  , respectively. The composition of our investment portfolio is summarized below: 

Fixed Income Securities.   As at   September 30, 2016  , the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was    AA-  ,  with   88.9%   of the portfolio rated  A  or higher. As at   December 31, 2015  , the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was    AA-  ,  with   88.8%   of the portfolio rated  A  or higher. Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, S P and Moody s, the lowest rating was used.  Our fixed income portfolio duration as at   September 30, 2016   was   3.64   years compared to   3.65   years as at   December 31, 2015   (  December 31, 2015       3.57   years including the impact of the interest rate swaps).   
  
   59 

Mortgage-Backed Securities.   The following table summarizes the fair value of our mortgage-backed securities by rating and class as at   September 30, 2016  . Our mortgage-backed portfolio is supported by loans diversified across a number of geographic and economic sectors. 

Equity Securities  .  Equity securities are comprised of U.S. and foreign equity securities and in prior periods were classified as available for sale or trading. As a result of rebalancing equity investments across subsidiary company balance sheets, a portion of equities were sold that were classified as available for sale, with a commensurate purchase of equities designated as trading securities. As a result, there was a realized investment gain of $28.9 million on this sale in 2015.  The total investment return from the available for sale and trading equity portfolios for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:         

Interest rate swaps.   On May 9, 2016, we terminated the remainder of our interest rate swap program. As at   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate swaps program had a notional value of $Nil compared with   $756.3 million   at December 31, 2015. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a charge in respect of the interest rate swaps of   $3.3 million   which consisted of a $9.9 million mark to market gain less $13.0 million of net interest payments.  For more information on our terminated interest rate swaps, refer to Note 10  Derivative Contracts   Interest Rate Swaps  of the consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements contained in this report. 
  European Fixed Income and Equity Exposures.   As at   September 30, 2016  , we had   $984.7 million  , or   10.6%   of our total cash and investments, invested in securities issued by European issuers, including the U.K. Our European exposures consisted of sovereigns, agencies, government guaranteed bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds and equities. We have no exposure to the sovereign debt of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal or Spain ( GIIPS ). 
  We manage our European fixed income exposures by proactively adapting our investment guidelines to our views on the European debt crisis.  We continue to prohibit purchases of GIIPS, Belgian sovereign and guaranteed debt, peripheral European bank debt and corporate bonds issued by companies domiciled in GIIPS countries.  
  We may purchase bonds issued by U.K and non-peripheral European select corporate financial issuers.

The tables below summarize our European holdings by country (Eurozone and non-Eurozone), rating and sector as at   September 30, 2016  . Equity investments included in the table below are not rated ( NR ). Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, S P and Moody s, the lowest rating was used.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , we had total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of   $4,826.8 million   (  December 31, 2015       $4,583.4 million  ). This amount represented our selected reserves for the ultimate liability for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses. The following tables analyze gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by business segment as at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

62 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a reduction of our estimate of the ultimate net claims to be paid in respect of prior accident years of   $78.2 million  . An analysis of this reduction by business segment is as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The key elements which gave rise to the net positive development during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 
  Reinsurance.   Net reserve releases were   $20.1 million   in the current quarter. Reserve releases in the quarter were as a result of favorable development across all of our reinsurance lines, the largest of which were from our other property and casualty reinsurance business lines due to better than expected development. 
  Insurance.   Net reserve releases were   $15.3 million   in the current quarter. The largest releases in the quarter were from marine, aviation and energy and financial and professional lines due to better than expected development offset by adverse development in our property and casualty lines of business. 
  The key elements which gave rise to the net positive development during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 
  Reinsurance.   Net reserve releases were   $52.1 million   in the period. The largest releases in the period were from our other property, casualty and specialty reinsurance lines due to better than expected development. 
  Insurance.   Net reserve releases were   $26.1 million   in the period. The largest releases in the period were from marine, aviation and energy and financial and professional lines due to better than expected development offset by adverse development in our property and casualty lines of business.

  Capital Management 
  The following table shows our capital structure as at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)    We do not consider the loan notes issued by VIEs to be part of our permanent capital as the noteholders have no recourse to the other assets of the Company. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , total shareholders  equity was   $3,904.1 million   compared to   $3,557.1 million   as at   December 31, 2015  . Our total shareholders  equity as at   September 30, 2016   includes three classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of   $797.1 million   net of share issuance costs (  December 31, 2015       $555.8 million  ). 
  On September 20, 2016, we issued   10,000,000   shares of 5.625% Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares with a liquidation preference of   $25   per share (the "5.625% Preference Shares").  Net proceeds were   $241.3 million  , comprising   $250.0 million   of total liquidation preference less   $8.7 million   of issue expenses.  The 5.625% Preference Shares have no stated maturity but are callable at our option on or after the 10 year anniversary of the date of issuance.  
  
   63 

On April 21, 2016, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.21 per ordinary share to $0.22 per ordinary share. On April 22, 2015, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.20 per ordinary share to $0.21 per ordinary share.  
  We acquired and cancelled   144,289   and   1,122,328   ordinary shares, respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The total consideration paid was   $6.5 million   and   $50.0 million  , respectively, with an average price per ordinary share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $45.17   and   $44.55  , respectively.  As at   September 30, 2016  , we had   $366.3 million   remaining under our current share repurchase authorization of $500.0 million granted on February 5, 2015. 
  Our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. Preference shares are often referred to as  hybrids  because they have certain attributes of both debt and equity. We monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders  equity plus outstanding debt.  As at   September 30, 2016  , this ratio was      32.0%   (  December 31, 2015       31.1%  ). 
  Our senior notes are the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings currently outstanding. As at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the value of the debt less amortization expenses was   $549.3 million   and   $549.2 million  , respectively. Management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital which was   14.5%   as at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015       17.8%  ).  
  In addition to the senior notes issued by Aspen Holdings, Silverton has also issued Loan Notes.  The fair value of the Loan Notes as at   September 30, 2016   was   $115.0 million   (  December 31, 2015       $190.6 million  ). For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of the  Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and Note 7 of the consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements contained in this report. 
  Access to Capital.   Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and the market s perception thereof, as measured by total shareholders  equity, which was   $3,904.1 million   as at   September 30, 2016   (  December 31, 2015        $3,419.9 million  ). We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, our operating results, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We regularly monitor our capital and financial position, as well as investment and securities market conditions, both in general and with respect to Aspen Holdings  securities. Our ordinary shares and preference shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
   
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. Management monitors the liquidity of Aspen Holdings and of each of its Operating Subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short-term liquidity resources on a stand-by basis. 
  Holding Company.   We monitor the ability of Aspen Holdings to service debt, finance dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders and provide financial support to the Operating Subsidiaries. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , Aspen Holdings held   $337.5 million   of cash, cash equivalents and investments (  December 31, 2015       $136.2 million  ) with the increase largely due to the issuance of the   5.625%   Perpetual Shares, comprising   $250.0 million   of total liquidation preference less $8.7 million of issuance expenses. This was offset by the   $52.7 million   acquisition cost for AgriLogic and the   $50.0 million   cost for the repurchase of ordinary shares in   the first nine months   of 2016.  Management considers the current cash, cash equivalents and investments taken together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities to be sufficient to appropriately satisfy the liquidity requirements of Aspen Holdings. Aspen Holdings  liquidity depends on dividends, capital distributions and interest payments from our Operating Subsidiaries. Aspen Holdings also has recourse to the credit facility described under  Letter of Credit Facilities  below. 
  The ability of our Operating Subsidiaries to pay us dividends or other distributions is subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the Operating Subsidiaries  need to maintain adequate capital requirements to maintain their insurance and reinsurance operations and their financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. On October 21, 2013, and in line with usual market practice for regulated institutions, the Prudential Regulation Authority (the  PRA ), the regulatory agency which oversees the prudential regulation of insurance companies in the U.K. such as Aspen U.K., requested that it be afforded the opportunity to provide a prior  non-objection  to all future dividend payments made by Aspen U.K. For a further discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our Operating Subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1  Business   Regulatory Matters  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. For a more detailed discussion of our Operating Subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends, see Note 16 of the  Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  
   64 

Operating Subsidiaries.   As at   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Subsidiaries held   $898.7 million   (  December 31, 2015       $1,136.4 million  ) in cash and short-term investments that are readily realizable securities. Management monitors the value, currency and duration of cash and investments held by the Operating Subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at   September 30, 2016   and for the foreseeable future. 
  On an ongoing basis, our Operating Subsidiaries  sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, losses and loss adjustment expenses, brokerage commissions, general and administrative expenses, taxes, interest and dividends and to purchase new investments. The potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time. 
  We manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short-term investments to meet these estimates. Notwithstanding this policy, if our cash flow forecast is incorrect, we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity, potentially at a significant loss. 
  The liquidity of our Operating Subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of our contractual obligations to policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders. For more information on these arrangements, including a table showing the forms of collateral or other security provided in respect of these obligations and undertakings, see Note 19(a) of the  Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Consolidated Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  .   Total net cash flow from operations for   the nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $379.8 million  , an increase of   $16.1 million   from the comparative period in   2015  . The increase is mainly attributable to growth in our business. For   the nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flow from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. 
  Letter of Credit Facilities.   For information relating to our credit facilities, refer to Note 16 of the consolidated condensed unaudited financial statements contained in this report.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations under long-term debt, operating leases (net of subleases) and reserves relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts as at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    The long-term debt obligations disclosed above do not include the   $29.0 million   annual interest payments on our outstanding senior notes or $37.8 million dividends payable to holders of our preference shares or the Loan Notes issued by Silverton in the amount of   $115.0 million  . 
               (2)   
    In estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall, as set out above, we utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns. By the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control. The total amount of payments in respect of our reserves, as well as the timing of such payments, may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies   Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses  filed with the SEC and due to the factors set out in this report under  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  below. 
     Further information on operating leases is given in Item 2,  Properties  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  For a discussion of our derivative instruments, refer to Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included in this report. 
  Effects of Inflation 
  Inflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims. The potential exists, after a catastrophe or other large property loss, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges. The cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation. We seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material. 
  Our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. We write casualty business in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and certain other territories, where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled. 
  In addition to general price inflation we are exposed to a persisting long-term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages. We seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business. 
  We also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short-term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed income securities. As at   September 30, 2016  , we consider that although inflation is currently low, in the medium-term there is a risk that inflation, interest rates and bond yields may rise, resulting in a decrease in the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report contains, and we may from time to time make other verbal or written, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our capital needs, business strategy, expectations and intentions. Statements that use the terms  believe,   do not believe,   anticipate,   expect,   assume,   objective,   target,   could,   would,   should,   plan,   estimate,   project,   outlook,   trends,   future,   seek,   will,   may,   aim,   likely,   continue,   intend,   guidance,   on track,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and because our business is subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and other cautionary statements made in this report, as well as the factors set forth below, should be read and understood as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. 
  All forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions, estimates and data concerning future results and events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.  
  All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth under  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States SEC and the following: 
             
    our ability to successfully implement steps to further optimize the business portfolio, ensure capital efficiency and enhance investment returns;

    our dependence on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues; 
                
    the persistence of heightened financial risks, including excess sovereign debt, the banking system and the Eurozone crisis; 
                
    changes in government regulations or tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business;

    increased counterparty risk due to the credit impairment of financial institutions; and 
                
    Aspen Holdings or Aspen Bermuda becoming subject to income taxes in the United States or the United Kingdom. 
     In addition, any estimates relating to loss events involve the exercise of considerable judgment and reflect a combination of ground-up evaluations, information available to date from brokers and cedants, market intelligence, initial tentative loss reports and other sources. Due to the complexity of factors contributing to losses and the preliminary nature of the information used to prepare estimates, there can be no assurance that our ultimate losses will remain within stated amounts. 
  The rate changes described in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Outlook and Trends  reflect management s assessment of changes in exposure-adjusted rates on renewals only. This does not include contracts with fundamental changes to terms and conditions. The calculation involves a degree of judgment in relation to comparability of contracts in the different business lines. Due to changes in assumptions underlying the pricing of contracts, the trends in premium rates reflected in our outlook and trends may not be comparable over time. The future profitability of each business line is dependent upon many factors besides the trends in premium rates. 
  The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise or disclose any difference between our actual results and those reflected in such statements. 
  
   68 

If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. All forward-looking statements in this report reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the points made above. You should specifically consider the factors identified in this report which could cause actual results to differ before making an investment decision.

Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures  
  Net income available to ordinary shareholders', a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is calculated as net income for the period less the amount attributable to non-controlling interest and dividends on preference shares during the period.  

Average ordinary shareholders' equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is calculated as the arithmetic average on a monthly basis for the stated periods of shareholders' equity excluding the aggregate value of the liquidation preferences of our preference shares, net of issuance costs, and the total amount of non-controlling interest. 

Annualized net income return on average equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders' by average ordinary shareholders' equity and annualizing the product.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest rate risk.   Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities. Accordingly, our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities. As interest rates rise, the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls, and the converse is also true. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk includes maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on market value. On May 9, 2016, we terminated our interest rate swap program which aimed to partially mitigate our exposure to interest rate. For more information on the terminated interest rate swaps, refer to Item 2  Cash and Investments   Interest rate swaps  above. 
  As at   September 30, 2016  , our fixed income portfolio had an approximate duration of   3.64   years. The table below depicts interest rates change scenarios and the effects on our interest rate sensitive invested assets:    

  Equity risk.   We have invested in equity securities which had a fair market value of   $797.7 million   as at   September 30, 2016  , equivalent to   8.6%   of the total of investments, cash and cash equivalents at that date (  December 31, 2015       $736.4 million  ,   8.4%  ). These equity investments are exposed to equity price risk, defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices. We believe that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of our investments in equities relative to total invested assets mitigate our exposure to equity price risk. 
  Foreign currency risk.   Our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. The functional currencies of our operations include U.S. Dollars, British Pounds, Euros, Canadian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Australian Dollars and Singaporean Dollars. As at   September 30, 2016  ,   88.7%   (  December 31, 2015       88.7%  ) of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held in U.S. Dollars,   5.0%   (  December 31, 2015       5.1%  ) were in British Pounds and   6.3%   (  December 31, 2015       6.2%  ) were in other currencies. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   18.7%   (  December 31, 2015       15.3%  ) of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound in the remainder of   2016  . 
  Other foreign currency amounts are re-measured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations. Functional currency amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into U.S. Dollars. The unrealized gain or loss from this translation, net of tax, is recorded as part of shareholders  equity. The change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the period, net of tax, is a component of comprehensive income. Both the re-measurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations. We may experience exchange losses to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not hedged, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management estimates that a   10%   change in the exchange rate between British Pounds and U.S. Dollars as at   September 30, 2016   would have impacted our net reportable British Pound net assets by approximately   $12.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (  September 30, 2015     approximately   $4.0 million  ). 
  We manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies. This may involve the use of foreign exchange contracts from time to time. A foreign exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract. Foreign exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time.  For a discussion of our derivative instruments including foreign exchange contracts, refer to Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included in this report. 
  Credit risk.   We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities. Our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest predominantly in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories, business sectors and any one issuer. As at   September 30, 2016  , the average rating of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was    AA-    (  December 31, 2015        AA-   ).  
  
   71 

In addition, we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for our policyholders, as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us. Other than fully collateralized reinsurance, the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of  A  (Excellent), the third highest of fifteen rating levels, or better by A.M. Best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is  A-  (Excellent), the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels, by A.M. Best. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period of this report. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the disclosure requirements are met. Based on the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted to the Commission under the Exchange Act by the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely fashion, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  The Company s management has performed an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the Company s management is not aware of any change in its internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION    
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
  Similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry, we are subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of our business. Our Operating Subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the investigation, conduct and defense of disputes, or potential disputes, resulting from questions of insurance or reinsurance coverage or claims activities. Pursuant to our insurance and reinsurance arrangements, many of these disputes are resolved by arbitration or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. In some jurisdictions, noticeably the U.S., a failure to deal with such disputes or potential disputes in an appropriate manner could result in an award of  bad faith  punitive damages against our operating subsidiaries. In addition, we may be subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from, or directly relate to, insurance and reinsurance coverage or claims. This category of litigation typically involves, among other things, allegations of underwriting errors or omissions, employment claims or regulatory activity. 
  While any legal or arbitration proceedings contain an element of uncertainty, we do not believe that the eventual outcome of any specific litigation, arbitration or alternative dispute resolution proceedings to which we are currently a party will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our business as a whole. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no significant changes to the Company s risk factors as discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, each filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

  Item 5.    Other Information 
  Disclosure of Certain Activities Relating to Iran 
  
   73 

Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Section 13(r) ), requires all issuers that file annual or quarterly reports with the SEC to disclose certain activities, transactions or dealings with Iran.  Many of the activities, transactions and dealings that Section 13(r) requires to be reported were previously subject to U.S. sanctions or prohibited by applicable local law.  On January 16, 2016, the United States and the E.U. eased sanctions against Iran pursuant to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and many of the reportable activities, transactions and dealings under Section 13(r) are no longer subject to U.S. sanctions and no longer prohibited by applicable local law. 
  Certain of our operations located outside the United States underwrite marine and energy treaties on a worldwide basis and, as a result, the underlying insurance and reinsurance portfolios may have exposure to the Iranian petroleum resources, refined petroleum, and petrochemical industries.  For example, certain of our operations underwrite global marine hull and cargo policies that provide coverage for vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide, including Iran.  We do not believe that any coverage we have provided has directly or significantly facilitated or contributed to the Iranian petroleum resources, refined petroleum, or petrochemical industry. 
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we are not aware of any premium apportionment with respect to underwriting insurance or reinsurance activities reportable under Section 13(r).  Should any such risks have entered into the stream of commerce covered by the insurance and reinsurance portfolios underlying our treaties, we believe that the premiums associated with such business would be immaterial.

  CERTIFICATIONS 
  I, Christopher O Kane, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited;

              a)

              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
