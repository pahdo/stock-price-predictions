  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  FOR THE PERIODS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 25, 2016   AND   SEPTEMBER 27, 2015    
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the financial records of Cedar Fair, L.P. (the Partnership) without audit and reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the results of the interim periods covered in this report.  Due to the seasonal nature of the Partnership's amusement and water park operations, the results for any interim period may not be indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. 

(1) Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies: 
  The Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   included in this Form 10-Q report have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which were included in the Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K referred to above. 
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain prior year operating activity amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation.   
  Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-03").  The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying value of the corresponding debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  This ASU requires retrospective adoption and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this guidance and applied retrospective treatment.  The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have an impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations or unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  The impact of the adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the unamortized debt issuance cost amounts from other assets to long-term debt on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for the prior periods of   $19.7 million   and   $20.9 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ("ASU 2015-17").  The amendments in ASU 2015-17 require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the balance sheet.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.  The guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets, or retrospectively to all periods presented.  We adopted this guidance early and applied retrospective treatment.  The impact of the adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the current deferred tax assets to net against the deferred tax liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, which reduced both the current deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability for the prior periods by   $12.2 million   and   $9.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09").  The amendments in ASU 2014-09 provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  It permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method, and early adoption is not permitted.  The Partnership has not yet selected a transition method and is in the process of evaluating the effect this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").  The amendments in ASU 2016-02 provide that most leases will now be recorded on the balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and will replace most existing lease guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  This ASU requires a modified transition method for existing leases and applies to the earliest period presented in the  
  
    7 

     Table of Contents  

financial statements.  The Partnership is in the process of evaluating the effect this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09").  The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are meant to simplify the current accounting for share-based payment transactions, specifically the accounting for income taxes, award classification, cash flow presentation, and accounting for forfeitures.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  The Partnership is in the process of evaluating the effect this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

(2) Interim Reporting: 
  The Partnership owns and operates   eleven   amusement parks,   two   separately gated outdoor water parks,   one   indoor water park and   five   hotels.  Virtually all of the Partnership s revenues from its seasonal amusement parks, as well as its outdoor water parks and other seasonal resort facilities, are realized during a   130  - to   140  -day operating period beginning in early May, with the major portion concentrated in the third quarter during the peak vacation months of July and August.  Knott's Berry Farm is open daily on a year-round basis.  Castaway Bay is generally open daily from Memorial Day to Labor Day with an additional limited daily schedule for the balance of the year. 
  To assure that these highly seasonal operations will not result in misleading comparisons of current and subsequent interim periods, the Partnership has adopted the following accounting and reporting procedures for its seasonal parks: (a) revenues on multi-use products are recognized over the estimated number of uses expected for each type of product and are adjusted periodically during the operating season prior to the ticket or product expiration, which occurs no later than the close of the operating season or December 31 each year, (b) depreciation, advertising and certain seasonal operating costs are expensed during each park s operating season, including certain costs incurred prior to the season which are amortized over the season, and (c) all other costs are expensed as incurred or ratably over the entire year.  Revenues on multi-use products for the next operating season are deferred in the year received and recognized as revenue in the following operating season.

(3) Long-Lived Assets: 
  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred.  Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in equity price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates.  Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The long-lived operating asset impairment test involves a two-step process.  The first step is a comparison of each asset group's carrying value to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including disposition.  Projected future cash flows reflect management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenues and costs, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures.  Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates and future estimates of capital expenditures.  If the carrying value of the asset group is higher than its undiscounted future cash flows, there is an indication that impairment exists and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss.  The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the asset group to its carrying value in a manner consistent with the highest and best use of those assets.  
    
  The Partnership estimates fair value of operating assets using an income, market, and/or cost approach.  The income approach uses an asset group's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital reflective of current market conditions.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.  The cost approach is based on the amount currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset adjusted for obsolescence.  If the implied fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. 
    
  Non-operating assets are evaluated for impairment based on changes in market conditions.  When changes in market conditions are observed, impairment is estimated using a market-based approach.  If the estimated fair value of the non-operating assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership ceased operations of one of its separately gated outdoor water parks, Wildwater Kingdom, located near Cleveland in Aurora, Ohio.  In 2014, the carrying value of the long-lived operating assets related to Wildwater Kingdom was deemed to be impaired and the associated loss was recognized.  At the date that Wildwater Kingdom ceased operations, the only remaining long-lived asset was the approximate   670   acres of land owned by the Partnership.  This land has an associated carrying value of   $17.1 million  .  As of September 25, 2016, the Partnership assessed the remaining asset and concluded there was no impairment.  The associated acreage is classified as assets held-for-sale within "Other Assets" in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

(4) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: 
  In accordance with the applicable accounting rules, goodwill is not amortized, but, along with indefinite-lived trade names, is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.  As of   September 25, 2016  , there were no indicators of impairment.  The Partnership's annual testing date is the first day of the fourth quarter.   
  There were no impairments for any period presented.  
  A summary of changes in the Partnership s carrying value of goodwill for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   is as follows: 

At   September 25, 2016  , December 31, 2015, and   September 27, 2015  , the Partnership s other intangible assets consisted of the following: 

Amortization expense of other intangible assets is expected to continue to be immaterial going forward.

(5) Long-Term Debt: 
  Long-term debt as of   September 25, 2016  , December 31, 2015, and   September 27, 2015   consisted of the following:  

(1)    The average interest rate does not reflect the effect of interest rate swap agreements (see Note 6). 
  In June 2014, the Partnership issued   $450 million   of   5.375%   senior unsecured notes ("June 2014 notes"), maturing in   2024  .  The net proceeds from the offering of the June 2014 notes were used to redeem in full all of the Partnership s   $405 million   of   9.125%   July 2010 senior unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in   2018   (and which included   $5.6 million   of Original Issue Discount ("OID") to yield   9.375%  ), to satisfy and discharge the indenture governing the notes that were redeemed and for general corporate purposes. 
  The Partnership's June 2014 notes pay interest semi-annually in June and December, with the principal due in full on June 1, 2024.  Prior to June 1, 2017, up to   35%   of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to   105.375%   together with accrued and unpaid interest.  The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2019 at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a  make-whole  premium together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.  Thereafter, the notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed.  
  In March 2013, the Partnership issued   $500 million   of   5.25%   senior unsecured notes ("March 2013 notes"), maturing in 2021.  The Partnership's March 2013 notes pay interest semi-annually in March and September, with the principal due in full on   March 15, 2021  .  The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to March 15, 2017 at a price equal to   103.938%   of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.  The notes may be redeemed after this date, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed.   
    
  Concurrently with this offering, the Partnership entered into a new   $885 million   credit agreement (the "2013 Credit Agreement"), which included a   $630 million   senior secured term loan facility and a   $255 million   senior secured revolving credit facility.  The terms of the senior secured term loan facility include a maturity date of March 6, 2020 and an interest rate of LIBOR ("London InterBank Offering Rate") plus   250   bps with a LIBOR floor of   75   bps.  The term loan amortizes at   $6.3 million   annually and allows interest to be paid on a 30-, 60-, or 90-day basis.  The net proceeds from the notes and borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the previous credit facilities.  The facilities provided under the 2013 Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Partnership. 
    
  Terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement include a revolving credit facility of a combined   $255 million  .  Under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Canadian portion of the revolving credit facility has a sub-limit of   $15 million  .  U.S. denominated and Canadian denominated loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   225   bps (with no LIBOR floor).  The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in   March 2018   and also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit.  The 2013 Credit Agreement requires the Partnership to pay a commitment fee of   38   bps per annum on the unused portion of the credit facilities. 
    
  The 2013 Credit Agreement includes   two   Financial Condition Covenants, which if breached for any reason and not cured, could result in an event of default.  At the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, the first of these, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, was set at a maximum of   5.50  x consolidated total debt (excluding the revolving debt)-to-consolidated EBITDA.  This required ratio  
  
    11 

     Table of Contents  

decreased by   0.25  x at the beginning of the second quarter of 2016.  The final decrease will occur at the beginning of the second quarter of 2017 when the ratio will reach its minimum of   5.25  x.  The second of these required ratios, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, is set at a minimum of   1.1  x (consolidated total fixed charges-to-consolidated EBITDA).  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Partnership was in compliance with these Financial Condition Covenants and all other covenants under the 2013 Credit Agreement. 
    
  The Partnership is allowed to make Restricted Payments, as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement, of up to   $60 million   annually, so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing and so long as the Partnership would be in compliance with certain financial ratios after giving effect to the payments.  Additional Restricted Payments are allowed to be made based on an Excess-Cash-Flow formula should the Partnership s pro-forma Consolidated Leverage Ratio be less than or equal to   5.0  x.  Pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Partnership's June 2014 and March 2013 notes, the Partnership can make Restricted Payments of   $60 million   annually so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing; and our ability to make additional Restricted Payments in 2016 and beyond is permitted should the Partnership's pro forma Total-Indebtedness-to-Consolidated-Cash-Flow Ratio be less than or equal to   5.0  x. 
    
  As market conditions warrant, the Partnership may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by the Partnership, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise. 

(6) Derivative Financial Instruments: 
  Derivative financial instruments are used within the Partnership s overall risk management program to manage interest rate risk.  By utilizing a derivative instrument to hedge our exposure to LIBOR rate changes, the Partnership is exposed to counterparty credit risk, in particular the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.  To mitigate this risk, hedging instruments are placed with a counterparty that the Partnership believes poses minimal credit risk.  The Partnership does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership amended each of its   four   interest rate swap agreements to extend each of the maturities by   two   years to December 31, 2020 and to fix LIBOR at a rate of   2.64%  .  As a result of the amendments, the previously existing interest rate swap agreements were de-designated, and the amounts recorded in AOCI are being amortized into earnings through the original December 2018 maturity.  The newly amended interest rate swap agreements are not designated as hedging instruments.  There were no other changes to the terms of the agreements beyond those disclosed.  
  The fair value of derivative financial instruments and their classification within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 25, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 27, 2015 are as follows:   

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  Changes in fair value of highly effective hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI in the balance sheet.  Any ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in income.  Amounts recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transactions affect earnings.  As a result of the first quarter of 2016 amendments, the previously existing interest rate swap agreements were de-designated and the newly amended interest rate swap agreements are not designated as hedging instruments.  As of   September 25, 2016  , we have no designated derivatives; therefore,   no   amount of designated derivatives are forecasted to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months. 
  
    12 

     Table of Contents  

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or were de-designated are prospectively adjusted to fair value each reporting period through "Net effect of swaps" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  The amounts that were previously recorded as a component of AOCI prior to the de-designation are reclassified to earnings, and a corresponding realized gain or loss will be recognized when the forecasted cash flow occurs.  As a result of the first quarter 2016 amendments, the previously existing interest rate swap agreements were de-designated, and the amounts previously recorded in AOCI are being amortized into earnings through the original December 2018 maturity.  As of   September 25, 2016  , approximately   $21.3 million   of losses remain in AOCI related to the effective cash flow hedge contracts prior to de-designation,   $9.5 million   of which will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.  
  The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on income and other comprehensive income for the three-month periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  : 

During the quarter ended   September 25, 2016  , the Partnership recognized   $0.7 million   of gains on the derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges and   $2.4 million   of expense representing the regular amortization of amounts in AOCI.  The effect of these amounts resulted in a charge to earnings of   $1.7 million   recorded in  Net effect of swaps.  
    
  During the quarter ended   September 27, 2015  , the Partnership recognized   $3.1 million   of gains on the derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges and   $1.7 million   of expense representing the amortization of amounts in AOCI.  The effect of these amounts resulted in a benefit to earnings of   $1.4 million   recorded in  Net effect of swaps.  
    
  The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on income and other comprehensive income for the nine-month periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  : 

During the nine-month period ended   September 25, 2016  , the Partnership recognized   $2.6 million   of losses on the derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges and   $6.3 million   of expense representing the regular amortization of amounts in AOCI.  The effect of these amounts resulted in a charge to earnings of   $8.9 million   recorded in  Net effect of swaps.  
    
  During the nine-month period ended   September 27, 2015  , the Partnership recognized   $8.0 million   of gains on the derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges and   $5.1 million   of expense representing the amortization of amounts in AOCI.  The effect of these amounts resulted in a benefit to earnings of   $3.0 million   recorded in  Net effect of swaps.  

(7) Fair Value Measurements: 
  The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) relating to fair value measurements emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions (inputs) that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  Inputs may be observable or unobservable, and valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Accordingly, the FASB s ASC establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that ranks the quality and reliability of information used to determine fair values.  The hierarchy is associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value and defines three levels of inputs to the fair  
  
    13 

     Table of Contents  

value measurement process.  Quoted prices are the most reliable valuation inputs, whereas model values that include inputs based on unobservable data are the least reliable.  Each fair value measurement must be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
  The three broad levels of inputs defined by the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
     A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of   September 25, 2016  , December 31, 2015, and   September 27, 2015   on a recurring basis as well as the fair values of other financial instruments: 

Fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are determined using significant inputs, including the LIBOR forward curves, which are considered Level 2 observable market inputs.  In addition, the Partnership considered the effect of its credit and non-performance risk on the fair values provided, and recognized an adjustment decreasing the net derivative liability by approximately   $0.9 million   as of   September 25, 2016  ,   $0.6 million   as of December 31, 2015, and   $0.8 million   as of   September 27, 2015  . 
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, revolving credit loans, accounts receivable, current portion of term debt, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  There were no assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 25, 2016  , December 31, 2015, or   September 27, 2015  .

(8) Earnings per Unit: 
  Net income per limited partner unit is calculated based on the following unit amounts: 

The effect of out-of-money and/or antidilutive unit options on the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively, had they not been out of the money or antidilutive, would have been immaterial in all periods presented. 

(9) Income and Partnership Taxes: 
  Under the applicable accounting rules, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable by the Partnership s corporate subsidiaries for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes.  The income tax provision (benefit) for interim periods is determined by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to the quarterly income (loss) of the Partnership s corporate subsidiaries.  In addition to income taxes on its corporate subsidiaries, the Partnership is subject to a publicly traded partnership tax (PTP tax) on partnership-level gross income (net revenues less cost of food, merchandise and games).  As such, the Partnership s total provision (benefit) for taxes includes amounts for both the PTP tax and for income taxes on its corporate subsidiaries. 
  As of the   third   quarter of 2016, the Partnership has recorded   $0.9 million   of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and/or penalties related to state and local tax filing positions.  The Partnership recognizes interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.  The Partnership does not anticipate that the balance of the unrecognized tax benefit will change significantly over the next 12 months. 
   
  (10) Contingencies: 
  The Partnership is a party to a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.  In the opinion of management, none of these matters are expected to have a material effect in the aggregate on the Partnership's financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Business Overview: 
  We generate our revenues primarily from sales of (1) admission to our parks, (2) food, merchandise and games inside our parks, and (3) hotel rooms, food and other attractions both inside and outside our parks.  Our principal costs and expenses, which include salaries and wages, advertising, maintenance, operating supplies, utilities and insurance are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance. 
    
  Each of our properties is overseen by a park general manager and operates autonomously.  Management reviews operating results, evaluates performance and makes operating decisions, including allocating resources, on a property-by-property basis. 
    
  Along with attendance and guest per capita statistics, discrete financial information and operating results are prepared at the individual park level for use by the CEO, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), as well as by the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Executive Vice President - Operations, and the park general managers. 

Critical Accounting Policies: 
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These principles require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
  Management believes that judgment and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect our consolidated financial statements: 
     
     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
     Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
     Self-Insurance Reserves 
    
     Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
     Revenue Recognition 

Income Taxes 
     In the   third   quarter of   2016  , there were no changes in the above critical accounting policies from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
    28 

Table of Contents  

Adjusted EBITDA: 
  We believe that Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-cash items, and adjustments as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement) is a meaningful measure of park-level operating profitability because we use it for measuring returns on capital investments, evaluating potential acquisitions, determining awards under incentive compensation plans, and calculating compliance with certain loan covenants.  Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the discussion of results of operations that follows as a supplemental measure of our operating results and is not intended to be a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as defined under generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
  The table below sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  .

Results of Operations: 
   
  Nine months ended September 25, 2016 
    
  The fiscal nine-month period ended   September 25, 2016   included a total of 1,825 operating days compared with 1,876 operating days for the fiscal nine-month period ended   September 27, 2015  .  The following table presents key financial information for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  : 

(1)     For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, including how we define and use Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation from net income, see page 29. 
   (2)      Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues) is not a measurement computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or a substitute for measures computed in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  The Partnership provides Adjusted EBITDA margin because it believes the measure provides a meaningful metric of operating profitability. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 25, 2016  , net revenues increased by   $27.9 million  , to   $1,096.8 million  , from   $1,068.9 million   for the first nine months of 2015.  This reflects an increase in both attendance and in-park per capita spending, as well as an increase in out-of park revenues compared to the same period in the prior year.  The   283,000   visit, or   1.3%  , increase in attendance was driven by higher season pass visitation as the result of new rides and attractions, including live entertainment and multi-week special events.  The   $0.52  , or   1.1%  , increase in in-park per capita spending was attributable to increases in admissions pricing and growth in our food and beverage programs during the first nine months of the year.  The   $6.7 million  , or   5.9%  , increase in out-of-park revenues reflects favorable performance at our resort properties, increased transaction fees from on-line advanced purchases, an increase in special events at several parks, and proceeds received from a business interruption insurance claim relating to an early season electrical outage at Cedar Point.  The overall increase in net revenues is net of an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.6 million related to our Canadian property for the first nine months of the year. 
    
  Operating costs and expenses for the nine months increased   4.4%  , or   $28.2 million  , to   $676.4 million   from   $648.2 million   for the first nine months of 2015.  The increase is the result of a $2.0 million increase in cost of goods sold, a $17.4 million increase in operating expenses, and an $8.8 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SG A").  The $2.0 million increase in cost of goods sold relates to the higher attendance levels, as well as meal and beverage plan program growth.  As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold was comparable for both periods.  The $17.4 million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher seasonal and maintenance labor costs.  These labor costs are increasing due to planned market-based adjustments and minimum-wage rate increases along with related employer taxes.  The $8.8 million increase in SG A expense was primarily due to increases in media and other marketing costs, technology and security related costs, and higher e-commerce and merchant fees.  The overall increase in operating costs and expenses is net of a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $1.6 million related to our Canadian property for the first nine months of the year. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the first nine months increased   $8.0 million   due to growth in capital improvements.  For the first nine months of 2016, the loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets was   $5.4 million  , reflecting the retirement of assets in the normal course of business at several of our properties, as compared to   $9.4 million   for the first nine months of  
  
    30 

     Table of Contents  

2015.  After depreciation, amortization, loss on impairment/retirement of fixed assets, and all other non-cash costs, operating income decreased   $4.3 million   to   $296.8 million   for the first nine months of 2016 compared to operating income of   $301.1 million   for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  Interest expense for the first nine months of 2016 decreased to $61.9 million from $64.2 million for the first nine months of 2015 relating to a decline in the outstanding notional amounts of our derivative contracts and the corresponding reductions in required settlement payments.  The net effect of our swaps resulted in a non-cash charge to earnings of $8.9 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared with a $3.0 million non-cash benefit to earnings in 2015 for the same period.  The difference reflects the change in fair market value movements in our de-designated swap portfolio offset by the amortization of amounts in OCI for these swaps.  During the period, we also recognized a $23.7 million net benefit to earnings for unrealized/realized foreign currency compared with a $64.2 million net charge to earnings for the same period in 2015.  Amounts in both periods primarily represented foreign currency movements on the U.S.-dollar denominated debt held at our Canadian property. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, a provision for taxes of $65.3 million was recorded to account for PTP taxes and income taxes on our corporate subsidiaries.  This compares to a $37.8 million provision for taxes recorded for the first nine months of 2015.  The increase in tax provision between periods relates largely to an increase in pretax income from our corporate subsidiaries, in particular from the change in unrealized foreign currency gains and losses.  The increase in provision for taxes is net of a $1.5 million tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2016 related to a release of valuation allowance based on management's updated projection of future foreign tax credit utilization.  Total cash taxes to be paid or payable in 2016 are estimated to range from $50 million to $55 million, compared to $20.0 million in cash taxes paid in 2015.  The expected increase in cash taxes relates to improving business performance and the fact that net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized in 2015. 
    
  After the items above, net income for the first nine months totaled $184.5 million, or $3.27 per diluted limited partner unit, compared with a net income of $137.9 million, or $2.46 per diluted unit, for the same period a year ago. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, our Adjusted EBITDA was   $427.8 million  , an amount comparable to the same period a year ago.  Our Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased by 120 basis points for the first nine months of 2016 to 39.0%, from 40.2% for the same period last year.  The margin decline is directly attributable to planned expenses outpacing modest revenue growth, period over period. 

Three months ended September 25, 2016 
    
  The fiscal three-month period ended   September 25, 2016   included a total of 1,021 operating days compared with 1,029 operating days for the fiscal three-month period ended   September 27, 2015  .  The following table presents key financial information for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  :

     Table of Contents  

For the quarter ended   September 25, 2016  , net revenues increased by   $5.6 million  , to   $650.3 million  , from   $644.6 million   in the third quarter of 2015.  This reflects an increase in in-park per capita spending and an increase in out-of park revenues.  The increases are offset by a slight decline in attendance of   54,000   visits, or   0.4%  , for the quarter which is attributable primarily to unseasonably high temperatures during July and August.  The   $0.52  , or   1.1%  , increase in in-park per capita spending was due to increases in admissions pricing and growth in our food and beverage programs.  The   $3.3 million  , or   5.1%  , increase in out-of-park revenues primarily reflects favorable performance at our resort properties and proceeds received from a business interruption insurance claim relating to an early season electrical outage at Cedar Point.  The overall increase in net revenues was not materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates during the period. 
    
  Operating costs and expenses for the quarter increased   4.7%  , or   $14.3 million  , to   $316.4 million   from   $302.1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  The increase is the result of a $10.7 million increase in operating expenses and a $3.7 million increase in SG A.  Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter.  As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold was comparable for both periods.  The $10.7 million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher seasonal and maintenance labor costs.  These labor costs are increasing due to planned market-based adjustments and minimum-wage rate increases along with related employer taxes.  The increase in labor costs was partially offset by decreases in maintenance costs.  The $3.7 million increase in SG A expense was attributable to increases in media and other marketing costs, technology and security related costs, and higher e-commerce and merchant fees.  The increase in operating costs and expenses was not materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates during the   third   quarter. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased   $5.6 million   due to growth in capital improvements.  For the   third   quarter of 2016, the loss on impairment / retirement of fixed assets was   $1.4 million  , reflecting the retirement of assets in the normal course of business at several of our properties, compared to   $5.8 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  After depreciation, amortization, loss on impairment/retirement of fixed assets, and all other non-cash costs, operating income decreased   $9.9 million   to   $267.8 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to operating income of   $277.7 million   for the   third   quarter of 2015. 
    
  Interest expense for the   third   quarter of 2016 decreased to $21.0 million from $22.2 million in the   third   quarter of 2015 relating to a decline in the outstanding notional amounts of our derivative contracts and the corresponding reductions in required settlement payments.  The net effect of our swaps resulted in a non-cash charge to earnings of $1.7 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with a $1.4 million non-cash benefit to earnings in the   third   quarter of 2015.  The difference reflects the change in fair market value movements in our de-designated swap portfolio offset by the amortization of amounts in OCI for these swaps.  During the current quarter, we also recognized a $7.3 million net charge to earnings for unrealized/realized foreign currency compared with a $33.9 million net charge to earnings for the   third   quarter in 2015.  Both amounts primarily represented foreign currency movements on the U.S.-dollar denominated debt held at our Canadian property. 
    
  During the   third   quarter, a provision for taxes of $62.9 million was recorded to account for PTP taxes and income taxes on our corporate subsidiaries.  This compares to a provision for taxes recorded in the   third   quarter of 2015 of $58.9 million.  This increase in tax provision relates largely to an increase in pretax income from our corporate subsidiaries compared to the same period a year ago.  The increase in provision for taxes is net of a $1.5 million tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2016 based on management's updated projection of future foreign tax credit utilization.   
    
  After the items above, net income for the quarter totaled $175.0 million, or $3.10 per diluted limited partner unit, compared with net income of $164.2 million, or $2.92 per diluted unit, for the   third   quarter a year ago. 
    
  For the current quarter, our Adjusted EBITDA decreased to   $336.0 million   from   $345.6 million   for the fiscal   third   quarter of 2015.  The approximate   $9.6 million   decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is due to the slight attendance decline caused by unseasonably high temperatures during July and August which negatively impacted revenue growth during the period, and planned increases in seasonal labor costs compared with the same period in the prior year.  

October 2016 
    
  Based on preliminary results, net revenues through October 30, 2016, were approximately $1.23 billion, up 4%, or $42 million, compared with $1.19 billion for the same period last year.  The rise in net revenues was the result of a 2%, or 558,000-visit, increase in attendance to a record 24.2 million visits, a 1%, or $0.52, increase in in-park per capita spending to a record $46.82 and a 6%, or $8 million, increase in out-of-park revenues to a record $135 million compared with 2015.

  With respect to both liquidity and cash flow, we ended the   third   quarter of   2016   in sound condition.  The working capital ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 1.1 at   September 25, 2016   is the result of normal seasonal activity.  Receivables, inventories and payables are at normal seasonal levels. 
  Operating Activities 
  During the   nine  -month period ended   September 25, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was $340.0 million, an amount comparable to the same period a year ago. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the first   nine   months of 2016 was $126.9 million, a decrease of $19.6 million compared with the same period ended   September 27, 2015   in the prior year.  This decrease reflects lower capital expenditures in the period and a $2.0 million preferred equity investment made in a non-public entity in the prior year. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the first   nine   months of 2016 was $146.9 million, an increase of $18.6 million compared with the same period ended   September 27, 2015   in the prior year.  This increase reflects both an increase in unitholder distributions and a term debt payment of $6.0 million which was made in the second quarter of 2016. 
  As of   September 25, 2016  , our outstanding debt, before reduction for debt issuance costs, consisted of the following: 
             
    $450 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes, maturing in 2024, issued at par.  Prior to June 1, 2017, up to 35% of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to 105.375% together with accrued and unpaid interest.  The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2019 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a "make-whole" premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.  The notes may be redeemed after this date, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed.  The notes pay interest semi-annually in June and December. 
                
    $500 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes, maturing in 2021, issued at par.  The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to March 15, 2017 at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.  The notes may be redeemed after this date, in whole or in part, at various prices depending on the date redeemed.  The notes pay interest semi-annually in March and September. 
                 
    No borrowings under the $255 million senior secured revolving credit facility under our 2013 Credit Agreement.  Under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Canadian portion of the revolving credit facility has a sub-limit of $15 million.  U.S. denominated and Canadian denominated loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 bps (with no LIBOR floor).  The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in March 2018 and also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit.  The 2013 Credit Agreement requires that we pay a commitment fee of 38 bps per annum on the unused portion of the credit facilities.  After letters of credit, which totaled $15.9 million at   September 25, 2016  , we had $239.1 million of available borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand of $187.3 million. 
     As of   September 25, 2016  , we have $500 million of interest rate swaps in place that effectively convert variable-rate debt to fixed rates.  These swaps, which mature in December 2020 and fix LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 2.64%, were not designated as cash flow hedges.  Additional detail regarding our current and historical swap arrangements is provided in Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and in Note 6 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016. 
  At   September 25, 2016  , the fair market value of our derivative portfolio was   $30.2 million   and was recorded in "Derivative Liability." 
    
  The 2013 Credit Agreement includes two Financial Condition Covenants, which if breached for any reason and not cured, could result in an event of default.  At the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, the first of these, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, was set at a maximum of 5.50x consolidated total debt (excluding the revolving debt)-to-consolidated EBITDA.  The required ratio decreased by 0.25x at the beginning of the second quarter of 2016.  The final decrease will occur at the beginning of the second  
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  

quarter of 2017 when the ratio will reach its minimum of 5.25x.  The second of these required ratios, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, is set at a minimum of 1.1x (consolidated total fixed charges-to-consolidated EBITDA).  As of   September 25, 2016  , we were in compliance with these Financial Condition Covenants and all other covenants under the 2013 Credit Agreement. 
    
  The 2013 Credit Agreement allows restricted payments of up to $60 million annually so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, and so long as the Partnership would be in compliance with certain financial ratios after giving effect to the payments.  Additional restricted payments are allowed to be made based on an excess-cash-flow formula should our pro-forma Consolidated Leverage Ratio be less than or equal to 5.0x. 
    
  The indentures governing our notes also include annual restricted payment limitations and additional permitted payment formulas.  We can make restricted payments of $60 million annually so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Our ability to make additional restricted payments is permitted should our pro forma Total Indebtedness-to-Consolidated-Cash-Flow Ratio be less than or equal to 5.0x. 
  In accordance with these debt provisions, on August 3, 2016, we announced the declaration of a distribution of $0.825 per limited partner unit, which was paid on September 15, 2016.  Also, on November 2, 2016, we announced the declaration of a distribution of $0.855 per limited partner unit, which will be payable on December 15, 2016. 
  Existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet working capital needs, debt service, partnership distributions and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: 
  We had $15.9 million in letters of credit, which are primarily in place to backstop insurance arrangements, outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of   September 25, 2016  .  We have no other significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 

Forward Looking Statements 
  Some of the statements contained in this report (including the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section) that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements as to our expectations, beliefs and strategies regarding the future.  These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Important factors, including those listed under Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, could adversely affect our future financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. 
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in Canada, and from time to time, on imported rides and equipment.  The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels.  We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 
  We manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt, interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt, and variable-rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Translation exposures with regard to our Canadian operations are not hedged. 
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of  Other comprehensive income (loss)  and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as  Net effect of swaps  in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Additionally, the  Other comprehensive income (loss)  related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap and reported as a component of  Net effect of swaps  in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  As of   September 25, 2016  , before reduction for debt issuance costs, we had $950.0 million of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and $602.9 million of variable-rate term debt.  After considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements, most of our outstanding  
  
    34 

     Table of Contents  

long-term debt represents fixed-rate debt.  Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $23.4 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in 30-day LIBOR on our variable-rate debt (not considering the impact of our interest rate swaps) would lead to an increase of approximately $6.1 million in annual cash interest costs. 
  Assuming a hypothetical 100 bps increase in 30-day LIBOR, the amount of net cash interest paid on our derivative portfolio would decrease by $4.9 million over the next year. 
  A uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would result in a $2.7 million decrease in annual operating income. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  (a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures -  
  The Partnership maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Partnership's management, with the participation of the Partnership's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 25, 2016  . 

(b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - 
  There were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 25, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
