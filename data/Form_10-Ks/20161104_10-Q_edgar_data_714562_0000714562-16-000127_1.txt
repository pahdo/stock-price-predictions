  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The accompanying   September 30, 2016   and   2015   consolidated financial statements are unaudited. The   December 31, 2015   consolidated financial statements are as reported in the First Financial Corporation (the  Corporation )   2015   annual report. The information presented does not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The following notes should be read together with notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

1. 
    Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  The significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting. All adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are of a normal recurring nature. The Corporation reports financial information for only   one   segment, banking. Some items in the prior year financials were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
    
  The Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan that was designed to align the interests of participants with the interests of shareholders. Under the plan, awards may be made based on certain performance measures. The grants are made in restricted stock units that are subject to a vesting schedule. These shares vest over   3   years in increments of   33%  ,   33%  , and   34%   respectively. In   2016   and   2015  ,   20,943   and   19,683   shares were awarded, respectively. These shares had a grant date value of   $677 thousand   and   $667 thousand   for   2016   and   2015  , vest over three years and their grant is not subject to future performance measures. Outstanding shares are increased at the award date for the total shares awarded.

The tables below presents the recorded investment in non-performing loans.  

There were   $216 thousand   of loans covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC included in loans past due over 90 days still on accrual  at   September 30, 2016   and there were   $37 thousand   at   December 31, 2015  . There were   $239 thousand   of covered

loans included in non-accrual loans at   September 30, 2016   and there were   $242 thousand   at   December 31, 2015  . There were no covered loans at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015   that were deemed impaired.  
    
  Non-performing loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. 
    
  The following tables presents the aging of the recorded investment in loans by past due category and class of loans.

     Table of Contents  

During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the terms of certain loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The following tables present the activity for TDR's.  

Modification of the terms of such loans typically include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. No modification in 2016 or 2015 resulted in the permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. Modifications involving a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan were for periods ranging from twelve months to five years. Modifications involving an extension of the maturity date were for periods ranging from twelve months to ten years. Troubled debt restructurings during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   did not result in any material charge-offs or additional provision expense. 
    
  The Corporation has no allocation of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 and $  36 thousand   allocated at September 30, 2015. The Corporation has not committed to lend additional amounts as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. The charge-offs during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not of any restructurings that had taken place in the previous 12 months. The impact on the provision for new troubled debt restructurings was immaterial.

Credit Quality Indicators: 
    
  The Corporation categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Corporation analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial loans, with an outstanding balance greater than   $100 thousand  . Any consumer loans outstanding to a borrower who had commercial loans analyzed will be similarly risk rated. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
    
  Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
    
  Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses which have clearly jeopardized repayment of principal and interest as originally intended. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some future loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
    
  Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded substandard, with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values. 
    
  Furthermore, non-homogeneous loans which were not individually analyzed, but are 90+ days past due or on non-accrual are classified as substandard. Loans included in homogeneous pools, such as residential or consumer may be classified as substandard due to 90+ days delinquency, non-accrual status, bankruptcy, or loan restructuring. 
    
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated are either less than   $100 thousand   or are included in groups of homogeneous loans. Beginning in July 2016, the Company s loan rating process no longer includes all loans in a loan relationship. Therefore, certain first lien mortgage loans and consumer loans that were previously rated in a loan relationship have been included in the not rated category as of September 30, 2016. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans are as follows:

    Securities 
       
  The amortized cost and fair value of the Corporation s investments are shown below. All securities are classified as available-for-sale.

     Table of Contents  

Contractual maturities of debt securities at   September 30, 2016   were as follows. Securities not due at a single maturity or with no maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed and equity securities are shown separately.   

There were   $13 thousand   and   $26 thousand   in gross gains and no losses from investment sales and calls realized by the Corporation for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   there were   $9 thousand   and   $23 thousand   in gross gains and no losses on sales and calls of investment securities.  

The following tables show the securities  gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities are generally evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC 320,   Investments - Debt and Equity Securities  . However, certain purchased beneficial interests, including non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, that had credit ratings at the time of purchase of below AA are evaluated using the model outlined in FASB ASC 325-40,   Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. 

19 

     Table of Contents  

When OTTI occurs under either model, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 
  Gross unrealized losses on investment securities were   $2.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $6.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . A majority of these losses represent negative adjustments to market value relative to the interest rate environment reflecting the increase in market rates and not losses related to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Based upon our review of the issuers, we do not believe these investments to be other than temporarily impaired. Management does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before their anticipated recovery. 
  There are three collateralized debt obligations securities with previously recorded OTTI but there is no additional OTTI recognized in   2016   or   2015  . 
  Management has consistently used Standard   Poors pricing to value these investments. There are a number of other pricing sources available to determine fair value for these investments. These sources utilize a variety of methods to determine fair value. The result is a wide range of estimates of fair value for these securities. The Standard   Poors pricing ranges from   38.75   to   46.66   while Moody Investor Service pricing ranges from   13.25   to   41.62  , with others falling somewhere in between. We recognize that the Standard   Poors pricing utilized is an estimate, but have been consistent in using this source and its estimate of fair value. 
    
  The table below presents a rollforward of the credit losses recognized in earnings for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

4. 
    Fair Value 
       
  FASB ASC No. 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
        
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) of identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level I prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  The fair value of most securities available for sale is determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 

20 

     Table of Contents  

For those securities that cannot be priced using quoted market prices or observable inputs a Level 3 valuation is determined. These securities are primarily trust preferred securities, which are priced using Level 3 due to current market illiquidity and certain investments in state and municipal securities. The fair value of the trust preferred securities is obtained from a third party provider without adjustment. As described previously, management obtains values from other pricing sources to validate the Standard   Poors pricing that they currently utilize. The fair value of state and municipal obligations are derived by comparing the securities to current market rates plus an appropriate credit spread to determine an estimated value. Illiquidity spreads are then considered. Credit reviews are performed on each of the issuers. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s state and municipal obligations are credit spreads related to specific issuers. Significantly higher credit spread assumptions would result in significantly lower fair value measurement. Conversely, significantly lower credit spreads would result in a significantly higher fair value measurements. 
    
  The fair value of derivatives is based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs). 

There were no transfers between levels of securities during 2016 and 2015.

The tables below presents a reconciliation and income statement classification of gains and losses for all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Impaired loans disclosed in footnote 2, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of collateral, are valued at Level 3. They are carried at a fair value of   $1.9 million  , after a valuation allowance of   $0.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and at a fair value of   $2.4 million  , net of a valuation allowance of   $1.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The impact to the provision for loan losses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the 12 months ended   December 31, 2015   was a   $17 thousand   decrease and a   $452 thousand   decrease for 2016 and a   $271 thousand   decrease for 2015, respectively. Other real estate owned is valued at Level 3. Other real estate owned at   September 30, 2016   with a value of   $2.8 million   was reduced   $1.0 million   for fair value adjustment. At   September 30, 2016   other real estate owned was comprised of   $2.5 million   from commercial loans and   $272 thousand   from residential loans. Other real estate owned at   December 31, 2015   with a value of   $3.5 million   was reduced   $743 thousand   for fair value adjustment. At   December 31, 2015   other real estate owned was comprised of   $2.8 million   from commercial loans and   $655 thousand   from residential loans.  
    
  Fair value of impaired loans is measured based on the value of the collateral securing those loans, and is determined using several methods. Generally the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. Appraisals for real estate generally use three methods to derive value: cost, sales or market comparison and income approach. The cost method bases value on the cost to replace current property. The market comparison evaluates the sales price of similar properties in the same market area. The income approach considers net operating income generated by the property and the investor s required return. The final fair value is based on a reconciliation of these three approaches. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis, a broker s opinion of value, the net present value of future cash flows, or an observable market price from an active market.  
    
  Fair value of other real estate is based upon the current appraised values of the properties as determined by qualified licensed appraisers and the Company s judgment of other relevant market conditions. Appraisals are obtained annually and reductions in value are recorded as a valuation through a charge to expense. The primary unobservable input used by management in estimating fair value are additional discounts to the appraised value to consider market conditions and the age of the appraisal, which are based on management s past experience in resolving these types of properties. These discounts range from   0%   to   50%  . Values for non-real estate collateral, such as business equipment, are based on appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers or the customers financial statements. Values for non real estate collateral use much higher discounts than real estate collateral. Other real estate and impaired loans carried at fair value are primarily comprised of smaller balance properties.

The following tables presents loans identified as impaired by class of loans, and carried at fair value on a non-recuring basis, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are all considered Level 3. 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are shown below. Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt and variable-rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully. Security fair values were described previously. For fixed-rate, non-impaired loans or deposits, variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, and for longer-term borrowings, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and considering credit risk. The valuation of impaired loans was described

previously. Loan fair value estimates do not necessarily represent an exit price. Fair values of loans held for sale are based on market bids on the loans or similar loans. It was not practicable to determine the fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  Fair value of debt is based on current rates for similar financing. The fair value of off-balance sheet items is not considered material. 

5. 
    Short-Term Borrowings 
       
  Period end short-term borrowings were comprised of the following:   

The Corporation enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase. The amounts received under these agreements represent short-term borrowings and are reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The securities underlying these agreements are included in investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has no control over the market value of the securities, which fluctuates due to market conditions. However, the Corporation is obligated to promptly transfer additional securities if the market value of the securities falls below the repurchase agreement price. The Corporation manages this risk by maintaining an unpledged securities portfolio that it believes is sufficient to cover a decline in the market value of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Employer Contributions 
    
  First Financial Corporation previously disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   that it expected to contribute   $2.7 million   and $  1.1 million   respectively to its Pension Plan and ESOP and   $262 thousand   to the Post Retirement Health Benefits Plan in 2016. Contributions of   $2.1 million   have been made to the Pension Plan thus far in 2016. Contributions of   $151 thousand   have been made through the first nine months of 2016 for the Post Retirement Health Benefits plan. No contributions have been made in 2016 for the ESOP. The Pension plan was frozen for most employees at the end of 2012 and for those employees there will be discretionary contributions to the ESOP plan and a 401K plan in place of the former Pension benefit. In the first nine months of   2016   and   2015   there has been   $1.2 million   and   $1.1 million   of expense accrued for potential contributions to these alternative retirement benefit options.

    New accounting standards 
       
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, amending ASU Subtopic 825-10. The amendments in this update make targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as follows: 1) Require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

recognized in net income.; 2) Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.; 3) Eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities.; 4) Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.; 5) Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.; 6) Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.; 7) Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.; and 8) Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Corporation has not yet made a determination of the impact on the financial statements of the provisions for ASU 2016-01. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases." Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases): 1) a lease liability, which is the present value of a lessee's obligation to make lease payments, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting under the new guidance remains largely unchanged as it is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. Leveraged leases have been eliminated, although lessors can continue to account for existing leveraged leases using the current accounting guidance. Other limited changes were made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the new revenue recognition standard. All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The intention is to require enough information to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. All entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. They have the option to use certain relief; full retrospective application is prohibited. The Corporation is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Some of the key provisions of this new ASU include: (1) companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. The guidance also eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. In addition, the guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity; (2) increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. The new guidance will also require an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance did not specify how these cash flows should be classified); and (3) permit companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Corporation is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016 ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), was issued and requires entities to use a current expected credit loss ("CECL") model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The entity's estimate would consider relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which will result in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses upon loan origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements

In August of 2016 ASU 2016-15 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)" ("ASU 2016-15") was issued and is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. The Corporation is assessing ASU 2016-15 but does not expect a significant impact on its accounting and disclosures.

    Acquisitions, Divestitures and FDIC Indemnification Asset 
       
  The Bank is party to a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC as a result of a 2009 acquisition.  Under the loss-sharing agreement ( LSA ), the Bank will share in the losses on assets covered under the agreement (referred to as covered assets). On losses up to   $29 million  , the FDIC has agreed to reimburse the Bank for   80 percent   of the losses. On losses exceeding   $29 million  , the FDIC has agreed to reimburse the Bank for   95 percent   of the losses. The loss-sharing agreement is subject to following servicing procedures as specified in the agreement with the FDIC. Loans acquired that are subject to the loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC are referred to as covered loans for disclosure purposes. Since the acquisition date the Bank has been reimbursed $  19.5 million   for losses and carrying expenses and currently carries an immaterial balance in the indemnification asset. The balance of loans covered by the loss share agreement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $5.7 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively. The only loans still covered by the loss share agreement are the single family loans; however recoveries on non-single family loans are still subject to sharing with the FDIC until 2017. 
    
  FASB ASC 310-30,   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,   applies to a loan with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination, acquired by completion of a transfer for which it is probable, at acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable. FASB ASC 310-30 prohibits carrying over or creating an allowance for loan losses upon initial recognition. The carrying amount of loans accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30 at   September 30, 2016   and    2015   are shown in the following table:

During the quarter ended March 31, 2016 the Corporation sold a significant portion of the assets and liabilities of the insurance operation for a gain of   $12.8 million  . Settlement of the transaction has been completed and the original gain was reduced by   $199 thousand   during the third quarter of 2016. The total assets, total revenues and net income of the insurance operation for 2015 were   $13.0 million  ,   $7.6 million   and   $168 thousand  , respectively. For 2014 they were   $15.8 million  ,   $8.3 million   and   $554 thousand  , respectively. The Corporation has chosen to focus its resources on the core banking activities. The sale of the insurance operations eliminated the goodwill of   $5.1   million from the original acquisition.

ITEMS 2. and 3.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The purpose of this discussion is to point out key factors in the Corporation s recent performance compared with earlier periods. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page three of this report. All figures are for the consolidated entities. It is presumed the readers of these financial statements and of the following narrative have previously read the Corporation s financial statements for   2015   in the 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date. The forward-looking statements are based on management s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the Corporation s ability to effectively execute its business plans; changes in general economic and financial market conditions; changes in interest rates; changes in the competitive environment; continuing consolidation in the financial services industry; new litigation or changes in existing litigation; losses, customer bankruptcy, claims and assessments; changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the Corporation s business; and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements is available in the Corporation s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of these filings are available at no cost on the SEC s Web site at www.sec.gov or on the Corporation s Web site at www.first-online.com. Management may elect to update forward-looking statements at some future point; however, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Certain of the Corporation s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, without limitation, changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of goodwill and valuing investment securities. See further discussion of these critical accounting policies in the   2015   Form 10-K. 

Summary of Operating Results 
    
  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  8.2 million  , compared to   $8.4 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Basic earnings per share increased to   $0.67   for the third quarter of   2016   compared to   $0.65   for same period of   2015  . Return on Assets and Return on Equity were   1.10  % and   7.23  % respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.14  % and   8.36  % for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  30.1 million  , compared to   $23.1 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Basic earnings per share increased to   $2.43   for the first nine months of   2016   compared to   $1.79   for same period of   2015  . Return on Assets and Return on Equity were   1.35  % and   9.56  % respectively, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.03  % and   7.61  % for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The primary components of income and expense affecting net income are discussed in the following analysis. 
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
        The Corporation's primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid for deposits and other sources of funds. Net interest income decreased $225 thousand in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $26.4 million   from   $26.6 million   in the same period in   2015  . The net interest margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is 4.05% compared to 4.12% for the same period of   2015  , a 0.07% decrease, driven by a greater increase in the costs of funding while income on earning assets decreased. Net interest income increased $72 thousand in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $78.6 million   from   $78.5 million   in the same period in   2015  . The net interest margin for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   is 4.05% compared to 4.04% for the same period of   2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Non-Interest Income 
    
       Non-interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $7.9 million   compared to   $10.0 million   for the same period of   2015  . Reduced insurance commission income of $1.7 million resulting from the sale of assets and liabilities of the insurance brokerage operation in the first quarter of 2016 is the main component of this decrease. Service charges on deposit accounts increased by $77 thousand. Non-interest income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $38.5 million   compared to   $29.8 million   for the same period of   2015  . Gain on the sale of assets and liabilities of the insurance brokerage operation of $12.8 million was the main component of this increase. 
    
  Non-Interest Expenses 
    
       The Corporation s non-interest expense for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by $2.1 million to   $22.0 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . Salaries and employee benefits decreased $2.1 million. A portion of the decrease related to reduced pension cost. The pension plan was frozen for the majority of employees as of December 31, 2012. Additional savings were realized with lower health insurance costs. The Corporation s non-interest expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by $5.3 million to   $68.1 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . Salaries and employee benefits decreased $5.5 million. The sale of a significant portion of the assets and liabilities of the insurance operation reduced the number of full time equivalent employees of the Corporation.  
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The Corporation s provision for loan losses increased $41 thousand to $1.09 million for the third quarter of    2016   compared to $1.05 million for the same period of   2015  . Net charge offs for the third quarter of   2016   were $1.5 million compared to $1.0 million for the same period of   2015  . The provision for loan losses decreased $1.3 million to $2.4 million for nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $3.6 million for the same period of   2015  . Net charge offs for the first nine months of   2016   were $3.2 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period of   2015  . Reduced non-performing loans at September 30, 2016 has reduced the need for the level of the allowance for loan losses thus reducing the amount of provision for loan losses relative to the same period of the previous year. 
    
  Based on management s analysis of the current portfolio, an evaluation that includes consideration of historical loss experience, non-performing loans trends, and probable incurred losses on identified problem loans, management believes the allowance is adequate to cover probable incurred losses.  
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  The Corporation s effective income tax rate for the first quarter of   2016   increased dramatically due to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the Forrest Sherer insurance operation which eliminated the goodwill of $5.1 million from the original acquisition. That goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes which had the effect of increasing the tax gain on the sale compared to the book gain, resulting in additional tax expense.  
    
  Non-performing Loans 
    
  Non-performing loans consist of (1) non-accrual loans on which the ultimate collectability of the full amount of interest is uncertain, (2) loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, and (3) loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest. Non-performing loans increased to $  26.3   million at   September 30, 2016   compared to $  25.5   million at   December 31, 2015  . Nonperforming loans decreased   3.3%   to $  26.3   million as of   September 30, 2016   versus $  27.6   million as of   September 30, 2015  . A summary of non-performing loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   follows:

Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity    
    
  First Financial Corporation has established risk measures, limits and policy guidelines for managing interest rate risk and liquidity. Responsibility for management of these functions resides with the Asset Liability Committee. The primary goal of the Asset Liability Committee is to maximize net interest income within the interest rate risk limits approved by the Board of Directors. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk    
    
  Management considers interest rate risk to be the Corporation s most significant market risk. Interest rate risk is the exposure to changes in net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Consistency in the Corporation s net interest income is largely dependent on the effective management of this risk. 
    
  The Asset Liability position is measured using sophisticated risk management tools, including earning simulation and market value of equity sensitivity analysis. These tools allow management to quantify and monitor both short-term and long-term exposure to interest rate risk. Simulation modeling measures the effects of changes in interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve and the effects of embedded options on net interest income. This measure projects earnings in the various environments over the next three years. It is important to note that measures of interest rate risk have limitations and are dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely predict the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, frequency and amount of interest rate changes as well as overall market conditions. The Committee has performed a thorough analysis of these assumptions and believes them to be valid and theoretically sound. These assumptions are continuously monitored for behavioral changes. 
    
  The Corporation from time to time utilizes derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Management continuously evaluates the merits of such interest rate risk products but does not anticipate the use of such products to become a major part of the Corporation s risk management strategy.

     Table of Contents  

The table below shows the Corporation s estimated sensitivity profile as of   September 30, 2016  . The change in interest rates assumes a parallel shift in interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points. Given a 100 basis point increase in rates, net interest income would increase   3.87  % over the next 12 months and increase   8.23  % over the following 12 months. Given a 100 basis point decrease in rates, net interest income would decrease   0.59  % over the next 12 months and decrease   2.09  % over the following 12 months. These estimates assume all rate changes occur overnight and management takes no action as a result of this change.  

Typical rate shock analysis does not reflect management s ability to react and thereby reduce the effect of rate changes, and represents a worst-case scenario. 
    
     Liquidity Risk 
    
       Liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers, and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Generally the Corporation relies on deposits, loan repayments and repayments of investment securities as its primary sources of funds. The Corporation has $  5.9   million of investments that mature throughout the next 12 months. The Corporation also anticipates $  134.3   million of principal payments from mortgage-backed securities. Given the current rate environment, the Corporation anticipates $  30.7   million in securities to be called within the next 12 months. The Corporation also has unused borrowing capacity available with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and several correspondent banks. With these many sources of funds, the Corporation currently anticipates adequate liquidity to meet the expected obligations of its customers. 
    
  Financial Condition    
    
  Comparing the first nine months of   2016   to the same period in   2015  , loans, net of  deferred loan costs, have increased $53.1 million to $  1.8   billion. Deposits remained stable at $  2.5   billion at   September 30, 2016   compared to $2.4 billion at   September 30, 2015  .  Shareholders' equity increased 3.3% or $13.3 million. This financial performance increased book value per share 7.8% to $  34.66   at   September 30, 2016   from $  32.16   at   September 30, 2015  . Book value per share is calculated by dividing the total shareholders' equity by the number of shares outstanding. 
    
     Capital Adequacy    
    
  The Federal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, joint agencies) establish regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Regulatory capital guidelines require that capital be measured in relation to the credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items using various risk weights. On January 1, 2015, the Basel 3 rules became effective and include transition provisions through January 1, 2019. Under Basel 3, Total capital consists of two tiers of capital, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 capital is further composed of Common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital.  
  Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes qualifying common shareholders  equity, retained earnings and certain minority interests. Goodwill, disallowed intangible assets and certain disallowed deferred tax assets are excluded from Common equity tier 1 capital.  
  Additional tier 1 capital primarily includes qualifying non-cumulative preferred stock, trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) subject to phase-out and certain minority interests. Certain deferred tax assets are also excluded.  
  Tier 2 capital primarily consists of qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, Trust Securities subject to phase-out and reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The Corporation s Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital.  
  To meet adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent and a Total capital ratio of 8.0 percent. A  well-capitalized  institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. BHCs must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent to be classified as  well capitalized.  Failure to meet the capital requirements established by the joint agencies can lead to certain mandatory and  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial position. Below are the capital ratios for the Corporation and lead bank.  
  The phase in of the capital conservation buffer will have the minimum ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital at 7%, the Tier 1 capital at 8.5% ant the total capital at 10.5% in 2019 when fully phased in. Currently the Corporation exceeds all of these minimums.

ITEM 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  First Financial Corporation s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   were effective in ensuring material information required to be disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis. Additionally, there was no change in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.
