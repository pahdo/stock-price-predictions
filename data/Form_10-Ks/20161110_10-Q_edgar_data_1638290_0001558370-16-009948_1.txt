CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. We use words such as  could,   may,   might,   will,   expect,   likely,   believe,   continue,   anticipate,   estimate,   intend,   plan,   project  and other similar expressions to identify some but not all forward-looking statements and include statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q concerning our pipeline of new models;   

our ability to continue our operating momentum, capture additional market share and deliver continued growth; expectations regarding driving margin expansion, sales increases and organic growth; our fiscal 2016 outlook and key growth initiatives; and our anticipated financial performance for fiscal 2017. Forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  

The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other important factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many important factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: general economic conditions, demand for our products, changes in consumer preferences, competition within our industry, our reliance on our network of independent dealers, our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our large fixed cost base, the successful introduction of our new products, and the other important factors described under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on September 9, 2016. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. 

Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New important factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

1.  OR  GANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS 

MCBC Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on January 28, 2000, as a Delaware holding company that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC; MasterCraft Services, Inc.; MasterCraft Parts, Ltd.; and MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the  Company . 

The Company is a designer and manufacturer of premium inboard tournament ski boats and luxury performance V-drive runabouts under the MasterCraft brand. The Company also leases a parts warehouse in the United Kingdom to expedite service, primarily to dealers and customers in the European Union. 

2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company's fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30, with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of 13 weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month.  

The information furnished in the condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and statements of financial position for the interim periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for financial information have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The June 30, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. However, management believes that the disclosures in these condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.   

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of October 2, 2016 and results of its operations, and its cash flows for the three months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 and statement of shareholders' equity for the three months ended October 2, 2016. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Our interim operating results for the three months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future operating quarters.  

There have been no changes in the Company's significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates for the three months ended October 2, 2016 as compared with the significant accounting policies described in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended June 30, 2016.

Follow-on Offering       In September 2016, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 4,600,000 shares of its common stock held by certain entities associated with Wayzata Investment Partners (collectively, the  Selling Stockholders ) at a public offering price of $10.25 per share (the  follow-on offering ). This included 600,000 shares sold by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters, which was exercised concurrently with the closing of the follow-on offering. The Company received no proceeds from the follow-on offering. The Company incurred $254 for offering expenses, which are reflected as a reduction to paid-in capital, and of which $72 were paid during the three months ended October 2, 2016. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards       In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  .  This ASU changes the measurement principle for inventories valued under the First-In, First-Out ( FIFO ) or weighted-average methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is defined by the FASB as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance is expected to have on its financial position or results of operations and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842). This guidance establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance is expected to have on its financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance is expected to have on its financial position or results of operations and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve the core principle, the guidance establishes the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligation in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also details the accounting treatment for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. Lastly, disclosure requirements have been enhanced to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB announced that the implementation date would be delayed by one year. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments and ASU 2014-09 are now for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is now permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this new guidance is expected to have on our financial position or results of operations and related disclosures.

5.  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following: 

6.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets.

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

The following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets: 

There were no financial assets or liabilities subject to fair value measurements at June 30, 2016. The Interest rate cap is valued utilizing pricing models taking into account inputs such as interest rates and notional amounts. Fair value measurements for the Company s interest rate cap are classified under Level 2 because such measurements are based on significant other observable inputs. There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the three months ended October 2, 2016. 

7.   LONG-TERM DEBT 

Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: 

In May 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Fifth Third Bank, as the agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto (the  Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement provided the Company with an $80,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $50,000 term loan (the  Term Loan ) and a $30,000 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and matures on May 26, 2021.   

As of October 2, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and $3,126 in borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2016. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by letters of credit. As of October 2, 2016 there were no specified letters of credit outstanding and $250 at June 30, 2016. As of October 2, 2016 and June 30, 2016, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $30,000 and $26,627, respectively, and unamortized deferred financing costs were $571 and $601, respectively.   

As of October 2, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company's total unamortized deferred financing costs were $1,406 and $1,500 respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. As of October 2, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.

8.   INCOME TAXES 

The Company s provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax earnings ( effective tax rate ) is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items.  During the three months ended October 2, 2016 the effective tax rate was 36.7%.  The rate was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate.   

9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

In June 2015, Malibu Boats, LLC ( Malibu ) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee alleging that the Company s Gen 2 Surf System and NXT Surf System infringe a Malibu patent relating to Malibu s wake surf technology. The complaint seeks trebled damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys  fees and an injunction against future infringement. In August 2015, the Company filed a motion with the court for summary judgment of noninfringement. In February 2016, the court denied the Company s summary judgment motion without prejudice to refiling after the court interprets the patent claims. The trial is scheduled for May 2017. Malibu filed a separate complaint alleging that the Company s Gen 2 and NXT Surf Systems infringe another patent in February 2016.  As with the previous complaint, Malibu is seeking damages and an injunction.  The trial in the second case is scheduled for October 2017.  The Company does not believe that Malibu s claims in either case have merit and we intend to defend against these claims vigorously. The Company currently cannot assess the probability of losses, or reasonably estimate the range of losses, related to this matter. 

10.   EARNINGS PER SHARE 

The following table sets forth the computation of the Company s earnings per share: 

For the three months ended October 2, 2016, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share included options to purchase 122,640  shares of common stock, 13,955 restricted stock awards and 17,216 performance stock units.  For the three months ended September 27, 2015, the weighted average shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share because their inclusion would have reduced the loss per share include options to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock, 724,721 restricted stock awards and warrants to purchase 456,213 shares of common stock.

During fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 the Company adopted the Amended and Restated MCBC Holdings, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan ( 2015 Plan ) in order to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentives to non-employee directors, employees, and consultants of the Company and certain of its affiliates and to enable the Company and certain of its affiliates to obtain and retain the services of these individuals, which is essential to our long-term success. In July 2015, the Board amended and restated the Company's 2015 Plan which became effective just prior to the closing of the Company s initial public offering to increase the shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. In August 2016, the Company granted to certain employees 28,391 shares of restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) under the 2015 Plan at a per share fair value of $11.85, which is the market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The RSAs will vest in three equal annual installments. In addition, the Company granted 10,770 RSAs under the 2015 Plan to certain non-employee directors for their annual equity award at a per share fair value of $11.85. During the three months ended October 2, 2016, the Company recognized $36 in stock-based compensation expense from these restricted stock awards 

In August 2016, the Company granted 42,587 performance stock units ( PSUs ) under its 2015 Plan to certain employees at a per share fair value of $11.85, which is the market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.  The awards will be earned based upon the Company s obtainment of certain performance criteria over a three-year period. The performance period for the awards are a three-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2019.  Following the determination of the Company s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based upon the application of a total shareholder return ( TSR ) modifier. The Company recognized $18 in stock-based compensation expense from these PSUs during the three months ended October 2, 2016. 

In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 non-qualified stock options ( NSOs )     to certain employees at an option price equal to the $15.00 per share of the Company s common stock, which was the initial public offering price, which will vest in 25% increments annually on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. In June 2016, the Company reduced the exercise price of these options by $4.30 per share, which was the amount of the special cash dividend paid in June 2016. Therefore, the exercise price of the options is now $10.70 per share. The other terms of the options remained unchanged. During the three months ended March 27, 2016, there were 15,146 stock options forfeited. We estimated the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes pricing model assuming a risk-free interest rate of 1.93%, an expected term of 6.25 years, no dividend yield and a volatility rate of 56.7%. The Company recognized from these NSOs $65 and $56 in stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  above and in  Risk Factors  set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We are a world-renowned innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium recreational sport boats, with a leading market position in the U.S., a strong international presence, and dealers around the world. Our boats are used for water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. Our robust product portfolio of performance sport boats are manufactured to the highest standards of quality, performance, and styling. 

We sell our boats through an extensive network of independent dealers in North America and internationally. We partner with 91 North American dealers with 144 locations and 43 international dealers with 56 locations throughout the rest of the world. For the three months ended October 2, 2016, 93.6% of our net sales were generated from North America and 6.4% of our net sales were generated from outside of North America. 

Outlook 

Our sales are impacted by general economic conditions, which affect the demand for our products, the demand for optional features, the availability of credit for our dealers and retail consumers, and overall consumer confidence. While the performance sport boat category has grown in recent years, new unit sales remain significantly below historical peaks. While there is no guarantee that our market will continue to grow, we believe that increased consumer demand and limited used boat inventory present a long runway for future growth.  

We believe our sales have grown as dealers and customers continue to recognize the superior quality, performance, styling, and value proposition of our recently released boats. We further believe that we are realizing the market share benefits from many initiatives that our new management team has implemented over the past few years. Our entire product portfolio has been renewed in the last four years, giving us the newest overall product offering in the performance sport boat category. We believe these factors strongly position us for growth in the coming periods. We believe our broad offering of boat models and features will continue to attract customers from our competitors, particularly in the performance sport boat and sterndrive categories, and will drive increased unit volume and market share gains. Our revamped manufacturing and product development processes have led to operational efficiencies which we expect will continue to drive significant margin expansion.

Recent Transactions 

Follow-on Offering   

In September 2016, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 4,600,000 shares of its common stock held by certain entities associated with Wayzata Investment Partners (collectively, the  Selling Stockholders ) at a public offering price of $10.25 per share (the  follow-on offering ). This included 600,000 shares sold by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters, which was exercised concurrently with the closing of the follow-on offering. The Company received no proceeds from the follow-on offering.  

Seasonality and Other Factors That Affect Our Business 

Our operating results are subject to annual and seasonal fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including: 

seasonal variations in retail demand for boats, with a significant majority of sales occurring during peak boating season, which we attempt to manage by providing incentive programs and floor plan subsidies to encourage dealer purchases throughout the year;     

product mix, which is driven by boat model mix and higher option order rates; while product mix does not significantly affect margins, sales of larger boats and boats with optional content produce higher absolute profits;     

inclement weather, which can affect production at our manufacturing facility as well as consumer demand;     

competition from other performance sports boat manufacturers;     

general economic conditions; and     

foreign currency exchange rates.     

Key Performance Measures 

From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These key performance measures include: 

Unit volume     We define unit volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period.     

Net sales per unit     We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit volume.     

Gross margin     We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage.     

Adjusted EBITDA     We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see  Non-GAAP Measures  below.     

Adjusted net income     We define Adjusted net income as net income excluding income taxes adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. For a reconciliation of Adjusted net income to net income, see  Non-GAAP Measures  below.

Components of Results of Operations 

Net Sales 

We generate sales from the sale of boats, trailers, and accessories to our dealers. The substantial majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of boats, including optional features included at the time of the initial wholesale purchase of the boat. Net sales consist of the following: 

Gross sales, which are derived from:     

Boat sales     sales of boats to our dealer network. In addition, nearly all of our boat sales include optional feature upgrades, which increase the average selling price of our boats; and     

Trailers, parts and accessories, and other revenues     sales of boat trailers, replacement and aftermarket boat parts and accessories, and transportation charges to our dealer network.     

Net of:     

Dealer programs and flooring subsidies     incentives, including rebates and subsidized flooring, we provide to our dealers to drive volume and level dealer purchases throughout the year. If a dealer meets certain volume levels over the course of the year during certain defined periods, the dealer will be entitled to a specified rebate. These rebates change annually and may include volume and exclusivity incentives. Dealers who participate in our floor plan financing program may be entitled to have their flooring costs subsidized by us to promote dealer orders in the offseason.     

Cost of Sales 

Our cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture our products, including raw materials, components, supplies, direct labor, and factory overhead. For components and accessories manufactured by third-party vendors, our costs are the amounts invoiced to us by the vendors. Cost of sales includes shipping and handling costs, depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and facilities, and warranty costs associated with the repair or replacement of our boats under warranty. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses include selling and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, impairment losses and amortization costs. These items include personnel and related expenses, non-manufacturing overhead, and various other operating expenses. Further, selling and marketing expenditures include the cost of advertising and marketing materials. General and administrative expenses include, among other things, salaries, benefits, and other personnel related expenses for employees engaged in product development, engineering, finance, information technology, human resources, and executive management. Other costs include outside legal and accounting fees, investor relations, risk management (insurance), and other administrative costs. 

Other Expense 

Other expense includes interest expense and change in common stock warrant fair value. Interest expense consists of interest charged under our credit facilities, including deferred financing fees and debt issuance costs written off in connection with the pay down of amounts owed on our credit facilities.

Table of Contents  

Income Tax Expense 

Our accounting for income tax expense reflects management s assessment of future tax assets and liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. We record a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 

Results of Operations    

The table below sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented. Our financial results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of the financial results that we will achieve in future periods. 

Three months ended October 2, 2016 Compared to Three months ended September 27, 2015 

Net Sales.    Net sales for the three months ended October 2, 2016, increased 8.4%, or $4.7 million to $60.7 million compared to $56.0 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth in unit volume of 36 units, or 5.3%, resulting mainly from an increase in calendar production days and the cadence of launch activity. Our net sales per unit increased by 3.0%, due primarily to price increases as well as increased sales of higher-end option packages.  

Cost of Sales.    Our cost of sales increased $2.8 million, or 7.0%, to $42.9 million for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to $40.1 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. The increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from a 5.3% increase in total unit volume and an increase in material costs of higher content option packages. 

Gross Profit.    For the three months ended October 2, 2016, our gross profit increased $2.0 million, or 12.4%, to $17.8 million compared to $15.8 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. Gross margin increased to 29.3% for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to 28.3% for the three months ended September 27, 2015. The 100   

18 

Table of Contents  

basis point increase in gross margin resulted primarily from increased sales of higher content option packages which increased average margins per unit, as well as continued efficiency gains driven by manufacturing improvements and leverage on increased sales. 

Operating Expenses.    Selling and marketing expense decreased $0.4 million, or 17.1%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease resulted mainly from the reduced spending on the MasterCraft Throwdown event. General and administrative expense decreased by $5.2 million, or 55.9%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to $9.3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease resulted mainly from $5.3 million in reduced stock-based compensation cost, partially offset by higher Malibu litigation costs during the three months ended October 2, 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 10.2% during the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to 21.1% for the three months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease was the result of the decrease in general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses described above. 

Other Expense.    Interest expense decreased for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 27, 2015. The decrease is a result of the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the debt extinguishment that occurred following our initial public offering in the three months ended September 27, 2015. Change in common stock warrant fair value for the three months ended October 2, 2016 decreased $3.3 million compared to the three months ended September 27, 2015, as all warrants were exercised during fiscal 2016. 

Income Tax Expense.    Our income tax expense was $4.0 million for the three months ended October 2, 2016, reflecting an effective tax rate of 36.7%.  Our effective tax rate during the three months ended October 2, 2016 differs from the 35% statutory rate primarily due to the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate. Our effective tax rate during the three months ended September 27, 2015 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the change in fair value of the common stock warrant. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including change in common stock warrant fair value, fees and expenses related to our initial public offering and follow-on offering and our stock-based compensation expense. We define Adjusted net income as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including change in common stock warrant fair value, fees and expenses related to our initial public offering and follow-on offering, our stock-based compensation expense, and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate.  We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of net income (loss) or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted net income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures.  We believe Adjusted net income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash and non-recurring items.  Adjusted

Table of Contents  

EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes;     

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and     

Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.     

In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP for the periods indicated: 

(a) 

Represents non-cash expense related to changes in the fair market value of our common stock warrant.     

(b) 

Represents fees and expenses associated with our follow-on offering and initial public offering.     

(c) 

Represents legal and advisory fees related to our litigation with Malibu Boats, LLC.

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital and fund capital expenditures. Our principal source of funds is cash generated from operating activities. As of October 2, 2016, we had borrowing availability of $30.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We believe our cash from operations, along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to provide for our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: 

Operating Activities 

Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.2 million, or 75.8%, for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 27, 2015, to $5.0 million from $2.9 million. This increase was primarily due to higher net income and a decrease in inventory partially offset by an increase in cash payments for income taxes. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.1 million, or 27.4%, for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 27, 2015. This decrease was due to timing of our capital expenditures. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used for financing activities was $4.4 million for the three months ended October 2, 2016 compared to a source of cash provided by financing activity of $4.4 million for the three months ended September 27, 2015. The cash used for financing activities for the three months ended October 2, 2016 related to payments of $1.2 million on our term loan, payments of $3.1 million made on our revolving credit facility and $0.1 million in payments of costs that were directly associated with the follow-on offering. 

Senior Secured Credit Facility.    In February 2016, we amended our credit and guaranty agreement (the  Senior Secured Credit Facility ) to provide that the Company may make share repurchases in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20 million during the period commencing February 18, 2016 and ending on the last day of the term of the Senior Secured Credit Facility.  

In May 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) with Fifth Third Bank. The Amended Credit Agreement replaces our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from March 2015. The Amended Credit Agreement provides us with an $80 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $50 million term loan and a $30 million revolving credit facility. We are required to make quarterly debt maturity payments on the term loan which will mature on May 26, 2021 at which time all remaining amounts   

22

outstanding thereunder will be due and payable. We used the proceeds from the term loan, cash on hand and our revolving credit facility to pay a $79.9 million cash dividend to common stockholders in June 2016.  

As of October 2, 2016, the current net revolving line of credit availability was $30.0 million and we were in compliance with all financial covenants and no event of default had occurred. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of October 2, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet financings. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory  say-on-pay  votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. 

The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not  emerging growth companies.  

We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a  large accelerated filer,  as defined under the Exchange Act. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

As of October 2, 2016, there were no significant changes in or changes in the application of our critical accounting policies or estimation procedures from those presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of October 2, 2016.  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 2, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART I  I   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

Legal Proceedings 

In June 2015, Malibu Boats, LLC ( Malibu ) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee alleging that the Company s Gen 2 Surf System and NXT Surf System infringe a Malibu patent relating to Malibu s wake surf technology. The complaint seeks trebled damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys  fees and an injunction against future infringement. In August 2015, the Company filed a motion with the court for summary judgment of noninfringement. In February 2016, the court denied the Company s summary judgment motion without prejudice to refiling after the court interprets the patent claims. The trial is scheduled for May 2017. Malibu filed a separate complaint alleging that the Company s Gen 2 and NXT Surf Systems infringe another patent in February 2016.  As with the previous complaint, Malibu is seeking damages and an injunction.  The trial in the second case is scheduled for October 2017.  The Company does not believe that Malibu s claims in either case have merit and we intend to defend against these claims vigorously. The Company currently cannot assess the probability of losses, or reasonably estimate the range of losses, related to this matter. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. 

During the quarter ended October 2, 2016, there were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K.
