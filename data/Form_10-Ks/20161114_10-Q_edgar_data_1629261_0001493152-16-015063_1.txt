Business
Organization    

Long
Island Iced Tea Corp, a Delaware C-Corporation ( LIIT ), was formed on December 23, 2014. LIIT was formed in order
to allow for the completion of mergers between Cullen Agricultural Holding Corp. ( Cullen ) and Long Island Brand
Beverages LLC ( LIBB ). On December 31, 2014, LIIT entered into a merger agreement, as amended as of April 23, 2015,
with Cullen, a public company, Cullen Merger Sub, Inc. ( Cullen Merger Sub ), LIBB Acquisition Sub, LLC ( LIBB
Merger Sub ), Long Island Brand Beverages LLC and the founders of LIBB ( Founders ). Pursuant to the merger
agreement, (a) Cullen Merger Sub was to be merged with and into Cullen, with Cullen surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary
of LIIT and (b) LIBB Merger Sub was to be merged with and into LIBB, with LIBB surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary
of LIIT (the  Mergers ). As a result of the merger which was consummated on May 27, 2015, LIIT consisted of its wholly
owned subsidiaries, LIBB (its operating subsidiary) and Cullen and Cullen s wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively the
 Company ).  

For
accounting purposes, the Mergers were treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB, as the former
LIBB members hold a large percent of the LIIT s shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15, the merger or acquisition of a private operating company
into a non-operating public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business
combination. As a result, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively
updated to reflect the recapitalization.  

Overview

The
Company is a holding company operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LIBB. The Company is engaged in the production and
distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic ready-to-drink ( NARTD ) iced tea in the beverage industry. The Company is currently
organized around our flagship brand Long Island Iced Tea, a premium NARTD tea made from a proprietary recipe and with quality
components. The Company s mission is to provide consumers with premium iced tea offered at an affordable price.  

The
Company aspires to be a market leader in the development of iced tea beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers.
There are two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on
the go are families, employees, students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding
schedules, there is a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals
who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from the less
healthy options, such as carbonated soft drinks, towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.  

During
the second quarter of 2016, the Company began selling aloe juices and commenced selling a private label version of its iced tea
product. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s aloe juice product accounted for approximately
35% and 23%, respectively, of the Company s consolidated net sales.  

The
Company sells its products to regional retail chains and to a mix of independent mid-to-large range distributors who in turn sell
to retail outlets, such as big chain supermarkets, mass merchants, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels, principally in
the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania markets. During 2016, the Company has also begun expansion into other geographic
markets, such as Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Nevada, Rhode Island and parts of the Midwest. The Company s
products are currently available in 12 states that have a cumulative population of 100 million people. The Company has also begun
to sell its products globally in regions such as South Korea and multiple Caribbean nations.

Liquidity
and Management s Plan    

The
Company has been focused on the development of its brand and its infrastructure, as well as in the establishment of a network
of distributors and qualified direct accounts. From inception, the Company has financed its operations through the issuance of
debt and equity, and through utilizing trade credit with its vendors.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has cash of $359,613 and short-term investments of $2,507,302. The Company incurred net losses
of $4,891,028 and $8,390,264 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. At September
30, 2016, the Company s stockholders  equity was $4,303,459. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working
capital of $3,116,734.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised net proceeds of $6,729,007 through the sale of 1,500,631 shares of
common stock and 230,475 warrants to purchase common stock.  

On
November 23, 2015, LIIT and LIBB entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), by and among
LIBB, as the borrower, LIIT and Brentwood LIIT Inc., as the lender. Brentwood LIIT Inc. s interest in the Credit Agreement
and the related agreements and instruments thereunder was subsequently transferred to Brentwood LIIT (NZ) Ltd. (the  Lender ).
Brentwood LIIT Inc. and the Lender are controlled by a related party, Eric Watson, who beneficially owned approximately 16% of
the Company on November 23, 2015 and 18.2% as of September 30, 2016. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility
in an initial amount of up to $1,000,000, subject to increases at the Lender s discretion as provided in the Credit Agreement
(the  Available Amount ), up to a maximum amount of $5,000,000 (which was subsequently reduced to $3,500,000 in connection
with the closing of the Offering, as defined below) (the   Facility Amount ). The Available Amount may be increased,
in increments of $500,000, up to the Facility Amount, and LIBB may obtain further advances, subject to the approval of the Lender.
On November 23, 2015 and December 10, 2015, LIBB obtained an aggregate of $1,000,000 in advances from the Lender, constituting
the full Available Amount at such time. On March 17, 2016, LIIT, LIBB and the Lender agreed to increase the Available Amount by
$500,000 to $1,500,000 and approved an additional $500,000 in advances. On March 24, 2016, LIBB obtained $250,000 of the approved
advance from the Lender and during May 2016, LIBB obtained the other $250,000 of the approved advances from the Lender, as a result
of which the Available Amount was borrowed in full.  

On
July 28 and 29, 2016, the Company sold 1,270,156 shares (the  Shares ) of common stock in a public offering (the  Offering )
at an offering price of $5.50 per share, pursuant to the Company s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-210669).
The sale of the Shares generated gross proceeds of $6,985,858 and net proceeds of $5,867,217 after deducting commissions and other
offering expenses. In connection with sale of the Shares, the Company s common stock was approved for listing on the NASDAQ
Capital Market under its current symbol,  LTEA.  The Offering was terminated on August 4, 2016. No further sales of
shares were made in the Offering.  

In
connection with the sale of the Shares, the Company completed a recapitalization transaction (the  Recapitalization )
with the Lender. Pursuant to the Recapitalization, the Lender converted all of the outstanding principal and interest ($1,669,376)
under the Credit Agreement into 421,972 shares of common stock and exchanged its warrant for 486,111 shares of common stock. As
of September 30, 2016, the balance under the Credit Agreement was $0.  

In
connection with the consummation of the Offering, on July 29, 2016, the selling agents were issued warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 31,522 shares of common stock. These warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $6.875
per share, commencing on January 14, 2017 and expiring on July 14, 2021. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants are subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar adjustments. The warrants contain
provisions for one demand registration of the sale of the underlying shares of common stock at the Company s expense, an
additional demand registration at the warrant holders  expense, and unlimited  piggyback  registration rights
at the Company s expense until July 28, 2021.  

On
October 12, 2016, the Company filed a  shelf  registration statement on Form S-3/A Amendment No. 1, under which the
Company may from time to time, sell any combination of debt or equity securities up to an aggregate initial offering price not
to exceed $50,000,000. (See Note 10   Subsequent Events)

Liquidity
and Management s Plan, continued    

The
Company believes that as a result of the commitment for financing from a stockholder and its working capital as of September 30,
2016, its cash resources will be sufficient to fund the Company s net cash requirements for the next twelve months from
the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. However, in order to execute the Company s long-term
growth strategy, the Company may need to raise additional funds through private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means.
There are no assurances that the Company will be able to raise such funds on terms that would be acceptable to the Company.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
result that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and related notes thereto included in the
Company s Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 22, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements, and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those
which result from using such estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to, assessing the
collectability of accounts receivable, accrual of rebates to customers, the valuation of inventory, determining the estimated
lives of long-lived assets, determining the potential impairment of intangibles, the fair value of warrants issued, the fair value
of stock options, the fair value of a beneficial conversion feature and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any
changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates
and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to
be necessary.  

Revenue
Recognition     

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers (see  Customer Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives, 
below). Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable; (2) evidence
of a binding arrangement exists (generally, purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance
required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered
to or picked up by the Company s customers.

Customer
Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives, continued    

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among
these programs are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for various discounts to the end retailers or
for participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to
ensuring volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace.  

In
addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued shares of common stock in the amounts
of 0 and 3,400, respectively, at a fair value of $4.00 per share, to customers and the owners of customers. Included in the costs
of these programs were costs associated with the fair value of shares issued, which totaled $0 and $26,221 for the three months
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $45,165 and $54,919 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Additionally,
the Company may be required to occasionally pay fees to its customers ( Placement Fees ) in order to place its products
in the customers  stores. In some cases, the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other
than the right to place the Company s product in the store of the customer. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction
of revenue. If, at the time the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations, the Company has cumulative negative
revenue with that particular customer, such negative revenue is reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0 and $11,087, respectively, of Placement Fees to
selling and marketing expense. No such Placement Fees were recorded in selling and marketing expense for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs    

Shipping
and handling costs incurred to move finished goods from the Company s sales distribution centers to customer locations are
included in selling and marketing expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and totaled $117,998 and $27,563
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $319,668 and $71,813 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Advertising    

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $84,433 and $29,130, respectively, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $114,980 and $155,623, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Research
and Development     

The
Company expenses the costs of research and development as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, research
and development expense related to new product initiatives were $0 and $46,667, respectively. These expenses were incurred pursuant
to a product development agreement, which will require the Company to pay $40,000 in cash and $40,000 in common stock upon the
completion of the arrangement. There were no research and development expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses are included within general and administrative expenses within the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2016, $50,000 was included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet related to this arrangement.  

Operating
Leases    

The
Company records rent related to its operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.

Restricted
Cash    

Pursuant
to the terms of the Credit Agreement with Lender, the Company was required to utilize $150,000 of certain $1,000,000 in proceeds
from the Credit Agreement for initiatives related to the development of an alcohol business. As of December 31, 2015, $127,580
of the Company s cash on hand was restricted for use in the development of an alcohol business. On March 17, 2016, LIBB
entered into an agreement with Lender whereby such restriction was lifted.  

Accounts
Receivable    

The
Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases directly to retailers, and extends credit, generally without requiring
collateral, based on its evaluation of the customer s financial condition. While the Company has a concentration of credit
risk in the retail sector, it believes this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves, including,
but not limited to, its type, geographic location, size, and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company s receivables
are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, accounts receivable have terms of net 30
days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its
history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the
Company s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.  

Accounts
receivable, net, is as follows:  

Concentrations of Credit Risk   

Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit with financial institutions, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. At times, the Company s cash in banks is in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limit. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits. These
cash balances are maintained with one bank. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was exposed to concentrations of credit risk
through short-term investments. As of September 30, 2016, three customers accounted for 25%, 11% and 11% of the Company s
trade receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for 14% and 30% of the Company s trade
receivables. The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. The Company
monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses, as required. 

Inventories    

The
Company s inventory includes raw materials such as bottles, sweeteners, labels, flavors and packaging. Finished goods inventory
consists primarily of bottled iced tea.  

The
Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of reserves. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a reserve of $28,615 and $41,790,
respectively, to reduce the cost of certain products to estimated net realizable value. The following table summarizes inventories
as of the dates presented:

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Major property additions, replacements, and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance
and repairs that do not extend the useful lives of an asset or add new functionality are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives of the Company s assets. The estimated
useful lives typically are 3 years for cold-drink containers, such as reusable fridges, wood racks, vending machines, barrels,
and coolers, and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each group of equipment, as
determined using the group-life method. Under this method, the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of individual
units of equipment when the disposal occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of refurbishing
its cold-drink containers and depreciates those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment or until
the equipment is retired. The estimated useful lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and are depreciated
on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives for trucks and automobiles are typically 3 to 5 years and are depreciated
on a straight line basis. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, depreciation expense was $39,420 and $27,043,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, depreciation expense was $117,118 and $76,578, respectively.
The Company disposed of one of its vehicles on July 18, 2016. In connection with the disposal, the Company recognized a loss of
$515.  

Intangible
Assets    

Intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that
there could be an impairment. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life
continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.  

Intangibles
assets with indefinite useful lives consist of the cost to purchase an internet domain name for $20,000. The domain name is considered
to have a perpetual life and as such, is not amortized. Insignificant costs incurred associated with renewing this asset are expensed
as incurred.  

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their expected useful life. Intangible assets with useful lives are tested
for impairment when circumstances indicate that there could be an impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include
website development costs of $3,741 and $7,494 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The estimated useful
life of the capitalized costs of the Company s website is 3 years and is depreciated on a straight line basis. As of September
30, 2016, the cost of the website development was $15,000 and the accumulated amortization was $11,259. As of December 31, 2015,
the cost of the website development was $15,000 and the accumulated amortization was $7,506. Amortization expense was $1,251 and
$1,251 for the three months ended 2016 and 2015, respectively and $3,753 and $3,753 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  

Deferred
Offering Costs    

The
Company capitalizes the costs related to proposed offerings of its equity instruments as deferred offering costs and records the
deferred offering costs as an offset to additional paid in capital upon the completion of the associated capital raising activity.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between
the financial statement, and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carry forwards will result in a benefit
based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction.  

In
its interim financial statements, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 270,  Interim Reporting  and ASC 740  Income
Taxes , whereby the Company utilizes the expected annual effective tax rate in determining its income tax provisions for
the interim periods. That rate differs from U.S. statutory rates primarily as a result of valuation allowance related to the Company s
net operating loss carryforward as a result of the historical losses of the Company.

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liabilities. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.
If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 -  Income Taxes . No uncertain tax
provisions have been identified. The Company accrues interest and penalties, if incurred, on unrecognized tax benefits as components
of the income tax provision in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Our primary tax jurisdictions
are our federal, various state, and local taxes. Generally, Federal, State and Local authorities may examine the Company s tax
returns for three years from the date of filing.  

In
accordance with ASC 740, the Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance should be established against the net deferred tax
assets based upon the consideration of all available evidence and using a  more likely than not  standard. Significant
weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The determination to record a valuation allowance is based on the
recent history of cumulative losses and current operating performance. In conducting the analysis, the Company utilizes an approach,
which considers the current year loss, including an assessment of the degree to which any losses are driven by items that are
unusual in nature and incurred to improve future profitability. In addition, the Company reviews changes in near-term market conditions
and any other factors arising during the period, which may impact its future operating results.  

Earnings
per share    

Basic
net earnings per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share reflect, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise
of stock options and warrants. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those dilutive securities with an exercise
price in excess of the average market price of the Company s common shares during the periods presented. The computation
of diluted earnings per share excludes outstanding options in periods where the exercise of such options would be antidilutive.  

Potentially
dilutive securities outlined in the table below have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because
the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments    

The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payable and other current liabilities,
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  

ASC
820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  

Fair
value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined
based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is
used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  

Level
3 Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.  

Fair
values for short-term money market investments are determined from quote prices in active markets for these money market funds,
and are considered to be Level 1.  

The
carrying value of financial instruments in the Company s consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 are as follows:  

Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets or Liabilities (Level 1)

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,  which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement
of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities
under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU
clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized
losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the
first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record
fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other
comprehensive income.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard
will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases).  Under the new guidance, at the
commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset, which is an asset that represents the
lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for
leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments
in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing,
and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would
not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors
may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.   

On
March 30, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . This update requires that all excess tax benefits
and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income
statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an
operating activity. In addition, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of
awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have
on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,
 Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will
have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,
 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). The core principal of ASU 2016-12
is the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update
are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

members. In exchange for the exclusive right to stock vending machines owned by Magnum, the Company agreed to reimburse Magnum
for the cost of products to stock the machines and the costs that Magnum incurred to acquire the machines including machines which
were purchased with an equipment loan. The total principal amount of the payments underlying the agreement upon inception was
$117,917. The reimbursements will be made in 35 monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $3,819 with an interest
rate of 10%. Upon completion of these payments in October 2018, Magnum will transfer ownership of the vending machines to the
Company. In addition, in exchange for the right to stock certain other vending machines that the Company has the right to use,
the Company agreed to purchase the products required to be displayed in those vending machines from Magnum, at a price equal to
Magnum s cost for such products. The Company may terminate the agreement and all obligations to make future payments on
ten days  written notice to Magnum. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the equipment

4   LINE OF CREDIT, continued   

The
credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate (3.5% at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016) plus 7.5%,
compounded monthly, and matures on November 23, 2018. Effective January 10, 2016, the Credit Agreement was amended such that interest
was compounded on a quarterly basis. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Credit Agreement provides for an additional
8% interest pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The outstanding principal and interest under the credit facility are payable
in cash on the maturity date. The Company also paid the Lender a one-time facility fee equal to 1.75% of the Facility Amount,
which was capitalized and added to the principal amount of the loan, and will pay the Lender $30,000 for its expenses at the maturity
date. The compounded interest and capitalized fees are excluded when determining whether the Available Amount has been exceeded.
The credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of LIIT and LIBB, including the membership
interests in LIBB held by LIIT. LIIT also has guaranteed the repayment of LIBB s obligations under the credit facility.
In addition, the credit facility will be guaranteed by Philip Thomas, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a director
of the Company, in certain limited circumstances up to a maximum amount of $200,000.  

The
proceeds of the credit facility may be used for purposes disclosed in writing to the Lender in connection with each advance.  

In
connection with the establishment of the credit facility, the Company issued a warrant to the Lender. The warrant entitled the
holder to purchase 1,111,111 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 and included a cashless
exercise provision. Also, as part of the Recapitalization, the warrant was exchanged for 486,111 shares of the Company s
common stock. (See  Induced Conversion  below for the accounting of the Recapitalization).  

The
Lender will have certain  piggyback  registration rights, on customary terms, with respect to the shares of the Company s
common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the credit facility and upon exchange of the warrant.  

The
proceeds of the credit facility may be used for purposes disclosed in writing to the Lender in connection with each advance.  

The
Lender may accelerate the credit facility upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including a failure to make a payment
under the credit facility when due, a violation of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and related documents, a filing
of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to LIBB or the Company or the occurrence of an event of default under
other material indebtedness of LIBB or the Company. The Company and LIBB also made certain customary representations, warranties
and covenants, including negative covenants with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
was in compliance with these covenants.  

Deferred
financing costs related to the Credit Agreement, which are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet,
are amortized over the three year term of the line of credit agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the net carrying amount of deferred
financing costs was $954,113. As of December 31, 2015, the gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs were $1,903,879
with accumulated amortization of $65,797.  

During
April 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the agreement with the Lender, which provided for the Recapitalization. Upon
a capital raise of at least $5,000,000, the Lender agreed to convert all of the outstanding principal and interest under the Credit
Facility into 421,972 shares of common stock (assuming all approved advances are completed and there are no further advances by
the Lender) at the closing of the Offering. In addition, the Lender agreed to exchange its 1,111,111 warrants for 486,111
shares of common stock at such time. The Credit Facility would remain outstanding except that the Facility Amount would be reduced
to $3,500,000. In connection with the reduction in the capacity of the Credit Facility, the Company recorded a charge of $408,000
to interest expense to reduce proportionally the unamortized deferred financing costs. Any amounts drawn from the Facility
Amount require lender approval. The Recapitalization was effectuated upon the closing of the Offering.  

In
addition, the Company and LIBB entered into an Amendment No. 1 (the  Registration Rights Amendment ) to the Registration
Rights Agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), dated as of December 3, 2015, by and among LIBB, the Company
and the Lender. The Registration Rights Amendment amended the Registration Rights Agreement, effective as of the closing of a
Qualified Public Offering, so that the  piggyback  registration rights granted to the Lender thereunder will apply
to the shares issuable in the Recapitalization.

Induced
conversion of the credit facility and the related warrants    

As
disclosed above, on July 29, 2016, as part of the Recapitalization, the outstanding balance and accrued interest on the
credit facility and the Lender s warrant to purchase 1,111,111 shares of the Company s common stock was
converted into a total of 908,083 shares of the Company s common stock. The Company accounted for this transaction as
an  induced conversion  in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 470-20-40-16.
The transaction qualifies as an inducement as the Company effectively lowered the exercise price of the warrant in order to induce
the holder to convert the debt and warrants to shares of common stock. The Company s purpose for the inducement was to
improve the Company s balance sheet and capitalization ahead of its proposed public offering.  

ASC
470-20-40-16 prescribes that, upon an induced conversion of convertible debt, the Company should recognize in earnings the difference
between (a) the fair value of the securities issued upon conversion and (b) the fair value of the securities that would have been
issued in accordance with the original conversion terms. The Company determined that during April 2016, the Company s
common stock had a fair value of $5.50 per share. During April 2016, the Company determined that its common stock did not have
sufficient trading volume for the market based trading price to be relied upon as a reliable measure of fair value. As such, the
Company needed to utilize another measure in order to determine fair value. The Company determined that the best measure of fair
value was the $5.50 price of shares issued upon the consummation of the Offering, which closed in July 2016. This fair value was
consistent with the range of pricing established with the Company s bankers ahead of the Offering, and aligned with the
fact that the inducement transaction would only be effected upon the closing of the Offering.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $1,587,954 related to the  induced
conversion , which is recorded on the Statement of Operations as loss on induced conversion of line of credit and warrants.
The induced conversion charge was measured as of April 2016, the date the agreement was reached, and recorded on July 29,
2016, the date the conversion was consummated. The charge was calculated as follows:

Legal
Proceedings    

The
Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion
of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal costs related to these matters are expensed
as they are incurred.  

On
August 1, 2014, an action was filed by LIBB in the Supreme Court in the State of New York entitled Long Island Brand Beverages
LLC v. Revolution Marketing, LLC ( Revolution ) and Ascent Talent, Model Promotion Ltd. LIBB is seeking damages of
$10,000,000 for several claims including breach of contract and fraud occurring during 2014. Revolution has filed a counterclaim
for breach of contract and related causes of action, claiming damages in the sum of $310,880, and seeking punitive damages of
$5,000,000. Ascent has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss LIBB s complaint. LIBB filed papers in opposition to the motion
to dismiss. In addition, Revolution has filed a motion to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent which were not
asserted in its original answer of record. On February 5, 2016, the Court rendered a decision, denying the motion to dismiss with
the exception of two claims which the Court dismissed. In the same decision, the Court granted a separate motion filed by Revolution
seeking to amend its answer to include cross claims against Ascent. The Company s management and legal counsel believe it
is too early to determine the probable outcome of this matter.

following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and footnotes
thereto contained in this quarterly report.   

Overview   

We
are a holding company operating through our wholly-owned subsidiary, LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of
premium Non-Alcoholic ready-to-drink ( NARTD ) iced tea in the beverage industry. We are currently organized around
our flagship brand Long Island Iced Tea, a premium NARTD tea made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components. Long
Island Iced Tea is sold in 12 states across the United States, primarily on the East Coast, through a network of national and
regional retail chains and distributors. Our mission is to provide consumers with premium iced tea offered at an affordable price.  

We
aspire to be a market leader in the development of iced tea beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are
two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are
families, employees, students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules,
there is a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming
more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from the less healthy options,
such as carbonated soft drinks, towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.  

In
addition, we have begun exploring global export opportunities, with product now distributed in South Korea and many Caribbean
nations. We have just announced a partnership with a Canadian distributor, who will help us to distribute our products through
Canada.  

We
were incorporated on December 23, 2014 in the State of Delaware. Our corporate offices are located at 116 Charlotte Avenue, Hicksville,
NY 11801 and our telephone number at that location is (855) 542-2832.  

Recent
Developments   

Public
Offering   

On
July 28 and 29, 2016, we sold 1,270,156 shares (the  Shares ) of common stock at a price of $5.50 per share, through
Network I Financial Services, Inc. acting as a selling agent on a  best efforts  basis, pursuant to the Company s
registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-210669) (the  Offering ).  

The sale of the shares generated gross
proceeds of $6,985,858 and net proceeds of $5,867,217 after deducting commissions and offering expenses. In connection with the
sale of the shares, the common stock was approved for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market under its current symbol,  LTEA. 
On August 4, 2016, the Offering was terminated. No further sale of shares were made in the Offering.  

As
part of our selling agent s compensation for the sale of the Shares, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 31,522 shares of common stock. The warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $6.875
per share, commencing on January 14, 2017 and expiring on July 14, 2021. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, stock
split or the Company s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. The warrants contain provisions for one
demand registration of the sale of the underlying shares of common stock at the Company s expense, an additional demand
registration at the warrant holders  expense, and unlimited  piggyback  registration rights at the Company s
expense until July 28, 2021.  

Credit
Agreement   

We
are party to a Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with LIBB, our wholly owned subsidiary, as the
borrower, and Brentwood LIIT (NZ) Ltd. (as successor in interest to Brentwood LIIT Inc.), as the lender (the  Lender 
or  Brentwood ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ).
The loans made by Brentwood under the credit facility are evidenced by a secured convertible promissory note (the  Lender
Note ). In addition, in connection with the establishment of the credit facility, the Company issued to Brentwood a warrant
(the  Lender Warrant ) to purchase 1,111,111 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, expiring
on November 23, 2018. The amount available to be advanced under the Credit Facility (the  Available Amount ) may be
increased from time to time, in increments of $500,000, up to a specified maximum (the  Facility Amount ), and we
may obtain advances under the Credit Facility, subject to the approval of Brentwood. As of immediately prior to the closing of
the Offering, the principal amount of loans outstanding, including capitalized interest and fees (both of which are excluded when
determining whether the Available Amount has been reached), was $1,669,376.  

Upon
the closing of the Offering, the Company completed a recapitalization transaction (the  Recapitalization ) with
the Lender. Pursuant to the Recapitalization, all of the outstanding principal and interest under the Lender Note was
converted into 421,972 shares of common stock and the Lender Warrant was exchanged for 486,111 shares of common stock. The
Company may continue to request advances under the credit facility subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit
Agreement, except that the Facility Amount was reduced from $5,000,000 to $3,500,000. Brentwood is owned by Eric Watson, who
as of November 11, 2016 beneficially owned approximately 18.2% of our outstanding common stock, and KA#2 Ltd., which
as of November 11, 2016 beneficially owned approximately 4.8% of our outstanding common stock.  

UBS
Credit Line   

On
October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a credit line (the  UBS Credit Line ) with UBS Bank USA ( UBS ).
The UBS Credit Line has a borrowing capacity of $1,300,000 and bears interest at a floating rate, depending on the time
requested for the borrowing. The interest is based on the ICE Swap Rate plus a margin of between 0.40% and 0.70%. As of November
11, 2016, the interest rate on the UBS Credit Line was 3.089%. The UBS Credit Line is collateralized by certain
of the Company s short-term investments. As of November 10, 2016, $400,000 was outstanding on the UBS Credit Line.  

Private
Issuances   

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Offering, the Company issued 1,667 shares of common stock to Julian Davidson, the Company s Executive
Chairman, 10,000 shares of common stock to Richard Allen, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, and 5,000 shares of common
stock to John Carson, a member of the Company s advisory board, as compensation for services to the Company.  

Intellectual
Property   

On
April 19, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the  USPTO ) registered our mark  Long Island
Iced Tea  (Registration No. 4,943,056 on the supplemental register). Registration on the supplemental register allows the
use of the   symbol, blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks, and allows us to sue infringers in federal
court, which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the supplemental register does not provide
all the protection of a registration on the principal register. As with any other registered mark, we may be open to claims of
others contesting the trademark.  

Board
of Directors and Strategic Advisory Board   

The
Company has established a Strategic Advisory Board of business and industry professionals to help guide the Company s business
and market development. On March 31, 2016, the Company added Bert Moore to its Advisory Board.  

On
April 1, 2016, the board of directors (the  Board ) of the Company adopted a resolution expanding the size of the
Board from five to six directors and appointed Tom Cardella as a Class 2 director (with a term expiring in 2017) to fill the newly
created directorship.  

Highlights   

We
generate income through the sale of our beverage products. The following are highlights of our operating results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Margin .
    Our margin decreased by 6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
    30, 2015. Our margin decreased by 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September
    30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the fact that, from May 2015 through January 2016, we introduced five of our flavors
    in gallon containers. Sales of our gallon containers have and continue to be sold below their costs. As a result, our margins
    during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 were negatively
    impacted by $18,667 (approximately 1% of net sales) by the inclusion of gallon container sales into our sales mix. In addition,
    as of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $28,615 to reduce the cost of certain products to estimated net
    realizable value. These negative factors were partially offset by sales through vending machines which typically carry higher
    margins.   

Operating
    expenses . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating expenses were $2,831,769, representing an increase
    of $1,813,770 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our
    operating expenses were $5,989,636, representing an increase of $3,730,656 as compared to the nine months ended September
    30, 2015. The increases in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 related primarily to
    increased payroll (including stock based compensation), increases in Advisory Board and Board of Directors fees, increases
    in legal and consulting expenses and an increase in printing and filing fees due to being a public company.   

Historically,
our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. Accordingly, we have historically financed our
business through the sale of equity interests or through the issuance of promissory notes and we have a commitment of financing
from a stockholder. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cash flows used in operating activities were $4,565,828,
our net cash used in investing activities was $2,516,799 and our net cash provided by financing activities was $7,235,048. We
had a working capital of $3,116,734 as of September 30, 2016.  

In
order to execute our long-term growth strategy, we may need to continue to raise additional funds through private equity offerings,
debt financings, or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all.  

Uncertainties
and Trends in Our Business   

We
believe that the key uncertainties and trends in our business are as follows:  

We
    believe that using various marketing tools, which may include significant advertising expenses, will be necessary in order
    to increase product awareness in order to compete with our competitors, including large and well established brands with access
    to significant capital resources.   

Customer
    trends and tastes can change for a variety of reasons including health consciousness, government regulations and variation
    in demographics. We will need to be able to adapt to changing preferences in the future.   

Our
    sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing and future customers who may generate substantial
    portions of our revenue, which includes sales to retailers where there may be concentrations.   

Our
    sales are subject to seasonality. Our sales are typically the strongest in the summer months in the northeastern United States.   

We
    are currently involved in litigation. Please refer to Item 1 of Part II of this quarterly report. There are no assurances
    that there will be successful outcomes to these matters.   

We
    developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. The Company s gallon product line has previously
    been sold below cost. There are no assurances we will be successful in increasing the margins on this product line.   

Please
refer to risks factors described in Item 1A of Part II of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2016.  

Accounting
Policies   

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP )
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in these consolidated financial statements. We believe that,
of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly
report), the following policies are the most critical.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers. Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions
are met: (1) the price is fixed and determined; (2) evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally, purchase orders); (3)
products have been delivered and there is no future performance required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment
terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by the Company s customers.  

Customer
Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives   

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among
these programs are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for
participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to ensuring
volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace. The costs of all these various programs are recorded as a reduction of
sales in the financial statements.  

Additionally,
the Company may be required to occasionally pay fees to its customers ( Placement Fees ) in order to place its products
in the customers  stores. In most cases, the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other
than the right to place the Company s product in the customers  stores. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction
of sales. If, at the time the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations, the Company has cumulative negative
sales with that particular customer, such negative sales are reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    

Net
Sales and Gross Profit   

Net
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $844,338, or 184.84%, to $1,301,125 as compared to $456,787 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due to a combination of brand momentum and an increase in distribution.
The increase was also bolstered by the sale of the Company s product line in gallon containers and the Company s aloe
juice product. Net sales of our product in gallons during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $281,885 and
were $368,165 as compared to $86,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We also began selling certain aloe juice products
in the first quarter of 2016. Sales of these products were $464,114 during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $40,154, or 63%, to $104,335 as compared to $64,181 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage decreased by 6% to 8% for the three months ended September 30,
2016 from 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross margin was due to (a) selling our gallon containers
at or below costs to certain distributors in order to acquire more shelf space at certain retailers; (b) an increase in costs
to produce certain new package offerings for our 20 ounce product line; and (c) introductory pricing given to new customers on
our 20 ounce product line during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

General
and administrative expenses   

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1,523,734, or 236%, to $2,170,522 as compared
to $646,788 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s
general and administrative salaries increased by $336,608 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition,
the Company incurred $882,267 in stock-based compensation expense that was allocated to general and administrative expense during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $776,527 over the $105,740 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. This was primarily the result of officers  salaries including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was caused primarily
by increases in rent, insurance, and other administrative costs.  

Selling
and marketing expenses   

Selling
and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $290,036, or 78%, to $661,247 as compared to
$371,211 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased largely due to an increase in
costs of $91,698 for freight out, consistent with the increase in units sold as compared to the prior period. There was also an
increase in selling salaries of $79,557 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015 due to an increase in efforts to sell the Company s products. The Company also incurred $68,672 in connection
with the in-store deployment of point of sale marketing materials during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Interest
expense   

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $578,838, or 66,381%, to $579,710 as
compared to $872 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the Credit Facility
with Brentwood interest through July 28, 2016 and the related amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the
agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $408,000 to reduce the
deferred financing costs proportionally with the reduction of the credit facility.  

Loss
on induced conversion of credit facility and warrants   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $1,587,954 for an induced conversion of its
credit facility and related warrants. No such charge was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due to a combination of brand momentum and an increase in distribution.
The increase was also bolstered by the sale of the Company s product line in gallon containers and the Company s aloe
juice product. Net sales of our product in gallons during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $801,180 and were
$957,398 as compared to $156,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the Company purchased vending machines
in the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales of our iced tea products in vending machines as well as other products purchased from vendors
were $149,933 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
We also began selling certain aloe juice products in the first quarter of 2016. Sales of these products were $795,733 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit decreased by $132,838, or 45%, to $159,683 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $292,521 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Our gross profit percentage decreased by 16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross margin was due to (a) selling our gallon containers at or below
costs to certain distributors in order to acquire more shelf space at certain retailers; (b) an increase in costs to produce certain

to $1,264,436 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s
general and administrative salaries and stock-based compensation increased by $1,416,936 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. This was primarily the result of the increase in the Chief Executive Officer s salary, which took place
on May 27, 2015 in connection with the consummation of the business combination between us, LIBB and Cullen. Legal and professional
fees increased by $283,101 which included increased accounting and legal costs related to our SEC report filings. Additionally,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $46,667 related to the costs of its alcohol development
contract. The remainder of the cost increases primarily related to rent and storage fees, insurance costs, website and internet
costs, press release costs and filing fees related to becoming a public company on May 27, 2015, and increases in depreciation
expense related to the purchase of vending machines in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Selling
and marketing expenses   

Selling
and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1,037,329, or 104%, to $2,031,873 as compared
to $994,544 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased largely due to increased selling
salaries of approximately $348,497 primarily related to the hiring of new employees, including a national vice president. Included
in this amount was $30,000 of stock based compensation to this employee. In addition, stock based compensation allocated to selling
and marketing expenses related to stock options increased by $84,231. Additionally sales commissions paid to brokers increased

by $247,855 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased
volume as well as increased freight rates resulting from shipments from a storage facility located in Georgia. The remainder of
the increase was caused by various other marketing expenses.  

Interest
expense   

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $929,371, or 1,975%, to $976,427 as compared
to $47,056 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the Credit Facility with Brentwood
and the related amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the agreement. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $408,000 to reduce the deferred financing costs proportionally with the reduction
of the credit facility.  

Loss
on induced conversion of credit facility and warrants   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $1,587,954 for an induced conversion of its
credit facility and related warrants. No such charge was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Sources
of Liquidity   

The
Company has historically been financed by debt from its stockholders and unrelated third parties. In addition, the Company has
also been financed by the sale of equity interests. We had working capital of $3,116,734 as of September 30, 2016. We believe
that, as a result of proceeds from the Offering, the commitment of financing from a stockholder and our working capital as of
September 30, 2016, we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our net cash requirements through November 14, 2017.  

The
following is an overview of our borrowings as of September 30, 2016:  

*
On July 29, 2016, all outstanding principal and interest under the line of credit was converted into 421,972 shares of common
stock in connection with closing of the Offering. No further draws have been made under the line of credit.  

Below
is a summary of our financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In order to execute our long-term growth
strategy, which could include the expansion of the business to include alcoholic beverages, we may need to continue to raise additional
funds through private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise
such funds on acceptable terms or at all.  

2016
Financing Activity    

Commencing
on November 24, 2015 and ending on March 14, 2016, we conducted a private placement of up to $3,000,000 of units (the  November
Offering ) on a  best efforts  basis through a placement agent (the  Placement Agent ). From January
1, 2016 to March 14, 2016, we raised gross proceeds of $686,900, through the sale of 171,725 units at $4.00 per unit. In a separate
private offering, we also raised gross proceeds of $235,000, through the sale of 58,750 units at $4.00 per units, during March
2016 (the  March Sales ). Each unit issued in the November Offering and in the March Sales consists of one share of
common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Included in the proceeds for the March Sales were subscriptions
receivable of $120,000, which were collected during April 2016.  

On
March 17, 2016, Brentwood approved an increase of $500,000 in the Available Amount under the Credit Agreement and approved advances
in the same amount. On March 24, 2016, an advance of $250,000 was received by the Company, and an additional advance of $250,000
was received during May 2016. In connection with the closing of the Offering, we completed the Recapitalization with Brentwood.
Pursuant to the Recapitalization, all of the outstanding principal and interest under the Brentwood Note was converted into 421,972
shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the principal amount of loans outstanding was $0.  

On
July 28 and 29, 2016, we sold 1,270,156 Shares in the Offering. The sale of the Shares generated gross proceeds of $6,985,858
and net proceeds of $5,867,217 after deducting commissions and other offering expenses. On August 4, 2016, the Offering
was terminated. No further sales of shares were made in the Offering.  

2015
Borrowing Activity    

On
November 23, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving Credit Facility. The Available
Amount under the Credit Facility may be increased from time to time, in increments of $500,000, up to a maximum Facility Amount
of $3,500,000, and we may obtain further advances, subject to the approval of Brentwood. The loans under the Credit Agreement
are evidenced by the Lender Note. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are to be used for the purposes disclosed in writing to
Brentwood in connection with each advance. Brentwood had approved an Available Amount of $1,000,000 and had made advances to us
in the same amount as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the loans under the Credit Facility,
including capitalized interest and fees as described below (both of which are excluded when determining whether the Available
Amount has been reached), was $1,091,571.  

The
Credit Facility bears interest at rate equal to the prime rate plus 7.5% (11% at September 30, 2016), compounded quarterly, and
matures on November 23, 2018. The outstanding principal and interest under the Credit Facility are payable in cash on the maturity
date. We also paid Brentwood a one-time facility fee equal to 1.75% of the Facility Amount, which was capitalized and added to
the principal amount of the loan, and will pay Brentwood $30,000 for its expenses at the maturity date. The Credit Facility is
secured by a first priority security interest in all of our property, including the membership interests in LIBB held by us. We
also have guaranteed the repayment of LIBB s obligations under the Credit Facility. In addition, LIBB s obligations
are guaranteed by Philip Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer, in certain limited circumstances, up to a maximum of $200,000.  

Brentwood
may accelerate the amounts due under the Credit Facility upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including a failure
to make a payment under the credit facility when due, a violation of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and related
documents, a filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to us or the occurrence of an event of default under
other material indebtedness of ours. The Company and LIBB also made certain customary representations and warranties and covenants,
including negative covenants with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness.  

Brentwood
may elect to convert the outstanding principal and interest under the Lender Note into shares of our common stock at a conversion
price of $4.00 per share. The conversion price and the shares of common stock or other property issuable upon conversion of the
principal and interest are subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or reclassification
of our common stock, or in the event of a fundamental transaction.  

In
addition, in connection with the establishment of the Credit Facility, we issued the Lender Warrant to Brentwood. The Lender Warrant
entitled the holder to purchase 1,111,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 and includes a cashless exercise
provision. Upon the closing of the Offering, pursuant to the Recapitalization, the Lender Warrant was exchanged for 486,111 shares
of common stock.  

Brentwood
will have certain  piggyback  registration rights, on customary terms, with respect to the shares of our common stock
issued or issuable upon conversion of the Lender Note and upon exchange of the Brentwood Warrant.  

On
November 23, 2015, the Company entered into a reimbursement agreement with Magnum Vending Corp., or  Magnum,  an entity
managed by Philip Thomas, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, and certain of his family
members. In exchange for the exclusive right to stock vending machines owned by Magnum, the Company agreed to reimburse Magnum
for certain costs that Magnum incurred to acquire the machines including machines which were purchased with an equipment loan.
The total principal amount of the payments underlying the agreement upon the inception of the agreement was $117,917. The reimbursements
will be made in 35 monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $3,819 with an interest rate of 10%. Upon completion
of these payments in October 2018, Magnum will transfer the vending machines to the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the total
principal amount of the payments underlying the agreement was $117,917 and we had made principal and interest payments of $6,463
under the agreement.  

On
April 28, 2015, LIBB received $150,000 as proceeds from a loan from Bass Properties, LLC, or  Bass Properties,  which
was at the time a stockholder of Cullen and member of LIBB. On May 4, 2015, LIBB received $400,000 as proceeds from a loan with
Ivory Castle Limited, or  Ivory Castle,  which was at the time a member of LIBB. These notes bore interest at 6% per
annum and were to mature on July 31, 2016. On June 30, 2015, these loans, together with accrued interest, a total of $555,910
were converted into 138,979 shares of the Company s common stock.  

On
March 26, 2015, LIBB received $250,000 as proceeds from an additional loan from Cullen, bearing interest at 6% per annum with
principal and interest due and payable on March 15, 2016. This loan was eliminated when consolidating the financial statements.  

2015
Private Placements    

On
June 30, 2015, we received net proceeds of $468,468 through the issuance of 117,636 shares of common stock at an average price
of approximately $4.00 per share.  

On
July 8, 2015, we received proceeds of $100,000 through the issuance of 25,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.00 per share.  

Commencing
on August 10, 2015 and ending on October 30, 2015, we conducted a private placement of up to $3,000,000 of units (the  August
Offering ), at a price of $4.00 per unit, through a placement agent. During the private placement, we sold an aggregate
of 155,750 units for total gross proceeds of $623,000. The units consisted of one share of common stock (or an aggregate of 155,750
shares) and one warrant (or an aggregate of 155,750 warrants). Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common
stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, expiring on September 17, 2018.  

On
November 24, 2015, we commenced the November Offering of up to $3,000,000 of units, at a price of $4.00 per unit, through a placement
agent. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold an aggregate of 18,250 units for total gross proceeds of $73,000 in the private placement.
The units consisted of one share of common stock (for an aggregate of 18,250 shares) and one warrant (for an aggregate of 18,250
warrants). Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, expiring
on November 30, 2018. We made additional sales in the November Offering after December 31, 2015, as described above under  2016
Financing Activity .  

Net
proceeds after all direct costs related to the August Offering and the November Offering, including the value of warrants issued
to the placement agent in the offerings, were $540,946 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

2015
Business Combination    

On
May 27, 2015, we completed the business combination contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December
31, 2014, as amended, by and among us, Cullen, Cullen Merger Sub, Inc., LIIT Acquisition Sub, LLC, LIBB, and Phil Thomas and Thomas
Panza. Prior to the closing of the business combination, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cullen formed solely for the purpose
of consummating the business combination, LIBB was a private operating company and Cullen was a public company seeking alternative
strategic opportunities in all industries and regions in an effort to maximize stockholder value. Upon the closing of the business
combination, we became the new public company and Cullen and LIBB became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours. As a result of the
consummation of the business combination, we gained access to the cash held by Cullen of $120,841. Under the agreement, upon consummation
of the business combination, the holders of the LIBB membership interests received 2,633,334 shares of our common stock, subject
to adjustment based on LIBB s and Cullen s net working capital at the closing. On July 16, 2015, the payment of the
net working capital adjustment under the agreement was waived by the parties.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under
the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by paragraph (b)
of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive) and Chief Financial Officer
(our principal financial officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in paragraph (e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2016 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as
described below  

A
material weakness is defined within the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s Auditing Standard No. 5, as a deficiency
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. We determined that our internal control of financial reporting had the following material weakness:  

Due
    to the small size of the Company, the Company does not maintain sufficient segregation of duties to ensure the processing,
    review and authorization of all transactions including non-routine transactions.   

Because
disclosure controls and procedures include those components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, management determined that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result
of the foregoing material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company is evaluating this weakness to
determine the appropriate remedy.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

On
September 19, 2016, James Meehan resigned as the Chief Accounting Officer and Secretary of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. Richard
B. Allen, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, assumed the duties of the Company s principal accounting officer.  

There
have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the current fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

We
are involved in various claims and legal actions arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion
of our management, the ultimate disposition of these matters in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In
addition, we are involved in the following legal action:  

Revolution
    Marketing, LLC . On August 1, 2014, an action was filed by LIBB in the Supreme Court in the State of New York entitled
    Long Island Brand Beverages LLC v. Revolution Marketing, LLC and Ascent Talent, Model Promotion Ltd. LIBB is seeking damages
    of $10,000,000 for several claims including breach of contract and fraud occurring during 2014. Revolution has filed a counterclaim
    for breach of contract and related causes of action, claiming damages in the sum of $310,880, and seeking punitive damages
    of $5,000,000. Ascent has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss LIBB s complaint. LIBB filed papers in opposition to
    the motion to dismiss. In addition, Revolution has filed a motion to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent
    which were not asserted in its original answer of record. On February 5, 2016, the Court rendered a decision, denying the
    motion to dismiss with the exception of two claims which the Court dismissed. In the same decision, the Court granted a separate
    motion filed by Revolution seeking to amend its answer to include cross claims against Ascent. Our management and legal counsel
    believe it is too early to determine the probable outcome of this matter.
