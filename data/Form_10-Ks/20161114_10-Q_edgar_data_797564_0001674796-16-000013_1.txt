  NOTE 1     ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES  
   
 The Company was incorporated on April 11, 1984 under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name of NT Holding Corporation. The Company has made several acquisitions and disposals of various business entities and activities. On May 9, 2008, the Company entered into a Merger and share exchange agreement with Health Source Technologies, Inc. This business acquisition has been accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of Health Source Technologies, Inc. At the time of the merger NT Holding Corporation had disposed of its assets and liabilities and had minimal operations and was considered a development stage company. Immediately after the acquisition the Company changed its name to HST Global, Inc. Health Source Technologies, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 6, 2007. The Company is currently headquartered in Hampton, Virginia. 
   
 HST Global, Inc. is an integrated Health and Wellness Biotechnology company that is developing and/or acquiring a network of Wellness Centers worldwide with the primary focus on homeopathic and alternative treatments of late stage cancer and other life threatening diseases.  In addition, the Company intends to acquire innovative products for the treatment of life threatening diseases. The Company primarily focuses on homeopathic and alternative product candidates that are undergoing or have already completed significant clinical testing for the treatment of late stage cancer and/or life threatening diseases. 
   
  NOTE 2     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying financial statements and related notes include the activity of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (   U.S. GAAP   ) and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (   SEC   ) to Form 10-K.   
   
  Interim Financial Statements  
   
 These interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company   s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period. 
   
  Accounting Method  
   
 The Company   s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting.  The Company has elected a December 31 year-end. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Page 6 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 We maintain cash balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, which do not currently exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. 
    
  Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share  
   
 The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive. The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2015 and 2016. 
   
  Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The Company adopted ASC 718,     Stock Compensation   ,  upon inception at August 6, 2007. Under ASC 718, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not issued any employer stock options. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The Company adopted ASC 820 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under this standard certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and disclosures are required for items measured at fair value. 
   
 The Company currently does not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company   s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows: 
   
 Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. The fair value of the Company   s cash is based on quoted prices and therefore classified as Level 1.   
   
 Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
   
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial statements. The Company   s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company   s financial statements. 

Page 7 
   
  NOTE 3     GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company   s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 Management   s plan to support the Company in its operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If the Company does not raise all of the money it needs from public offerings, it will have to find alternative sources, such as a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from its officers, directors or others. If the Company requires additional cash and is unable to raise it, it will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or cease business entirely. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 4     NOTES PAYABLE     RELATED PARTIES  
   
 As of December 31, 2015 the Company owed $1,299,469 to related parties. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $17,400 in additional cash loans from a related party, leaving a balance of $1,316,869 as of September 30, 2016. Of this total, $595,800 is unsecured, bears interest at 6 percent per annum, and is due on demand; $200,000 is unsecured, bears a flat owed interest amount of $46,000, and is due on demand; and the remaining $471,569 is unsecured, bears no interest, and is due on demand. 
   
 Included in the related party notes payable balance is a $50,000 penalty fee associated with one of its related party notes due to nonpayment. 
   
  NOTE 5     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
  Executive Offices  
   
 The Company's executive offices are located at 150 Research Dr., Hampton VA. These offices are leased by The Health Network, Inc. ( THN ), of which Ron Howell is President. THN allows the Company to use the office space without a formal sublease or rental agreement. 
   
 The Company previously accrued $15,000 per month for a general operating fee, which covered the use of office space, certain equipment, and various other services. However, due to the Company having limited available resources, THN has agreed to lease the Company office space at no charge. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company owes THN an amount of $365,462 and $365,462 respectively, for amounts due under this agreement. 
   
  Consulting Agreements  
   
 The Company has entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Howell, President of the Company, whereby the Company agreed to pay Mr. Howell $10,000 per month for consulting services through December 31, 2010.  Mr. Howell received 714,286 shares of common stock valued at $120,000 as a partial payment for amounts owed under this agreement in January of 2010 and during 2009.  The consulting agreement may be terminated at will by the Company. The Company intends to   continue to   engage Mr. Howell as a consultant until his consulting services are no longer required. Mr. Howell received 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $40,000 in February of 2011 as partial payment for amounts due under this agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company owes Mr. Howell $770,000 and $680,000, respectively under the agreement. 

Page 8 
   
 The Company has entered into a consulting agreement with Eric Clemons, a shareholder of the Company, whereby the Company agreed to pay Mr. Clemons $10,000 per month for consulting services through December 2009. This employment agreement carried the provision that it could be extended beyond this date upon mutual agreement by both parties and that the agreement could be canceled by the Company at any time after that date.  Mr. Clemons received 1,471,419 shares of common stock valued at $103,000 as a partial payment for amounts owed under this agreement in January of 2010.  The Company continued to accrue amounts owed under this agreement through July of 2010.  The balance owed to Mr. Clemons at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is $70,000 and $70,000, respectively under this agreement.  The Company disputes this amount and is currently assessing legal issues surrounding this obligation. 
   
  NOTE 6     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no additional items to disclose.

  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.  As used in this report, the terms  Company ,  we ,  our ,  us  and  HSTC  refer to HST Global, Inc. 
   
   Preliminary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
   
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which we indicate by words or phrases such as  anticipate,   expect,   intend,   plan,   will,   we believe,   HSTC believes,   management believes  and similar language. The forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of HSTC and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in the discussion under  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this report. The actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We base the forward-looking statements on information currently available to us, and we assume no obligation to update them.  Investors are also advised to refer to the information in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. As such, investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions. 
   
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
   
 Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. 
   
   Results of Operations     The Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
   
 The Company had revenues of $0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The costs of sales for the same period were $0 in 2016 as compared to $0 for 2015.  The Company incurred expenses of $33,545 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $32,486 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  This represents a $1,059 or 3.26% increase in the net loss for the 3rd quarter of 2016, which is attributable to a slight increase in general and administrative expenses.  The expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were incurred to further the company   s Research and Development efforts and continue the company   s strategic plan of opening wellness clinics worldwide. Until the Company obtains capital required to develop any properties or businesses and obtains the revenues needed from its future operations to meet its obligations, the Company will be dependent upon sources other than operating revenues to meet its operating and capital needs. Operating revenues may never satisfy these needs. 
   
   Results of Operations     The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
   
 The Company had revenues of $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The costs of sales for the same period were $0 in 2016 as compared to $0 for 2015.  The Company incurred expenses of $102,716 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to  

Page 10 
   
 $121,128 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This represents a $18,412 or 15.20%decrease in the net loss for the first nine months of 2016, which is attributable to significant reduction in activity after the first quarter of 2015.  The expenses in the nine months of 2016 were incurred to further the company   s Research and Development efforts and continue the company   s strategic plan of opening wellness clinics worldwide.  Until the Company obtains capital required to develop any properties or businesses and obtains the revenues needed from its future operations to meet its obligations, the Company will be dependent upon sources other than operating revenues to meet its operating and capital needs.  Operating revenues may never satisfy these needs. 
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 Our cash balance as of September 30, 2016 was $428.   
   
 The Company does not currently have sufficient capital in its accounts, nor sufficient firm commitments for capital to assure its ability to meet its current obligations or to continue its planned operations. The Company is continuing to pursue working capital and additional revenue through the seeking of the capital it needs to carry on its planned operations. There is no assurance that any of the planned activities will be successful. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 None. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  
   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer (the  Certifying Officer ) maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management timely. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, the Certifying Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule [13a-14(c)/15d-14(c)] under the Exchange Act) within 45 days prior to the filing date of this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Certifying Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting them to material information relative to our company required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC. 
   
   Changes in Internal Controls   
   
 During the Quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes made to our internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to affect the reliability of those controls, or the accuracy of our financial reporting.

 (b)  
 designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
