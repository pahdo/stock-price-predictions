1.  Organization and Significant Accounting Policies  

Description
of Business   

SurePure Investment Holding AG ( SPI )
was incorporated in Switzerland in 2007. From 2007 to December 12, 2012 SPI was the holding company of the SurePure Group (the
 Group ), which included subsidiaries and other entities whose activities primarily benefit the Group. On December
12, 2012, SPI entered into an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement with SurePure, Inc. ( SurePure US  or
the  Company ) pursuant to which SurePure US acquired SPI in a share exchange (the  Share Exchange ) and
became the holding company for the Group, including SPI. Although SurePure US is the legal acquirer of SPI, SPI is treated as
the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes and under this method, SurePure US retains SPI s financial
reporting history. 

Under the Share Exchange, each share of
the capital stock of SPI was exchanged for one share of SurePure US common stock, par value $.001 per share ( Common Stock ),
and, in the case of one shareholder of SPI, one share of Nonvoting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the
 Nonvoting Convertible Preferred Stock ). 

The Group has developed technology for
using shortwave ultraviolet light ( UV-C ) to purify turbid liquids such as wine, fruit juice and milk. Although initially
designed to treat food-grade applications, it has successfully been applied to liquids such as dairy products for animal consumption,
protein products, bovine blood plasma, water, brines and sugar syrup solutions. The Group holds a patent in 68 countries for this
technology. The Group has been engaged in raising capital, continuing research and development of its technologies and developing
markets for its products. 

Basis of Presentation  

Our accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S.
GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Our
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results
of operations and financial position for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. Amounts in our unaudited consolidated financial statements are, except as otherwise noted, expressed in U.S. Dollars. 

SurePure, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other interim
period or for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Basis of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries are as follows: 

SurePure Investment Holding AG ( SPI ), which wholly-owns SPO; 

SurePure Operations AG ( SPO ), which markets the products of the Group and earns its revenue by selling or
otherwise distributing equipment utilizing the Group s technology globally. SPO owns a patent for the Group s technology
in various countries; 

SurePure Participations AG ( SPP ), is a minority stockholder of SPI and is part of the common holding structure
of the Group. SPP has no operations. SPP became a subsidiary as a result of the Share Exchange on December 12, 2012; 

SurePure Holdings South Africa (Pty) Ltd., which holds the South African patent, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, SurePure
Marketing South Africa (Pty) Ltd. ( SPMSA ), which sells or otherwise distributes equipment utilizing the Group s
technology in South Africa. These entities became subsidiaries as a result of their acquisition on June 12, 2013; and 

SurePure Latin America Maqinas de Purificasao UVC Ltda. ( SPLAM ), which conducts no operations currently and
is in the final stages of deregistration. 

The Group s reporting
currency is the United States Dollar ( USD ) and these consolidated financial statements are presented in USD or  $.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Adoption
of New Accounting Standards   

The
Company has, effective January 1, 2015, early adopted ASU 2014-10 Development Stage Entities which eliminates the requirement
to provided Development Stage Entity reporting. As such, the financial statements as presented no longer contain information that
aggregates all activities from the date of inception through the reporting date. The adoption of this new standard did not have
a material impact on our financial position or results or operations.  

Use
of Estimates    

GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Income
Taxes   

The Group accounts for income taxes using
the liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances
are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not provide a future tax benefit. 

GAAP requires that, in applying the liability
method, the consolidated financial statement effects of an uncertain tax position be recognized based on the outcome that is more
likely than not to occur. Under this criterion, the most likely resolution of an uncertain tax position should be analyzed based
on technical merits and one that will likely be sustained under examination. There are no uncertain tax positions requiring adjustment
to or disclosure in these consolidated financial statements. 

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts receivable represent amounts
due from customers and are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables. The Group establishes
a provision for estimated doubtful accounts, if necessary. 

Property,
Equipment and Related Depreciation    

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost, less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the price paid to acquire the asset and any expenditures that substantially
increase the asset s value or extend the useful life of an existing asset. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend
original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Expenditures for routine
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations. 

SurePure, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Depreciation is provided over the following
estimated useful lives: 

Plant machinery  
      3 to 5 years   
 
      Furniture and fixtures  
      3 to 5 years   
 
      Motor vehicles  
      5 years   
 
      Office and computer equipment  
      3 to 5 years   

Intangible
Assets   

Intangible assets consist of patents in
various countries around the world for the Company s UV-C purification technology. The patents were initially recognized
at their cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of twelve years beginning with
the acquisition of the patents in 2008. The patents expire in October 2020. 

The Group evaluates the carrying value
of its intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances are identified by management
that indicate that such carrying values may not be fully recoverable. The evaluation involves estimating the future undiscounted
cash flows expected to be derived from the assets to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists. As a result of its evaluations,
management determined that it was not necessary to recognize a loss on impairment of its intangible assets for either of the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Revenue   

Revenue is earned from sales or use of
equipment that uses the Company s patented technology and is recognized, net of returns and discounts, when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are
usually met upon completion of delivery and customer acceptance testing of the product by the customer. 

Major
Customers and Accounts Receivable   

The Company had certain customers whose
revenue individually represented 10% or more of the Company s total revenue, or whose accounts receivable balances individually
represented 10% or more of the Company s total accounts receivable, as follows: 

For the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, 1 customer accounted for 100% of revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 1
customer accounted for 97% of revenue. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2015, 1 customer accounted for 98% of revenue and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 2 customer accounted for 93% of
revenue. 

As of September 30, 2016 1 customer
made up 99% of accounts receivable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Shipping
and Handling Costs   

Shipping and handling costs are expensed
as cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. 

Research
and Development   

Research and development costs are charged
to expense as incurred. 

Equity-Based Compensation  

The Company measures compensation cost
for all stock options granted based on fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the grant date. The fair value of
each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value
of each share is based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. Equity-based
compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each stock option or stock grant
expected to vest with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the Company s historical experience and future
expectations. 

Foreign
Currency Translations   

These consolidated financial statements
are presented in USD, which is the Group s reporting currency. The consolidated financial statements of the Group members
have been translated into USD in accordance with GAAP. All asset and liability accounts on the consolidated balance sheets have
been translated using the spot exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Equity accounts have been translated
at their historical rates when the capital transaction occurred. Income and expenses have been translated at the average exchange
rates for the periods presented. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Group s consolidated financial statements
are included in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income (loss). Actual transaction gains and losses are included
in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. 

The functional currencies of the companies
included in the Group are their respective local currencies. Accordingly, the Group is exposed to transaction gains and losses
that result from changes in various foreign currency exchange rates. 

Applicable functional currencies are: 

SPI, SPO, and SPP  
      Swiss Francs   CHF   
 
      SPLAM  
      Brazilian Real   BRL   
 
      SPHSA and SPMSA

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Earnings
(Loss) per Share    

Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per
share are computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue shares of Common Stock, such as options, convertible notes and convertible preferred stock, were exercised or converted
into shares of Common Stock or could otherwise cause the issuance of shares of Common Stock that then would share in earnings
(losses). Such potential issuances of additional shares of Common Stock are included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share. Except as disclosed in Notes 5, 6 and 9 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no securities
or other contracts to issue shares of Common Stock that could cause any dilution of earnings. In addition, when there is a loss,
diluted loss per share is not computed because any potential additional common shares of Common Stock would reduce the reported
loss per share and therefore have an anti-dilutive effect. 

2. 
  Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment consists of the
following: 

Property and equipment is fully depreciated,
and there was no depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

  Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets consist of the following: 

Amortization expense was $4,168 and $4,167
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively and $12,502 and $12,501 for the nine months ended September
30 2016 and 2015 respectively.

5.  Other Loans Payable  

On April 4, 2013, SPMSA borrowed ZAR 2
million (approximately $201,000) from a lender pursuant to a note. The terms of the loan provide for interest of 2% per month
on the outstanding balance which is payable together with the principal balance no later than December 31, 2013. An officer and
stockholder of the Company deposited 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock with the lender as security for the repayment of the loan
to SPMSA. On June 10, 2015, the repayment date was further extended to September 30, 2015. Interest on this loan was approximately
$16,500 and $15,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and approximately $38,000 and $44,200 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014. As of August 10, 2015, the loan was settled with the issuance of 1,676,000 shares of
Common Stock. The Company recognized a gain of $28,951 representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration

On February 11, 2016 the Company entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability company
( SBI ). Under the Purchase Agreement, SBI purchased the Company s promissory note (the  SBI Note )
in the principal amount of $330,000 for a purchase price of $300,000. The SBI Note bears interest at the rate of 0% per annum until
the occurrence of an Event of Default, at which time the SBI Note bears default interest at the rate of 22% per annum. SBI has
the right to convert the SBI Note into shares of the Company s Common Stock following the occurrence of an event of default
under the SBI Note, including the failure to repay the note on or before its maturity date. On August 1, 2016 the Company and SBI
agreed to extend the maturity date of the SBI Note from August 9, 2016 to October 11, 2016. On November 17, 2016 the Company and
SBI agreed to extend the maturity date of the SBI Note from October 11, 2016 to January 11, 2017. As part of the agreement on November
17, 2016 to extend the maturity of the SBI Note until January 11, 2017, SBI and the Company agreed that (i) the number of shares
of the Company s Common Stock into which SBI could convert the SBI Note following the occurrence of an event of default under
the SBI Note, including the failure to repay the SBI Note on or before January 11, 2017 would be based on a conversion price that
is 52.5% of the market price of the Company s shares, rather than 55%; and (ii) the principal amount to be paid to SBI to
discharge the SBI Note in full is $390,000 if the Company repays the SBI Note prior to or on January 11, 2017. In connection with
Amendment No. 2, the Company entered into a fee letter agreement with SBI under which the Company agreed to pay SBI a structuring
fee on November 17, 2016 in the amount of $90,000 with 1,058,824 shares of its Common Stock and a loan monitoring fee of $45,000
which is due on the maturity of the SBI Note.

for future issuance. The Plan authorizes the granting of non-qualified stock options to the Company s directors and to any
independent consultants. The Plan is administered by the Company s board of directors, and may also be administered by a
committee appointed by the board of directors (the  Committee ). The Committee may determine persons eligible for
grants and the timing, type, amount, fair market value and other provisions of such grants. The Committee will have authority,
subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to construe the Plan and the option agreements granted pursuant to the Plan, to
prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the judgment
of the Committee necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any
omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any option agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient
to promote the best interests of the Company. The Plan terminates on December 9, 2022. 

The Plan provides that the determination
of the option price per share for any option rests in discretion of the Committee. Options granted under the Plan must be granted
within ten years from the date on which the Plan has been adopted. No options granted under the Plan may be exercisable after
ten years from the date of grant. The Company s board of directors may suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part
or amend the Plan in such respects as the board may deem appropriate and in the best interest of the company. No amendment, suspension
or termination of the Plan shall, however, without the optionee's consent, alter or impair any of the rights or obligations granted
under the Plan. 

On November 12, 2013, the Company granted
non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 475,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock under the plan, each
at an exercise price of $0.89 per share. The options now are fully vested.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing stock options
include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent historical period beginning December 12, 2012); the expected
option life; the expected dividend yield; and the risk-free rate (an estimate based upon the yields of Treasury constant maturities)
equal to the expected life of the option. The fair values for the options, all of which were granted in 2013, were determined
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions: 

There was no reduction for estimated forfeitures.
Under this model and the foregoing assumptions, the options granted in 2013 were valued at $151,053. Of this amount, $87,452,
$15,900 and $47,701 is attributable to executives, employees and consultants, respectively. Equity-based compensation for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0, $12,691, $0 and $37,522, respectively. These amounts are included
in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Payroll Tax Obligations  

During 2013, SPMSA received notification
from the South African Revenue Service ( SARS ) regarding unpaid payroll taxes of approximately $185,000.  SPMSA
requested additional time to arrange a payment plan that is suitable to both parties and commenced making monthly payments to
SARS. Due to insufficient funds the SPMSA has been unable to continue making additional payments in this regard and has requested
additional time to arrange a payment plan that is suitable to both parties. As at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
unpaid balance of this liability was approximately $104,000 and $93,000, respectively and is included in accounts payable and other
current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective October 31, 2014, SARS placed a collection order
on the bank account of SPMSA for the outstanding amounts due. 

Additionally, the Company has payroll
tax and social security obligations in Switzerland relating to the employment of the chief financial officer by SPOAG. As at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the unpaid balance of this liability was approximately $210,000 and $169,000, respectively and
is included in accounts payable and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Employment
and Consulting Agreements   

The Company has entered into agreements
to secure the services of two executives.  These agreements provide for annual compensation and require a minimum termination
notice period by the employer of three months.  Both executives are stockholders of the Company. The minimum amount due under
these agreements is approximately $138,400 over the year ending December 31, 2016 

The total compensation to these executives
was approximately $147,000 and $153,000 for the three ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and approximately $432,000 and $452,000
for the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company has entered into agreements
with unrelated third party consultants and institutions for consulting, research and professional services.  These agreements
can be terminated by either party with between one and three months written notice or immediately if for cause.  The amounts
due vary according to the nature of the service arrangement and the length of notice required for termination. The minimum amount
due under these agreements is approximately $63,000 over the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Other Commitments   

The Company is obligated to make payments
of approximately $25,500 subsequent to September 30, 2016 in connection with purchase orders open as of September 30, 2016 for
the purchase of parts to be delivered in 2016. Payments to vendors relating to these purchases are scheduled to be made prior

The Company
has evaluated its subsequent events since September 30, 2016.  The Company has determined that, other than as noted under
Note 5, there were no material subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in these unaudited
consolidated financial statements.  

12.  Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. 

The Company
has generated recurring losses and expects to incur additional losses as it expands its photopurification technology and develops
marketing, sales and financial plans. As reflected in the accompanying  unaudited c onsolidated
financial statements, the Company s total consolidated liabilities exceed total consolidated assets at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 by $1,809,647 and $1,426,874, respectively.   

To date, the Company s cash flow
has been funded with cash investments by its shareholders, certain third parties and to a considerably lesser extent, revenue.
These inflows have been insufficient to enable the company to cover its costs. Additionally, as disclosed in Note 8, with respect
to payroll tax obligations due in both Switzerland and South Africa and tax penalties due the IRS, the Company has been unable
to meet its obligations for payment of its taxes and the filing of tax returns. 

The Company requires additional capital
to continue its development and to achieve sufficient revenues to support its operations. The extent of the Company s future
working capital requirements depend on many factors, including its ability to maintain revenues and to manage expenses. The Company
requires additional financing either through borrowings or the sale of equity to support its operations. 

The Company s access to additional
financing, if any, will depend on a variety of factors over which the Company has little or no control. These factors include
market conditions, the general unavailability of equity financing to the Company in light of its limited revenues, the actual
financial and operational results of the Company on a consolidated basis, as well as investors  perception of the Company s
short-term and long-term financial prospects. If future financing is not available on acceptable terms, or on any other terms,
the Company will not be able to continue as a going concern.

in discussions with current and other potential investors, and the Company is also considering additional offerings of Common
Stock. The Company was not, however, able to secure significant additional equity financing during the nine months to September,
2016 from existing shareholders or otherwise, despite its efforts to do so. In addition, although the Company has projected that
increase in the commercialization of its technology may provide additional cash flow for operations, it has not generated any
new equipment sales orders in the past nine months. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Forward Looking Statements  

This  Management s Discussion

 forward-looking statements  that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize
or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  The

Overview  

The results presented in this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations  are those of SurePure, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(all of which are collectively referred to in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations as  we ) as reflected in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with such consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto. The results presented below pertain to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Insufficient Funding  

For the period from our inception on August
24, 2005 to September 30, 2016, we had net losses of approximately $35,879,000. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we
continued to experience a significant shortfall in funding from operations and investors. As a result, we require significant
additional funding to maintain our operations and execute our business plan. If we are unable to obtain financing from our current
shareholders or other sources, we will be unable to meet our business objectives and may scale back or even discontinue our operations
until such time, if ever, that we are able to obtain financing. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain financing, there is no assurance
that any financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources.

biochemically or organoleptically. 

Although UV light has long been used as
a surface sterilizer and has been applied to clear water successfully, this is the first technology of its kind that can process
opaque or turbid liquids. Its scope of application is therefore virtually unlimited. Food-grade liquid application in beverages
abound; technical application to process water and liquid raw materials, as well as liquids such as diesel are possible. We continue
to do research work either by ourselves or in conjunction with clients to establish the efficacy on other liquids including various
consumer beverages and home care products. 

The heart of the SurePure photopurification
technology is the Turbulator technology for which SurePure holds one United States and 16 foreign patents. The unique and self-cleaning
design of the Turbulator enables the purification of turbid liquids on an industrial processing scale. 

We have experienced negative cash flows
from operations with respect to our business since our inception. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have adequate working capital
resources to satisfy our current liabilities which included penalties owed to the United States and Swiss tax authorities, and,
as a result, we have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projections, we
are not assured that we will have the cash resources to enable us to continue to fund normal operations. 

Plan of Operation  

We seek to expand the commercial acceptance
of our SurePure Turbulator purification systems. To pursue this goal, contingent on our obtaining sufficient capital to maintain
our operations, we plan to execute the following steps: 

Relying
                                         on the regulatory approval that was granted in January 2016 by the European Food Standards
                                         Agency for dairy milk treated with our Technology to extend its shelflife and increase
                                         its vitamin D content, to generate additional customer interest and transactions in the
                                         EU and elsewhere for dairy applications;    

Attend
                                         and promote our product at international trade shows in 2016 for the brewing, dairy industries,
                                         liquid egg and industrial applications. At these venues we will seek to establish contact
                                         with industry participants, including distributors of engineered systems, and to make
                                         them aware of our product s advantages and the expanded applications of the product
                                         that we have developed;    

Continue
                                         to pursue regulatory clearances and approvals for applications, such as dairy, that are
                                         required for our technology to be sold in those industries. In particular, we expect
                                         to take the following actions with regulatory agencies:    

To
                                         request review of the SurePure technology by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )
                                         for a number of applications so that the technology may be categorized as  generally
                                         recognized as safe,  or  GRAS  and     

Seek
                                         to market and sell our product and our technology for industrial applications;    

Seek
                                         to expand the level of commercialization of our technology in the liquid egg, wine, dairy,
                                         fruit juice, carbonated soft drink and other beverage industries;    

Expand
                                         our distribution networks for our products by identifying additional distributors according
                                         to geographic market, expertise with specific liquids and existing client relationships
                                         and negotiating agreements with the identified distributors on terms acceptable to both
                                         the distributors and to us; and    

Obtain
                                         additional equity financing to support our growth from current shareholders, institutional
                                         investors or other investors to provide capital to support and augment our operations.    

Our goal is to grow significantly over
the next five years through the use of working capital and equity financing, if capital and financing are available to us. If
we are able to obtain sufficient financing, we believe that it will be feasible for us to grow our operations based on our strategy
of targeting strategic global regions with multiple potential clients for the commercialization of our technology. However, we
will also seek to carefully monitor the risks associated with achieving our goal to increase commercialization and meet client
expectations while also becoming financially solvent. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we focused
on the following activities: 

continuing
                                         with commercial trials with key customers;    

concluding
                                         agreements with customers;    

working
                                         with regulatory authorities such that our technology can be employed in key areas;    

manufacturing,
                                         delivering and commissioning equipment ordered by customers; and    

attempting
                                         to negotiate financing arrangements.    

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we have focused on the following
activities: 

continuing
                                         with commercial trials with key customers;    

concluding
                                         agreements and accepting orders from new customers;    

pursuing
                                         the expansion of our customer base and distributor network internationally    

working
                                         with regulatory authorities such that our technology can be employed in key areas;    

manufacturing,
                                         delivering and commissioning equipment ordered by customers; and    

negotiating
                                         possible equity financing agreements.    

Results of Operations  

The following table summarizes our results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with our results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

Revenues  

We had revenues of
approximately $3,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 100% decrease as compared to approximately
$893,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease as compared to the 2015 year was primarily due to timing
of a customer installation during the period resulting from a less orders for the period. Revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was approximately $1,298,000, a decrease of 47% compared to the $2,443,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Although we are negotiating
certain agreements for the commercialization of our SurePure technology and although there are ongoing tests of our technology
with potential customers, it is unlikely that more than one or two of those agreements as currently structured will generate significant
amounts of revenue during the next three months. As a general matter, however, we expect that revenues will increase to the extent
that our commercialization efforts are successful. These commercialization efforts seek to introduce our technology to a broader
range of clients and geographic areas. Our business model is largely based on sales of equipment. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

We had general and
administrative expenses of approximately $409,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 4% decrease
as compared with approximately $427,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase as compared to 2015 was
to lower professional fees , as well as reduced travel expenditures due to timing of customer visits. For the nine months ended
September, 2016, general and administrative expenses of approximately $1,363,000 were 7% lower than the comparable expenses of
approximately $1,460,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease as compared to 2015 was also primarily due
to lower professional fees, as well as reduced travel expenditures due to timing of customer visits. 

General and administrative
expenses are largely attributable to employment costs, professional and consulting fees and business travel expenses. 

We expect that our
general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods if we are able to obtain funding for our operations, as the
increased level of commercialization of our technology will require increased levels of staffing and associated expenditures. 

Research and Development Expenses  

We had research and
development expenses of approximately $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 100% decrease as compared
with approximately $11,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $58,000, or 21% higher than the approximately $48,000 of research and development
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase as compared to the first nine months of 2015 was primarily
due to timing of research work related to new client development. 

We expect that our
research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we pursue new applications and clients for our technology. 

Interest Expense  

We had interest expense
of approximately $40,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 344% increase, as compared to approximately
$9,000 of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense was approximately $88,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 80% increase as compared to approximately $49,000 of interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the fact that a new loan was taken out during 2016 which
quantum was higher than the loan on hand during the comparable period in 2015. 

Net Income (Loss)  

For
the reasons discussed above, we had a net loss of approximately $349,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
with a net income of approximately $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   Net
losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $856,000 as compared to net losses of approximately $402,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, or an increase of 113%.  

We have not as yet
generated sufficient revenue to fund our operations for the nine months to date in 2016, and we expect our net losses to continue
until such time as our commercialization efforts for our technology produce an increase in revenues sufficient to meet the cost
of our operations. Accordingly, we expect to continue to operate at a loss at least through calendar 2016. 

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)  

We have realized net
operating losses in Switzerland, South Africa and the United States. In addition to net operating losses in prior periods, our
net operating losses may result in a potential future income tax benefit, to the extent that any unexpired net operating loss
carry-forwards can offset future operating profits. 

Impact of Inflation  

We believe that inflation has not had a
material effect on our operations for the period from August 24, 2005 (when our operations began) to September 30, 2016. 

Capital Expenditures  

We did not invest in property and equipment
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our principal sources of liquidity have
historically been through sales of our Common Stock to our investors. During the nine months ended September30, 2016, however,
we were only able to obtain minimal additional equity funding. We issued 500,000 shares of our Common Stock in regard to an investment
of $100,000 by an investor. Additionally we issued 1,786,008 shares of our Common Stock in settlement of a portion of the liability
(approximately $357,200) to our officers and directors and we issued 930,000 shares of our Common Stock, in settlement of a portion
of the liability (approximately $186,000) to various consultants. 

We continue to discuss potential financing
transactions with various third parties, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to conclude financing transactions
with these or any other investors. 

Our current assets are insufficient to
meet our current obligations or to satisfy our cash needs over the next twelve months and, as such, we require debt or equity
financing. We are pursuing prospective sources for equity financing in an amount that would allow us to meet our commercialization
targets. We face significant obstacles to attracting new financing due to our historical and current record of net losses and
working capital deficits and the low level of the commercialization of our technology. Therefore, despite our efforts, we can
provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain the financing required to meet our stated objectives or even to continue
our business as a going concern. 

The following
table summarizes our financial position at September 30, 2016, compared with our financial position at December 31, 2015 : 

As noted above under  Insufficient
Funding  and as also noted below under this heading, our current cash resources are extremely limited. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of
approximately $1,000 and other current assets of approximately $160,000, consisting of accounts receivable and prepaid expenses,
and total assets of approximately $227,000. As of September 30, 2016, we had current liabilities of approximately $2,037,000,
consisting of accounts payable, accounts payable to related parties, accrued liabilities and loans. Of this amount, approximately
$227,000 represented liabilities that were due to officers and directors, a decrease in liabilities to officers and stockholders
of approximately $87,000 as compared to such amount as of December 31, 2015. This was attributable to the fact that during August
2016 we issued 1,786,008 shares of our Common Stock in settlement of a portion of the liability (approximately $357,200) to our
officers and directors. Additionally we issued 930,000 shares of our Common Stock, in settlement of a portion of the liability
(approximately $186,000) to various consultants. 

Our shareholders  deficit was approximately
$1,810,000 as of September 30, 2016, compared with deficit of approximately $1,427,000 as of December 31, 2015. 

Cash Flow Analysis  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 our cash used in operating activities was approximately $338,000, which amount corresponded mainly to net losses from our
operations, reduction in customer deposits payable, increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase in accounts payable
and prepaid expenses for the period to date. Cash from financing activities was approximately $400,000, $300,000 arising from
a loan note secured during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and $100,000 arising from the issuance of common stock during the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. We expect to continue to have periods of negative cash flows from operating activities until
such time as we fully commercialize our technology. 

We do not expect to pay cash dividends
in the foreseeable future. 

We have a defined stock option plan and
contractual commitments with all of our officers and directors. 

We plan to increase the number of employees
to meet the anticipated demand if we are able to achieve wider acceptance of our technology. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Item 3.    Quantitative
                                         and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4.    Controls
                                         and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and
as a result of the material weaknesses discussed below, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

Our management, including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, and has concluded that there was no change that occurred during the quarterly
period ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Exhibit 31.1  

CERTIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
OFFICER 

PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY
ACT OF 2002 

I, Guy Kebble, certify that: 

1.    I
have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of SurePure, Inc.;  

2.    Based
on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
