1.   
       Organization
    and Nature of Operations     

Organization
-   SQN Alternative Investment Fund III L.P. (the  Partnership ) was formed on March 10, 2010, as a Delaware
limited partnership and is engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and investment in leased equipment, which includes:
(i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring
equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration.
The Partnership will terminate no later than December 31, 2034.  

Nature
of Operations     The principal investment strategy of the Partnership is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-savings) equipment or other physical assets with high in-place value and long, relative to the investment term, economic
life and project financings. The Partnership executes its investment strategy by making investments in equipment already subject
to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party
end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset and project financings; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv)
acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to time, the Partnership
may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to its leasing customers. The Partnership may use other investment structures
that SQN Capital Management, LLC (the  Investment Manager ) believes will provide the Partnership with an appropriate
level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize its return on its investment while protecting against downside
risk. In many cases, the structure will include the Partnership holding title to or a priority or controlling position in the
equipment or other asset.  

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF III GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership s Investment Manager. Both the Partnership s General Partner and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited
liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls the day to day activities and operations of the Partnership, pursuant
to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital contribution of $100 for a 1% interest
in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and manages
the investment portfolio of the Partnership. The General Partner or its affiliates purchased 100 limited partnership interests
( Units ) for $100,000 on March 15, 2013.  

On
October 9, 2013, the Partnership formed a special purpose entity, SQN Delta, LLC ( Delta ), a limited liability company
registered in the state of Delaware which is 100% owned by the Partnership. The purpose of Delta was to acquire an $8,540,000
interest in two newly commissioned shipping vessels under long-term charter contracts. The Partnership consolidates Delta into
the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

On
June 22, 2016, Delta entered into a sale and assignment of partnership interest agreement with the Partnership and a third party.
Under the terms of the agreement, Delta acquired an 88.20% (90% of 98%) economic interest in a portfolio of a container feeder
vessel, for an aggregate investment of $4,252,500. Delta contributed cash of $850,500 and entered into a loan payable with a third
party of $3,443,185. Delta acquired their economic interest in the vessel through a limited partnership interest in Boxship Holding
GmbH   Co. KG, a Germany based limited partnership ( Boxship Holding ), which acquired and operates the container
feeder vessel. Delta bears the risks and rewards of ownership of Boxship Holding and therefore Delta consolidates the financial
statements of Boxship Holding. Since the Partnership bears the primary risks and rewards of Delta, the Partnership consolidates
Delta into the condensed consolidated financial statements. A third party contributed $462,740 to purchase a 10% share of Boxship
Holding which is presented as non-controlling interest on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

On
June 19, 2013, the Partnership acquired the primary economic risks and rewards in a newly formed special purpose entity, SQN Bravo
LLC ( Bravo ). The Partnership s Investment Manager evaluated this acquisition based on the following factors:
(i) the Partnership was able to leverage its investments through debt at rates less than the corresponding leased equipment are
earning and (ii) the Partnership was able to use the proceeds to make additional lease investments at higher rates. The Partnership
consolidates Bravo into the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

The
Partnership will make, at the sole discretion of the Investment Manager, semi-annual cash distributions to each Limited Partner
computed at 3% (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner) of each Limited Partner s capital contribution,
beginning six months after the Partnership s initial closing which occurred on May 2, 2011. The Partnership s income,
losses and distributions are allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until the Limited Partners have
received total distributions equal to each Limited Partner s capital contribution plus an 8%, compounded annually, cumulative
return on each Limited Partners  capital contribution. After such time, income, losses and distributions will be allocated
80% to the Limited Partners and 20% to the General Partner.  

The
Partnership was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 17, 2011, which was
the commencement date of the Offering Period. The Offering Period concluded on March 15, 2013. During the Offering Period, the
Partnership admitted 375 Limited Partners, raised $27,861,100 in capital contributions, issued 27,861.10 Units at $1,000 per Unit
and paid organizational and offering expenses totaling $999,119. During the Offering Period the Partnership paid $557,222 in distribution
expenses to SQN Securities LLC, ( Securities ) a majority-owned subsidiary of the Investment Manager. Securities was
the sole selling agent for the Partnership s Units. A Limited Partner may not redeem their Units in the Partnership without
the prior written consent of the General Partner. The General Partner has the sole discretion to approve or deny any redemption
requested by a Limited Partner.  

Due
to the Partnership not achieving certain equity raising milestones during the Offering Period the Partnership s General
Partner and/or its Investment Manager were required to reimburse a portion of the organizational and offering expenses incurred
by the Partnership and reduce the management fee paid to the Investment Manager to such an amount over the Partnership s
entire life that the total average management fee will not be greater than 2% per year of the aggregate offering proceeds (See
note 3).  

2.   
       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation     The condensed consolidated financial statements of SQN Alternative Investment Fund III, L.P. and
Subsidiaries at September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated
financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
interim periods presented. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not necessarily be
taken as indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Partnership s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation -   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and its subsidiaries
where the Partnership has the primary economic benefits of ownership. The Partnership s consolidation policy requires the
consolidation of entities where a controlling financial interest is held as well as the consolidation of variable interest entities
in which the Partnership has the primary economic benefits. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated
in consolidation.  

Use
of estimates     The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
the General Partner and Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination
of allowances for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, estimated useful
lives, and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents     The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds maintained in checking and money market
accounts held at financial institutions. The Partnership s cash and cash equivalents are held principally at one financial
institution in the United States of America and at times the balances may exceed federally insured limits.  

The
Partnership has placed these funds in an international financial institution in order to minimize risk relating to exceeding insured
limits. The Partnership, through Summit Asset Management Limited, maintains an unrestricted bank account at a major financial
institution in the United Kingdom for purposes of receiving payments and funding transactions in Pound Sterling. At September
30, 2016, the Partnership did not have any cash and cash equivalents held in a bank in the United Kingdom. At December 31, 2015,
the Partnership had  45,405 ($67,209 applying exchange rates at December 31, 2015), respectively, of cash and cash equivalents
held in two banks in the United Kingdom.  

Credit
Risk     In the normal course of business, the Partnership is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that
the Partnerships  counterparty to an agreement will at some point either have an inability or unwillingness to make contractually
required payments. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to lessees are dispersed across different industry segments throughout
the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Although the Partnership does not currently foresee a concentrated credit
risk associated with these lessees, lease payments are dependent upon the financial stability of the industry segments in which
they operate.  

Asset
Impairments     Assets in the Partnership s investment portfolio, which are considered long lived assets, are
periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If there is an indication of
impairment, the Partnership estimates the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash in-flows expected to be generated by an asset
less the future out-flows expected to be necessary to obtain those in-flows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment
loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the
statement of operations in the period the determination is made. The events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate
that an asset may be impaired are, (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value, (ii)
the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and (iii) it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition
of the asset will be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires
the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents or receipts from the sale of the residual value investment,
estimated downtime between re-leasing events, and the amount of re-leasing costs. The Investment Manager s review for impairment
includes a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators, including third party appraisals, published values for similar
assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types, and the occurrence
of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.  

Lease
Classification and Revenue Recognition     The Partnership records revenue based upon the lease classification determined
at the inception of the transaction and based upon the terms of the lease or when there are significant changes to the lease terms.  

The
Partnership leases equipment to third parties and each such lease may be classified as either a finance lease or an operating
lease. Initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease for a finance lease. For an operating
lease, initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated.  

For
finance leases, the Partnership records at lease inception the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated
unguaranteed residual value of the equipment upon lease termination, the initial direct costs, if any, related to the lease and
the related unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable
plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance
income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.  

For
operating leases, rental income is recognized on the straight line basis over the lease term. Billed and uncollected operating
lease receivables will be included in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value.
Rental income received in advance is the difference between the timing of the cash payments and the income recognized on the straight
line basis.  

For
leases subject to equipment notes receivable, specific payment terms were reached requiring payments which resulted in the recognition
of interest income. This income is recognized over the course of the lease agreement.  

The
Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease, financing transaction, and lease acquisition.
As part of this process it determines the unguaranteed residual value, if any, to be used once the acquisition has been approved.
The factors considered in determining the unguaranteed residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of
the potential lessee, the type of equipment being considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee s
business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed
for impairment in accordance with the Partnership s policy relating to impairment review.  

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset will be utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a
significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is
calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers
and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.  

Finance
Lease Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Lease, Notes and Loan Accounts     In the normal course of business,
the Partnership provides credit or financing to its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers, and maintains reserves
for potential credit losses. These credit or financing transactions are normally collateralized by the equipment being financed.
In determining the amount of allowance for doubtful lease, note and loan accounts, the Investment Manager considers historical
credit losses, the past due status of receivables, payment history, and other customer-specific information, including the value
of the collateral. The past due status of a receivable is based on its contractual terms. Expected credit losses are recorded
as an allowance for doubtful lease, note and loan accounts. Receivables are written off when the Investment Manager determines
they are uncollectible. At September 30, 2016, an allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts is not currently provided
since, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, all accounts recorded are deemed collectible.  

Equipment
Notes Receivable     Equipment notes receivable are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements as
the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized deferred fees, premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Costs to originate
loans, if any, are reported as other assets in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Income is recognized over the
life of the note agreement. On certain equipment notes receivable, specific payment terms were reached requiring prepayments which
resulted in the recognition of unearned interest income. Unearned income, discounts and premiums, if any, are amortized to interest
income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest rate method. Equipment notes receivable
are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, the Investment Manager
periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon the Investment
Manager s judgment, accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status. Accounts on a non-accrual status are only returned to
an accrual status when the account has been brought current and the Partnership believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable
is probable. Revenue on non-accrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received.  

Initial
Direct Costs     The Partnership capitalizes initial direct costs associated with the origination and funding of lease
assets. These costs are amortized on a lease by lease basis over the actual contract term of each lease using the effective interest
rate method for finance leases and the straight-line method for operating leases. Upon disposal of the underlying lease assets,
both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved. Costs related to leases that are not consummated
are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense.  

Cost
Method     The Partnership records its investment in participation interests at cost. Under the cost method of accounting
for investments, dividends are the basis for recognition by an investor of earnings from an investment. The Partnership recognizes
as income dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition.
The net accumulated earnings of the investee subsequent to the date of investment are recognized by the Partnership only to the
extent distributed by the investee as dividends. Dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment
are considered a return of investment and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment.  

Income
Taxes     As a partnership, no provision for income taxes is recorded since the liability for such taxes is that of
each of the Partners rather than the Partnership. The Partnership s income tax returns are subject to examination by the
federal and state taxing authorities, and changes, if any, could adjust the individual income tax of the Partners.  

Per
Share Data     Net income or loss attributable to Limited Partners per weighted average number of limited partnership
interests outstanding is calculated as follows; the net income or loss allocable to the Limited Partners divided by the weighted
average number of limited partnership interests outstanding during the period.  

Foreign
Currency Transactions     The Partnership has designated the United States of America dollar as the functional currency
for the Partnership s investments denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, certain assets and liabilities are translated
at either the reporting period exchange rates or the historical exchange rates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average
rate of exchange for the period, and all transaction gains or losses are reflected in the period s results of operations.  

Depreciation
    The Partnership records depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease.
In order to calculate depreciation, the Partnership first determines the depreciable equipment cost, which is the cost less the
estimated residual value. The estimated residual value is the estimate of the value of the equipment at lease termination. Depreciation
expense is recorded by applying the straight-line method of depreciation to the depreciable equipment cost over the lease term
which varies from one to five years.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to Leases Analysis),
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.
The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases
on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use
certain transition relief. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

In
February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis), effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is
intended to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations, and securitization structures. The amendments in the ASU affect the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations.
In addition, the amendments in this ASU simplify and improve current U.S. GAAP by reducing the number of consolidation models.
The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

4.   
       SQN
    Bravo LLC    

On
June 19, 2013, the Partnership sold certain assets along with their related rental streams to a newly formed special purpose entity,
SQN Bravo LLC. On the same date, the Partnership made an equity investment in Bravo. The Partnership s Investment Manager
determined that this was in the Partnership s best interests due to the following factors: (i) the Partnership was able
to leverage investments through debt at rates less than the corresponding leased equipment were earning and (ii) the Partnership
was able to use the proceeds to make additional lease investments at higher rates of return.  

On
June 19, 2013, Bravo obtained financing as follows; (i) a non-recourse loan payable for $5,860,085 and (ii) an equity investment
from the Partnership of $3,906,724. SQN Alternative Investment Fund II, LLC (  SQN Fund II ), a private equipment
leasing fund managed by the Partnership s Investment Manager also sold a seasoned portfolio of leased equipment to Bravo.
The portfolio purchased from SQN Fund II was valued at the time of purchase based on discounted cash flows for the revenue streams
at a predetermined rate and the residual values of the underlying assets were supported by third party appraisers. Bravo purchased
the following general types of leased assets: (i) $632,284 in finance leases (See Note 5), (ii) $1,937,636 in equipment subject
to operating leases (See Note 6) and (iii) $2,500,000 in residual value investments in equipment on lease. In addition, the Partnership
sold various leased assets with a net book value of $4,137,073 to Bravo. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Partnership
increased its equity investment in Bravo to a total of $7,509,808, comprised of $3,217,293 for equipment lease transactions and
$470,000 for equipment notes receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership received approximately $5,166,320
in cash from Bravo. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership received approximately $783,624 in cash from
Bravo. As of the September 30, 2016, the total investment in Bravo was $1,559,864.  

As
a result of the equity purchase noted above, on June 19, 2013, the Partnership acquired the primary economic risks and rewards
in Bravo and accordingly, the Partnership consolidates Bravo into its financial statements and results of operations.  

5.   
       Investments
    in Finance Leases    

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net investments in finance leases consisted of the following:  

Anaerobic
Digestion Plant   

An
anaerobic digestion plant is a series of processes in which microorganisms breakdown biodegradable materials and produce a biogas
which can be used to generate electricity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Bravo sold this finance lease to a
third party. The third party paid cash proceeds of  109,000 ($150,660 applying exchange rate of 1.3822 at February 29, 2016),
which is net of a value added tax of  21,800, ($30,132 applying exchange rate of 1.3822 at February 29, 2016). The Partnership
reclassified $227,824 to accounts receivable for expected VAT refunds. The net book value of this finance lease at the time of
sale was $580,648, which resulted in the Partnership recognizing a U.S. GAAP loss of $202,164.  

Bottle
Recycling and Extrusion Production Line   

On
June 29, 2011, the Partnership entered into a Participation Agreement (the  Agreement ) for an ownership interest
in a Hire Purchase Agreement (the  HP Agreement ). The HP Agreement is between an independent United Kingdom leasing
entity and the lessee of a bottle recycling and extrusion line located in the United Kingdom. The Partnership made it s
initial payment under the Agreement on June 29, 2011 totaling  1,100,000 and made it s final payment on October 13,
2011 totaling  730,000.  

Under
the terms of the HP Agreement there is both an initial rental period and a fixed rental period. The initial rental period ran
through June 30, 2012 at which time the fixed rental period began. The fixed rental period is for a term of 60 months and the
Partnership receives monthly payments of  41,021. At lease termination the lessee has an option to purchase the leased equipment
at a fixed price. The Partnership s portion of the proceeds will be  253,821. The Partnership paid initial direct
costs as follows: (i) on November 30, 2011, the Partnership paid  9,125 and (ii) on July 15, 2011, the Partnership paid
 45,775 related to the acquisition of this leased equipment. As result of the dramatic decline in oil prices, a key component
in the production of plastics, the lessee has suffered a significant downturn in its business and profitability as the price of
recycled plastics no longer presented an attractive alternative to new plastic products. During the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Investment Manager determined that collecting the total outstanding balance of this finance lease is unlikely and has therefore
written down the value of this finance lease by  817,348 ($1,209,838 using exchange rate of 1.4802 on December 31, 2015).
At September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to this lease.  

At
September 30, 2016, the aggregate amounts of future minimum lease payments receivable are as follows:  

(1)
Converted to U.S. Dollars at September 30, 2016 exchange rate of 1.2969.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership incurred a foreign currency transaction loss of $27,272 and
$132,555, respectively, on its various investments in finance leases. All amounts are included in foreign currency transaction
losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership incurred a foreign currency transaction loss of $144,511 on
its various investments in finance leases and a gain of $21,852, respectively. All amounts are included in foreign currency transaction
losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

       Investment
    in Equipment Subject to Operating Leases    

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, investments in equipment subject to operating leases consisted of the following:

$491,302 and $550,413 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Modular
Accommodations   

In
January 2015, Bravo reclassified three leases from other assets to operating leases upon the final execution of lease renewals
and the receipt of lease payments associated with such renewals. These leases are for modular accommodations configured as healthcare
centers in the United Kingdom that Bravo purchased for  1,582,278 ($2,500,000 applying the exchange rate used in the agreement).
One of the leases has a month to month lease term and monthly payments of  17,295. The second lease had a remaining term
of 60 months and monthly payments of  6,760. The third lease also had a remaining term of 60 months and monthly payments
of  12,917. These leases generated approximately $145,000 and $461,000 of rental income for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively. At September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to these leases.  

Aircraft
Rotables   

On
June 19, 2013, Bravo purchased a lease for a 90% ownership interest in aircraft rotables located in Australia from SQN Fund II
for $310,000, which included the assumption by Bravo of a security deposit of $29,700. The lease expired on February 15, 2015
and required monthly rental payments of $3,777. At lease expiration, the lessee extended the lease on the same terms for another
four years through February 15, 2019. The lease generated approximately $11,200 and $33,800 in rental income for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. At September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to this lease.  

As
part of this transaction Bravo became a party to a participation agreement and a service agreement with a third party (the  Participant ).
Under the participation agreement, the Participant acquired a 10% ownership interest by providing 10% of the financing for this
transaction. Under the service agreement, the Participant will receive 5% of the gross payments from the lessee. The Participant
will provide program management services and inventory tracking and monitoring services for all of the aircraft rotable parts.
Bravo is required to remit the Participant s portion of both the participation agreement and service agreement from the
gross payments from the lessee within 10 days of receipt from the lessee.

Promissory Note was collateralized by the shares of the borrower and by an investment portfolio consisting of among other assets,
equipment leases, direct hard assets and infrastructure investments. In March 2016, the Partnership received cash of $41,572 ($8,572
of principal and $33,000 of interest). In June 2016, the Partnership received cash of $1,343,121 ($1,311,428 of principal and
$31,693 of interest) as payment in full of this promissory note.  

9.   
       Equipment
    Notes Receivable    

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, investments in equipment notes receivable, including accrued interest, consisted of
the following:  

Hydro-electric
Generating Plant   Northern Ireland   

On
April 4, 2013, the Partnership entered into an equipment note receivable (the  Note ) for  1,440,000 with a
special purpose entity controlled by a third party. This special purpose entity was organized to provide financing for a hydro-electric
generating plant located in Northern Ireland. The plant serves as collateral for the Note. The Note accrues interest at 12.0%
per year with the interest payable quarterly in arrears. The proceeds from the Note were used for the purchase of a hydro-electric
generating plant located in Northern Ireland. The entire principal balance and unpaid interest may be repaid, at any time, along
with a redemption fee, as defined in the Note. The borrower s parent company has guaranteed the full amount of the Note.  

Manufacturing
Equipment and Inventory   

On
January 24, 2014, Bravo entered into a participation agreement with a lender to purchase manufacturing equipment and inventory.
Bravo lent $1,175,000 to a third party under a note receivable agreement on March 4, 2014. The interest on the note was charged
at a rate of 12% per annum and interest was payable in twelve monthly installments of $11,750 each. The note matured on March
4, 2015 and the principal balance due was payable in one lump sum. The borrower was unable to remit the lump sum payment. The
note is secured by the equipment and inventory of the borrower. The note is on non-accrual status as a result of non-payment.
Based on a third party appraisal of the collateral value of the equipment, the Investment Manager believes that there is sufficient
collateral value to cover the outstanding balance of the note receivable. Additionally, the equipment is under the control of
a related party of the Partnership. Bravo borrowed $705,000 from the lender which accrues interest at 7.75% and is repayable with
the proceeds from the investments.  

10.   
       Investment
    in Participation Interests    

On
October 9, 2013, the Partnership formed Delta, which is 100% owned by the Partnership. The sole purpose of Delta was to acquire
an $8,540,000 interest in two, less than 1 year old, bulk carrier vessels. Each vessel is subject to an initial 6 year charter
of which approximately 4 years remain. In accordance with the participation agreement, Delta has the right to force a sale of
the vessels at any time the sale proceeds would be sufficient to provide Delta with a 14% internal rate of return on an unleveraged
basis. The Partnership incurred $4,200,000 of debt relating to the transaction, accruing interest at 10.9% per annum with maturity
in December 2020. The debt will be repaid with cash flows generated from the underlying assets acquired.  

The
investment is accounted for using the cost method whereas the Partnership will recognize as income, dividends received that are
distributed from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition. Dividends received in excess of earnings
subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions of cost of the investment.
In conjunction with the October 2013 transaction, the Partnership recorded a purchase discount of $340,000, which was recorded
as a deferred gain on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The gain will be amortized over the expected
term of the investment and will be recorded as income.  

11.   
       Equipment
    Investment through SPV    

On
June 22, 2016, Delta entered into a sale and assignment of partnership interest agreement with a third party. Under the terms
of the agreement, Delta acquired an 88.20% (90% of 98%) economic interest in a portfolio of a container feeder vessel. Delta acquired
their economic interest in the vessel through a limited partnership interest in Boxship Holding, which acquired and operates the
container feeder vessel. Boxship Holding acquired a container feeder vessel for $3,546,016 and drydocking reserves of $747,123
for an aggregate investment of $4,293,139. As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership has an aggregate investment balance of $4,318,409.  

Boxship
Holding acquired and operates a container feeder vessel which collects shipping containers from different ports and transports
them to central container terminals where they are loaded to bigger vessels. For the period ended September 30, 2016, Boxship
Holding recorded income of approximately $575,000 primarily from charter rental fees less total expenses of $852,000, consisting
of ship operating expenses, of approximately $550,000, ship management fees and charter commissions fees of approximately $145,000,
general and administrative expenses, of approximately $16,000, depreciation expense, of approximately $113,000 and interest expense
of approximately $28,000 resulting in a net loss of approximately $277,000.  

12.   
       Collateralized
    Loan Receivable     

On
July 29, 2016, the Partnership funded $277,893, after applicable exchange rates, under a Loan Note Instrument to provide financing
to a borrower which acquired shares of a special purpose entity that previously acquired, by assignment, the rights to lease a
parcel of land in Ireland on which planning permissions have been granted to construct an aerobic digestion plant. This is part
of a project financing and long term lease of the aerobic digestion plant. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the loan facility earned interest income of $8,754.  

Other
assets primarily include approximately $533,000 of several leases that were transferred from operating leases due to expiration
of lease terms and approximately $680,000 related to the Partnership s Equipment Investment through SPV. In addition, in
December 2013 the Partnership funded  500,000 to an escrow account for a lease that has not been executed as of September
30, 2016.

       Non-recourse
    Loans Payable    

In
September 2013, the Partnership sold the receivable related to the three year lease extension entered into by the lessee of reusable
plastic storage containers in which the Partnership initially had an 18.08% participation interest. The net proceeds to the Partnership
on the non-recourse sale of receivables were approximately $1,400,000. The receivable related to the note sale accrues interest
at 8.5% per annum with an expected maturity date of July 31, 2016. In June 2016, the Partnership paid $148,361 as payment in full
on the balance of this loan payable.  

On
October 29, 2013, Delta borrowed $4,200,000 in the form of a senior participation from the same third party lender as disclosed
in the Bravo loan above. The loan accrues interest at 10.9% per annum. The debt will be repaid with cash flows generated from
the underlying asset acquired. The senior participant, as collateral, has a first priority security interest in all of the leased
assets acquired by Delta as well as a senior participation interest in the proceeds from the leased assets, while the Partnership
has a junior participation interest until the loan is repaid in full. All of the cash proceeds received from these assets will
be applied first against the outstanding principal balance of the senior participation with any excess distributed to the junior
participants. There was no stated or agreed upon repayment term for the principal. In connection with the Boxship Holding transaction,
on June 22, 2016, Delta and the third party amended and restated the participation agreement and Delta borrowed an additional
$3,443,185 in the form of a senior participation instrument. All other terms of the participation agreement were not amended.
The outstanding principal balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $6,422,110 and $3,077,090, respectively.

Overview    

We
are a Delaware limited partnership formed on March 10, 2010. We operate a fund in which the capital invested by our Limited Partners
is pooled together. This pool of capital is then used to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment
and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. The pooled capital contributions
are also used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and to fund a capital reserve.  

Our
principal investment strategy is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-savings) equipment with high in-place
value and long, relative to the investment term, economic life. We expect to achieve our investment strategy by making investments
in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include: (i) purchasing equipment
and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject
to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to
time, we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers.  

Many
of our investments are, and we anticipate will continue to be, structured as full payout or operating leases. Full payout leases
generally are leases under which the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate
return without consideration of the residual value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the expiration
of the lease term. Operating leases generally are leases under which the aggregate non-cancelable rental payments during the original
term of the lease, on a net present value basis, are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets
leased under the lease.  

We
commenced our Operating Period on June 29, 2011 with our first equipment transaction. During the Operating Period, we invested
most of the net offering proceeds in items of equipment that are subject to leases, equipment financing transactions, and residual
ownership rights in leased equipment. After the net offering proceeds were invested, additional investments were made with the
cash proceeds generated from our initial investments, to the extent that cash was not needed for expenses, reserves, or distributions
to Limited Partners. The investment in additional equipment in this manner is called  reinvestment.  After the termination
of our Operating Period, we will sell our assets in the ordinary course of business, a time frame called the Liquidation Period.
The Liquidation Period started on June 29, 2014 and is expected to last approximately four years, unless it is extended, at the
sole discretion of our General Partner for a maximum of two one-year extensions.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

An
understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our condensed consolidated financial results. The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires our General Partner and our Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
primarily include the determination of allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment
losses and the estimated useful lives and residual values of the leased equipment we acquire. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Lease
Classification and Revenue Recognition   

Each
equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, which is determined at lease inception
based upon the terms of each lease, or when there are significant changes to the lease terms. We capitalize initial direct costs
associated with the origination and funding of lease assets. Initial direct costs include both internal costs (e.g., labor and
overhead) and external broker fees incurred with the origination. Costs related to leases that are not consummated are not eligible
for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense. For a finance lease, initial direct
costs are capitalized and amortized over the lease term using the effective interest rate method. For an operating lease, the
initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term.  

For
finance leases, we record, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed
residual value of the equipment at lease termination, the initial direct costs related to the lease, if any, and the related unearned
income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated
unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the
term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.  

For
operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables
are included in accounts receivable until collected. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. Rental
income received in advance is the difference between the timing of the receivables billed and the income recognized on a straight-line
basis.  

For
leases subject to equipment notes receivable, specific payment terms were reached requiring payments which resulted in the recognition
of interest income. This income is recognized over the course of the lease agreement.  

Our
Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part
of its process, the investment committee determines the residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved.
The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential
lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee s business, the length
of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance
with our impairment review policy.  

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term
fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant
number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated
using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and
industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.  

Asset
Impairments   

The
significant assets in our investment portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators
of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and
exceeds its fair value. If there is an indication of impairment, we estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected
to be generated by an asset less the future out-flows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined
to exist, it is recorded in the statement of operations in the period the determination is made. The events or changes in circumstances
that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are, (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than
its carrying value, (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and (iii) it does not appear likely that the estimated
proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual value in the asset. The preparation of the
undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents or receipts from the
sale of the residual value investment, estimated downtime between re-leasing events, and the amount of re-leasing costs. The Investment
Manager s review for impairment will include a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators, including third
party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions
for specific asset types, and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could
affect the fair value of the asset.  

Equipment
Notes Receivable   

Equipment
notes receivable are reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized
deferred fees, premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Costs to originate loans, if any, are reported as other assets in our
condensed consolidated balance sheets. Income is recognized over the life of the note agreement. On certain equipment notes receivable,
specific payment terms were reached requiring prepayments which resulted in the recognition of unearned interest income. Unearned
income, discounts and premiums, if any, are amortized to interest income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations
using the effective interest rate method. Equipment notes receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments
are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, the Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with
payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon the Investment Manager s judgment, accounts may be placed in a non-accrual
status with any accrued and uncollected revenue being reversed. Accounts on a non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual
status when the account has been brought current and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. Revenue
on non-accrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received.  

Cost
method of accounting   

We
record our investment in participation interests at cost. Under the cost method of accounting for investments, dividends are the
basis for recognition by an investor of earnings from an investment. We recognize as income dividends received that are distributed
from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition. The net accumulated earnings of the investee subsequent
to the date of investment are recognized by us only to the extent distributed by the investee as dividends. Dividends received
in excess of earnings subsequent to the date of investment are considered a return of investment and are recorded as a reduction
of the cost of the investment.  

Depreciation   

We
record depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation,
we first determine the depreciable equipment cost, which is the cost less the estimated residual value. The estimated residual
value is our estimate of the value of the equipment at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded by applying the straight-line
method of depreciation to the depreciable equipment cost over the lease term.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to Leases Analysis),
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.
The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases
on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use
certain transition relief. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis), effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is
intended to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations, and securitization structures. The amendments in the ASU affect the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations.
In addition, the amendments in this ASU simplify and improve current U.S. GAAP by reducing the number of consolidation models.
The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (the  2016 Quarter ) compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015 (the  2015 Quarter )    

Our
revenue for the 2016 Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter is summarized as follows:   

For
the 2016 Quarter we earned total revenue of $1,022,120 which is a decrease of approximately $733,000 from our 2015 Quarter. The
decrease in total revenue was due to a decrease in gain on sale of assets of approximately $811,000, a decrease in rental income
of approximately $150,000, a decrease in finance income of approximately $257,000 and a decrease in interest income of approximately
$87,000 offset by an increase in income from our equipment investment through SPV of approximately $571,000 and an increase in
income from investments of approximately $2,000. The decrease in total revenue is primarily due to the sale of our assets in prior
quarters as we are in our Liquidation Period which results in a decrease in rental, finance and interest income.  

For
the 2015 Quarter, we earned total revenue of $1,755,083, which is an increase of approximately $248,000 from our 2014 Quarter.
The increase in total revenue was due to an increase in rental income of approximately $131,000 and an increase in gain on sale
of assets of approximately $449,000 offset by a decrease in finance income of approximately $152,000, a decrease in income from
investments of approximately $115,000 and a decrease in interest income of approximately $66,000. The increase in rental income
is primarily due to the reclassification of the leases for modular accommodations from other assets to operating leases. The increase
in gain on sale of assets and decrease in finance income is primarily due to the sale of a finance lease during the 2015 Quarter.
The decrease in income from investments is a result of no income from our investments in Echo and Echo II during the 2015 Quarter
due to the sale of Echo and Echo II s lease portfolios during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
expenses for the  2016  Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter are summarized as follows:   

During
the 2016 Quarter, we incurred total expenses of $999,257 versus total expenses of $580,304 for the 2015 Quarter. We also incurred
expenses of $584,598 from our equipment investment through SPV. The primary reason for the increase of approximately $419,000
from the 2015 Quarter was due to expenses from our equipment investment through SPV offset by a decrease in interest expense from
the 2015 Quarter due to paydowns of loan principal on the non-recourse loans payable.  

For
the 2016 Quarter we generated foreign currency transaction losses of $205,687, which were incurred as follows: (i) approximately
$205,000 was related directly to our equipment leasing transactions or project financings in the United Kingdom and (ii) the remaining
balance was related to foreign exchange fluctuation changes in our cash accounts located in the United Kingdom. The exchange rate
between the British Pound and the United States of America dollar decreased approximately 3.1% during the 2016 Quarter. For the
2015 Quarter, we generated foreign currency transaction losses of $365,580, which were incurred as follows: (i) approximately
$360,000 was related directly to our equipment leasing transactions or project financings in the United Kingdom and (ii) the remaining
balance was related to foreign exchange fluctuation changes in our cash accounts located in the United Kingdom. The exchange rate
between the British Pound and the United States of America dollar decreased approximately 4.0% during the 2015 Quarter. We do
not currently, and we have no plans in the future, to hedge our British Pound Sterling exposure. We expect to have gains and losses
relating to our investments denominated in foreign currencies and the swings may be large from year to year. We do not hedge our
foreign currency exposures and may not hedge such exposures in the future.  

Net
Income   

As
a result of the factors discussed above we generated a net loss for the 2016 Quarter of $182,824 compared to net income for the
2015 Quarter of $809,199.  

Results
of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (the  2016 Period ) compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015 (the  2015 Period )    

Our
revenue for the 2016 Period compared to the 2015 Period is summarized as follows:   

For
the 2016 Period we earned total revenue of $2,411,919 which is a decrease of approximately $1,914,000 from our 2015 Period. The
decrease in total revenue was due to a decrease in rental income of approximately $625,000, a decrease in finance income of approximately
$992,000, a decrease in interest income of approximately $242,000 and a decrease in gain on sale of assets of approximately $704,000
offset by an increase in income from our equipment investment through SPV of approximately $571,000 and an increase in income
from investments of approximately $88,000. The decrease in total revenue is primarily due to the sale of our assets as we are
in our Liquidation Period which results in a decrease in rental, finance and interest income.  

For
the 2015 Period, we earned total revenue of $4,325,611, which is an increase of approximately $598,000 from our 2014 Period. The
increase in total revenue was due to an increase in rental income of approximately $811,000, an increase in gain on sale of assets
of approximately $518,000 and an increase in other income of approximately $10,000 offset by a decrease in finance income of approximately
$66,000, a decrease in interest income of approximately $416,000 and a decrease in income from investments of approximately $258,000.
The increase in rental income is primarily due to the reclassification of the leases for modular accommodations from other assets
to operating leases. The increase in gain on sale of assets and decrease in finance income is primarily due to the sale of a finance
lease during the 2015 Period. The decrease in income from investments is a result of no income from our investments in Echo and
Echo II during the 2015 Quarter due to the sale of Echo and Echo II s lease portfolios during the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  

Our
expenses for the  2016  Period compared to the 2015 Period are summarized as follows:   

During
the 2016 Period, we incurred total expenses of $2,290,458 versus total expenses of $1,836,850 for the 2015 Period. We also incurred
expenses of $849,135 from our equipment investment through SPV. The primary reason for the increase of approximately $454,000
from the 2015 Period was due to our equipment investment through SPV offset by a decrease in interest expense from the 2015 Period
due to paydowns of loan principal on the non-recourse loans payable.  

For
the 2016 Period we generated foreign currency transaction losses of $480,383, which were incurred as follows: (i) approximately
$473,000 was related directly to our equipment leasing transactions or project financings in the United Kingdom and (ii) the remaining
balance was related to foreign exchange fluctuation changes in our cash accounts located in the United Kingdom. The exchange rate
between the British Pound and the United States of America dollar decreased approximately 12.4% during the 2016 Period. For the
2015 Period, we generated foreign currency transaction losses of $144,653, which were incurred as follows: (i) approximately $150,000
was related directly to our equipment leasing transactions or project financings in the United Kingdom and (ii) the offsetting
remaining balance was related to foreign exchange fluctuation changes in our cash accounts located in the United Kingdom. The
exchange rate between the British Pound and the United States of America dollar decreased approximately 2.4% during the 2015 Period.
We do not currently, and we have no plans in the future, to hedge our British Pound Sterling exposure. We expect to have gains
and losses relating to our investments denominated in foreign currencies and the swings may be large from year to year. We do
not hedge our foreign currency exposures and may not hedge such exposures in the future.  

Net
Income   

As
a result of the factors discussed above we generated a net loss for the 2016 Period of $358,922 compared to net income for the
2015 Period of $2,344,108.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Sources
and Uses of Cash    

Sources
of Liquidity    

We
are currently in our Liquidation Period. The Liquidation Period is the time-frame in which we sell equipment under lease in the
normal course of business. During this time period we anticipate that a substantial portion of our cash outflows will be from
operating activities and the majority of our cash inflows are expected to be from operating and investing activities. We believe
that the cash inflows will be sufficient to finance our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including semi-annual
distributions to our Limited Partners, general and administrative expenses, interest on the Partnership s, Bravo s
and Delta s non-recourse loans payable and fees paid to our Investment Manager.  

Operating
Activities    

During
2016, we had cash inflows from operating activities of $86,780. This was principally due to a net loss of approximately $359,000
and an increase in accounts receivable and other assets of approximately $780,000 from sales of an operating lease and a finance
lease. We also had a non-cash decrease of approximately $161,000 from gain on sale of assets. Offsetting these cash outflows were
cash inflows from cash collections from rental payments from both our finance and operating leases as well as interest income
on the equipment notes receivable. We received cash of approximately $101,000 from our finance leases during the 2016 Period.
The majority of our leases are payable in British Pound Sterling, therefore future cash inflows will be affected by the foreign
currency exchange rates at the time we receive these payments. Additionally, we had a non-cash increase of approximately $973,000
which represented depreciation and amortization and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses. We anticipate that we
will generate net cash inflows from operations but we may experience swings due mostly to changes in the foreign currency transaction
gains or losses from year to year.  

During
2015, we generated cash inflows from operating activities of $4,419,027. This was principally due to net income of approximately
$2,344,000 and to cash collections from rental payments from both our finance and operating leases as well as interest income
on the equipment notes receivable. We received cash of approximately $1,232,000 from our finance leases and cash of approximately
$113,000 from our equipment notes receivable during the 2015 Period. The majority of our leases are payable in British Pound Sterling,
therefore future cash inflows will be affected by the foreign currency exchange rates at the time we receive these payments. The
cash inflows were offset by various non-cash deductions which totaled approximately $1,864,000 and consisted of finance income
and gains on sale of assets. These non-cash deductions were offset by a non-cash increase of approximately $725,000 which represented
depreciation and amortization, accrued interest income, unrealized foreign currency transaction losses and investment loss from
equity method investments. We anticipate that we will continue to generate net cash inflows from operations but we may experience
swings due mostly to changes in the foreign currency transaction gains or losses from year to year.  

Investing
Activities    

Cash
used in investing activities for the 2016 Period was $1,908,358. We paid approximately $3,893,000 for the purchase of a container
feeder vessel. We paid approximately $278,000 for the purchase of a collateralized loan receivable. We received proceeds of approximately
$943,000 from the sale of leased assets and approximately $1,320,000 for principal payments received on convertible notes.  

Cash
provided by investing activities for the 2015 Period was $10,516,725. We received proceeds of approximately $706,000 and $379,000
as a return of capital from our investments in Echo and Echo II, respectively, due to the sale of all their portfolios of leases.
We also received proceeds of approximately $9,800,000 from the sale of leased assets and approximately $43,000 for principal payments
received on convertible notes. We anticipate generating cash inflows during the Liquidation Period as we sell our various equipment
leases.  

Financings
and Borrowings    

Cash
used in financing activities was $407,489 for the 2016 Period. During the 2016 Period, we received proceeds from loans payable
of approximately $3,847,000 and we collected approximately $100,000 from a note receivable with our Investment Manager. Offsetting
this increase was cash outflows of approximately $3,728,000 for distributions to our Limited Partners and we paid approximately
$1,099,000 of principal payments on the loans payable.  

Cash
used by financing activities was $13,102,109 for the 2015 Period. During the 2015 Period, we paid approximately $7,232,000 of
principal payments on the loans payable and approximately $5,960,000 for distributions to our limited partners. Offsetting this
decrease was cash inflows of approximately $90,000 from a note receivable with our Investment Manager.  

Distributions    

We
make, at the sole discretion of our Investment Manager and contingent upon the availability of funds, semi-annual cash distributions
to each Limited Partner computed at 3% (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner) of each Limited Partner s
capital contribution which began six months after our initial closing, which occurred on May 2, 2011. We made distributions to
our Limited Partners through the Operating Period which concluded on May 2, 2013. We are currently in our Liquidation Period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made cash distributions to our Limited Partners totaling $3,714,065. We did
not make a cash distribution to the General Partner during the nine months ended September 30, 2016; however, we accrued approximately
$138,400 for distributions due to the General Partner at September 30, 2016. Although the timing of distributions may become irregular,
we intend to follow the semi-annual distribution schedule at the targeted distribution rate provided the cash from operations
can sustain the distributions.  

Commitments
and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions    

Commitment
and Contingencies   

Our
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99% to our Limited Partners and 1% to our General Partner until the Limited Partners
have received total distributions equal to each Limited Partner s capital contribution plus an 8%, compounded annually,
cumulative return on each Limited Partner s capital contribution. After such time, income, losses and distributions will
be allocated 80% to our Limited Partners and 20% to our General Partner.  

We
enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known.  

In
the normal course of business, we enter into contracts of various types, including lease contracts, contracts for the sale or
purchase of lease assets, and management contracts. It is prevalent industry practice for most contracts of any significant value
to include provisions that each of the contracting parties, in addition to assuming liability for breaches of the representations,
warranties, and covenants that are part of the underlying contractual obligations, to also assume an obligation to indemnify and
hold the other contractual party harmless for such breaches, and for harm caused by such party s gross negligence and willful
misconduct, including, in certain instances, certain costs and expenses arising from the contract. Generally, to the extent these
contracts are performed in the ordinary course of business under the reasonable business judgment of our General Partner and our
Investment Manager, no liability will arise as a result of these provisions. Our General Partner and our Investment Manager knows
of no facts or circumstances that would make our contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial
transactions between businesses. Accordingly, we believe that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course
of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under our similar commitments
is remote. Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, we would separately record and/or disclose such liability
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions   

None.  

Contractual
Obligations   

We
make, at the sole discretion of our Investment Manager and contingent upon the availability of funds, semi-annual cash distributions
to each limited partner computed at 3% (pro-rated to the date of admission for each limited partner) of each limited partner s
capital contribution which began six months after our initial closing, which occurred on May 2, 2011. We expect to make distributions
to our Limited Partners through the Liquidation Period.  

Subsequent
Events    

On November 2, 2016, the lessee of the bottle recycling and extrusion line located in the United Kingdom was
sold as part of a restructuring transaction. As stated in Note 5, the Partnership's position in this lease was previously reserved
for based on the restructuring and management will continue to evaluate the Partnership's position in this lease based on the sale
to a third party.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

There
are no material changes to the disclosures related to these items since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated December

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our General Partner
and Investment Manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our General
Partner and Investment Manager, including its Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
concluded that our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

In
designing and evaluating our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures, our General
Partner and Investment Manager recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable
assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations
in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override
of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated
future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with
established policies or procedures.  

Evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting   

Our
General Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of condensed
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Partnership; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Partnership
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Partnership; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s
assets that could have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Our
General Partner and our Investment Manager have assessed the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control Integrated Framework.   

Based
on their assessment, our General Partner and our Investment Manager believe that, as of September 30, 2016, its internal control
over financial reporting is effective.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   

There
were no additional material changes in our General Partner s or our Investment Manager s internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
their internal control over financial reporting.

organizational and offering expenses were limited to $557,222 or 2% of total equity raised.
