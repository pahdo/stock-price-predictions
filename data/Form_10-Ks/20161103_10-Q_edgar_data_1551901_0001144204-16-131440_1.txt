NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Nature of Operations   

Stellus Capital Investment Corporation ( we ,
 us ,  our  and the  Company ) was formed as a Maryland corporation on May 18, 2012 ( Inception )
and is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified investment management company. The Company is applying the guidance of
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946,  Financial Services Investment Companies . The Company has
elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the  1940 Act ) and treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company s investment
activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management, LLC ( Stellus Capital  or the  Advisor ). 

On November 7, 2012, the Company priced its
initial public offering (the  Offering ), at a price of $15.00 per share. In connection with the Offering, the Company
sold 9,200,000 shares (including 1,200,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters  exercise of the overallotment option) for
gross proceeds of $138,000,000. Since Inception, the Company has raised $151,250,000 including (i) $500,010 of seed capital contributed
by Stellus Capital, (ii) $12,749,990 in a private placement to certain purchasers, including persons and entities associated with
Stellus Capital and (iii) $138,000,000 in the Offering. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Company s
initial portfolio, the Company issued $29,159,145 in shares of the Company s common stock. The Company s shares are
currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  SCM . 

The Company has established the following wholly
owned subsidiaries: SCIC   Consolidated Blocker 1, Inc., SCIC   SKP Blocker 1, Inc. and SCIC   APE
Blocker 1, Inc., and SCIC   HUF Blocker 1, Inc., which are structured as Delaware entities, to hold equity or equity-like
investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities)
(collectively, the  Taxable Subsidiaries ). The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( U.S. GAAP ) reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by them are included in the consolidated
financial statements. 

On June 14, 2013, we formed Stellus Capital
SBIC, LP (the  SBIC subsidiary ), a Delaware limited partnership, and its general partner, Stellus Capital SBIC GP,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. On June 20, 2014, the SBIC subsidiary received
a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) to operate as a small business investment company ( SBIC )
under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Company Act of 1958. The SBIC subsidiary and its general partner are consolidated
for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by it are included in the consolidated financial statements. 

The SBIC license allows the SBIC subsidiary
to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary
procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a
ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid
at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven
spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the SBIC s
assets over the Company s stockholders in the event the Company liquidates the SBIC subsidiary or the SBA exercises its remedies
under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the SBIC subsidiary upon an event of default. See footnote (2) of the Consolidated
Schedule of Investments. SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $150 million when it
has at least $75 million in regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA, receives a capital commitment from the SBA
and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
SBIC subsidiary had $32.5 million of regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA, and has received commitments from
the SBA of $65.0 million. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SBIC subsidiary had $65.0 million of SBA-guaranteed
debentures outstanding.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company s investment objective is
to maximize the total return to its stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related
equity investments in middle-market companies. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective by originating and investing
primarily in private U.S. middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, with
corresponding equity co-investments. The Company sources investments primarily through the extensive network of relationships that
the principals of Stellus Capital have developed with financial sponsor firms, financial institutions, middle-market companies,
management teams and other professional intermediaries. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information
and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying the annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are omitted. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 

In the opinion of management, the unaudited
consolidated financial results included herein contain all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered
necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods included herein. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
to be expected for the full year. Also, the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain reclassifications
have been made to certain prior period balances to conform with current presentation. In accordance with Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act, the Company does not consolidate portfolio company investments. The accounting
records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. 

Portfolio Investment Classification   

The Company classifies its portfolio investments
in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act as follows: (a)  Control Investments  are defined as investments
in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to maintain greater than 50% of the board representation,
(b)  Affiliate Investments  are defined as investments in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities
and does not have rights to maintain greater than 50% of the board representation, and (c)  Non-controlled, non-affiliate
investments  are defined as investments that are neither Control Investments or Affiliate Investments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

At September 30, 2016, cash balances totaling
$8,640,005 exceeded FDIC insurance protection levels of $250,000 by $8,390,005, subjecting the Company to risk related to the uninsured
balance. All of the Company s cash deposits are held at large established high credit quality financial institutions and
management believes that risk of loss associated with any uninsured balances is remote. 

Cash consists of bank demand deposits. We deem
certain U.S. Treasury Bills and other high-quality, short-term debt securities as cash equivalents. At the end of each fiscal quarter,
we may take proactive steps to ensure we are in compliance with the RIC diversification requirements under Subchapter M of the
Code, which are dependent upon the composition of our total assets at quarter end. We may accomplish this in several ways, including
purchasing U.S. Treasury Bills and closing out positions after quarter-end or temporarily drawing down on the Credit Facility (see
Note 7). On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held no U.S. Treasury Bills.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (Unaudited)  

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of the consolidated statements
of assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Changes
in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual
results to differ materially. 

Deferred Financing Costs, Prepaid Loan Fees on SBA Debentures
and Prepaid Loan Structure Fees   

Deferred financing costs, prepaid loan fees on SBA-guaranteed debentures
and prepaid loan structure fees consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing of our Credit Facility, the Notes
(See Note 8) and SBA-guaranteed debentures and are capitalized at the time of payment. These are costs are presented as a direct
deduction to the carrying amount of the respective liability and amortized using the straight line method over the term of the
respective instrument. 

Deferred Offering Costs   

Deferred offering costs consist of fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the offer and sale of the Company s common stock and bonds, including legal, accounting, printing
fees and other related expenses, as well as costs incurred in connection with the filing of a shelf registration statement. These
costs are capitalized when incurred and recognized as a reduction of offering proceeds when the offering becomes effective. During
the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company determined that it was no longer likely to issue shares under its current shelf registration
statement. As a result, the Company expensed $261,761 of previously capitalized deferred offering costs in the second quarter of
this year. 

Investments   

As a BDC, the Company will generally invest in
illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by
our board of directors, the Company intends to value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market
quotations. The Company will value these investments based on these market values from an independent pricing service or at the
median between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market
maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily
available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Such determination of fair values
may involve subjective judgments and estimates. The Company also engages independent third party valuation providers to review
the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least twice annually. 

Investments purchased within 90 days of the valuation
date will be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value. With respect to
unquoted securities, our board of directors, will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow
models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase
transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the board of directors will use the pricing indicated by the external
event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because the Company expects that there will not be a readily available
market for many of the investments in its portfolio, the Company expects to value most of its portfolio investments at fair value
as determined in good faith by the board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation
process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market
value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available
market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 

In following these approaches, the types of
factors that will be taken into account in fair value pricing investments will include, as relevant, but not be limited to: 

available current market data, including relevant and applicable market
trading and transaction comparables;

Revenue Recognition   

We record interest income on an accrual
basis to the extent such interest is deemed collectible. We will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason
to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are
capitalized, and we then accrete or amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income. Upon the prepayment
of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fee is recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums
on loans and debt securities as other income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on the ex-dividend date. 

Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized
Appreciation or Depreciation   

We measure realized gains or losses by
the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard
to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects
the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized
appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 

Payment-in-Kind Interest   

We have investments in our portfolio that
contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest provision. Any PIK interest is added to the principal balance of such investments
and is recorded as income, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is collectible. In order to maintain
our status as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends, even if we have
not collected any cash. 

Investment Transaction Costs   

Costs that are material associated with
an investment transaction, including legal expenses, are included in the cost basis of purchases and deducted from the proceeds
of sales unless such costs are reimbursed by the borrower. 

Receivables and Payables for Unsettled Securities Transaction   

The Company records all investments on
a trade date basis. 

U.S. Federal Income Taxes   

The Company has elected to be treated
as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intends to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment
applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders
at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. So long as the Company maintains its
status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that
it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the Company
represents obligations of the Company s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
September 30, 2016 
(Unaudited)  

To avoid a 4% U.S. federal excise tax
on undistributed earnings, the Company is required to distribute each calendar year the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income for
such calendar year (ii) 98.2% of its net capital gains for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year (iii) any
income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which the Company paid no federal income tax. The Company, at
its discretion, may choose not to distribute all of its taxable income for the calendar year and pay a non-deductible 4% excise
tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the
amount available to be distributed to stockholders. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual
taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, the Company accrues
excise taxes on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. The Company incurred no excise tax expense for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company evaluates tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not 
of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold
would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the applicable period. Although the Company files U.S. federal and state tax returns,
its major tax jurisdiction is U.S. federal. The 2012, 2013 and 2014 federal tax years for the Company remain subject to examination
by the Internal Revenue Service. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company had not recorded a liability for any unrecognized tax positions. Management s evaluation of uncertain
tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going
analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company s policy is to include interest and penalties
related to income taxes, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses. There were no such expenses for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Taxable Subsidiaries are direct
wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company that have elected to be taxable entities. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit the Company
to hold equity investments in portfolio companies, which are  pass through  entities for tax purposes and continue
to comply with the  source income  requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries
are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax
assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if
any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

The Taxable Subsidiaries use the liability
method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for
the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Taxable income generally differs from
net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses.
Taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in
taxable income until they are realized. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded deferred income tax benefit of $39,965 and $362,116, respectively, related to the Taxable Subsidiaries.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded deferred income tax provision of $147,439 and $33,181,
respectively, related to the Taxable Subsidiaries. In addition, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
a deferred tax liability of $19,607 and $381,723, respectively. 

Earnings per Share   

Basic per share calculations are computed
utilizing the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company has no common stock equivalents.
As a result, there is no difference between diluted earnings per share and basic per share amounts.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards   

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements
are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standards setting bodies that are adopted
by the Company as of the specified effective date. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15
- Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce
diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance addresses the
classification of various transactions including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments,
contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investments, beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and others. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017,
and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on
its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
- Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires
entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience,
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition
requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which includes amendments
for enhanced clarification of the guidance. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU
2015-17 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires entities to present deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. It simplifies the current guidance, which
requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods,
and early adoption is permitted. Entities are permitted to apply the amendments either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company
believes that this guidance will not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2015-03 - Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs was effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented as a deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. Accordingly, the Company
has adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2016. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period line items on the Company s
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as the new guidance requires retrospective application. Therefore, the December
31, 2015 Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities including the reclassifications must be presented as unaudited in this
filing.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-15 - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. In connection with
the preparation of interim and annual reports, the Company s management will evaluate whether conditions or events exist
that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that
the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued, when
applicable), and, if so, disclose that fact. Additionally, the Company s management must evaluate and disclose whether its

the guidance as of January 1, 2016 and there is no impact on its consolidated financial statement. 

NOTE 2      RELATED PARTY ARRANGEMENTS  

Investment Advisory Agreement  

The Company has entered into an investment
advisory agreement with Stellus Capital under which they serve as our investment advisor. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company
has agreed to pay to Stellus Capital an annual base management fee of 1.75% of gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed
funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents, and an annual incentive fee. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of $1,574,354 and $4,673,568, respectively. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of $1,462,024 and $4,322,488, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,574,354 and $1,518,779, respectively, were payable to Stellus Capital. 

The incentive fee has two components,
investment income and capital gains, as follows: 

Investment Income Incentive Fee   

The investment income component ( Investment
Income Incentive Fee ) is calculated, and payable, quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net
investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a cumulative total return requirement and to deferral
of non-cash amounts. The pre-incentive fee net investment income, which is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s
net assets attributable to the Company s common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will have a 2.0% (which
is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate (also referred to as the  Hurdle ). Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest
income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses
for the quarter excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with
a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued
income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Advisor receives no incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which the
Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle. Subject to the cumulative total return requirement
described below, the Advisor receives 100% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for any calendar quarter
with respect to that portion of the pre-incentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle but is
less than 2.5% (which is 10.0% annualized) of net assets (also referred to as the  Catch-up ) and 20.0% of the Company s
pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter, if any, greater than 2.5% (10.0% annualized) of net assets. 

STELLUS CAPITAL INVESTMENT
CORPORATION 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
September 30, 2016 
(Unaudited)  

The foregoing incentive fee is subject
to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment
income is payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then
current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters.
In other words, any Investment Income Incentive Fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) 20% of
the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle,
subject to the Catch-up, and (ii) (x) 20% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current
and 11 preceding quarters   minus   (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar
quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the  cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations  is the amount,
if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation
of the Company for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the Advisor is not paid the portion of such
incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest until the Company actually receives such interest in cash. 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $1,110,297 and $3,121,395, respectively, of Investment Income
Incentive Fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $954,908 and $2,914,633, respectively,
of Investment Income Incentive Fees. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,437,030 and $607,956, respectively, of
such Investment Income Incentive Fees were payable to the Advisor, of which     $1,237,801
and $401,573, respectively, were currently payable (as explained below). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $199,229
and $206,383, respectively, of Investment Income Incentive Fees incurred but not paid by the Company were generated from deferred
interest (i.e. PIK interest, certain discount accretion and deferred interest) and are not payable until such deferred amounts
are received by the Company in cash.  

Capital Gains Incentive Fee   

The Company also pays the Advisor an incentive
fee based on capital gains (the  Capital Gains Incentive Fee ). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is determined and payable
in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement, as of the termination
date). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is equal to 20.0% of the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from
inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and cumulative
aggregate unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year. The aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains
Incentive Fees is subtracted from such Capital Gains Incentive Fee calculated. 

U.S. GAAP requires that the incentive
fee accrual considers the cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation of
investments or other financial instruments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such realized gains and
losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation were realized, even though such realized gains and losses and unrealized
capital appreciation or depreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment
advisory agreement. There can be no assurance that unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly,
such fees, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the investment advisory agreement, and may never be
paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company incurred no Capital Gains Incentive Fee. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no Capital Gains
Incentive Fees were payable to the Advisor. 

The following tables summarize the components
of the incentive fees discussed above:

Director Fees  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded an expense relating to director fees of $73,000 and $251,000, respectively. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an expense relating to director fees of $76,000 and $260,000, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no fees were payable relating to director fees.  

Co-Investments  

We received exemptive relief from the
SEC to co-invest with investment funds managed by Stellus Capital where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as
well as applicable law (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). Under the terms of the relief
permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by Stellus Capital, a  required majority  (as defined in Section
57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction,
including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and
our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction
is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. We intend
to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with private credit funds managed
by Stellus Capital that has an investment strategy that is identical to our investment strategy. We believe that such co-investments
may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. 

License Agreement  

We have entered into a license agreement
with Stellus Capital under which Stellus Capital has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  Stellus
Capital.  Under this agreement, we have a right to use the  Stellus Capital  name for so long as Stellus Capital
or one of its affiliates remains our investment advisor. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right
to the  Stellus Capital  name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the investment advisory
agreement with Stellus Capital is in effect. 

Administration Agreement  

We have entered into an administration
agreement with Stellus Capital pursuant to which Stellus Capital will furnish us with office facilities and equipment and will
provide us with the clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations.
Under this administration agreement, Stellus Capital will perform, or oversee the performance of, our required administrative services,
which includes, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing
reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. 

Included in administrative services expense
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded expenses of $214,453 and $690,361, respectively, relating
to the administration agreement. Included in administrative services expense for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, the Company recorded expenses of $191,552 and $549,436, respectively, relating to the administration agreement. As of September
30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, $214,453 and $195,221, respectively, remained payable to Stellus Capital relating to the administration
agreement.

NOTE 3      DISTRIBUTIONS  

Distributions are generally declared
by the Company s board of directors each calendar quarter and recognized as distribution liabilities on the ex-dividend date.
The Company intends to distribute net realized gains ( i.e. , net capital gains in excess of net capital losses), if any,
at least annually. The stockholder distributions, if any, will be determined by the board of directors. Any distribution to stockholders
will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. 

The following table reflects the Company s
distributions declared and paid or to be paid on its common stock as of September 30, 2016: 

Unless the stockholder elects to receive
its distributions in cash, the Company intends to make such distributions in additional shares of the Company s common stock
under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of the Company s
common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, investors
participating in the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which
to pay any such applicable taxes. Any distributions reinvested through the issuance of shares through the Company s dividend
reinvestment plan will increase the Company s gross assets on which the base management fee and the incentive fee are determined
and paid to Stellus Capital. No new shares were issued in connection with the distributions made during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

NOTE 4      PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE  

In accordance with the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements and disclosures under U.S. GAAP, the Company discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements). The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows: 

STELLUS CAPITAL INVESTMENT
CORPORATION 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
September 30, 2016 
(Unaudited)  

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted prices in markets that are
not considered to be active or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices or valuations that require
inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The level of an asset or liability within
the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However,
the determination of what constitutes  observable  requires significant judgment by management. 

The Company considers whether the volume
and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifies transactions that are not orderly
in determining fair value. Accordingly, if the Company determines that either the volume and/or level of activity for an asset
or liability has significantly decreased (from normal conditions for that asset or liability) or price quotations or observable
inputs are not associated with orderly transactions, increased analysis and management judgment will be required to estimate fair
value. Valuation techniques such as an income approach might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market approach in those
circumstances. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
investments in 43 portfolio companies. The composition of our investments as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had

The Company s
investment portfolio may contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, which require the
Company to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying

      The Company calculates the price of the loan by discounting future cash flows, which include forecasted future LIBOR rates based on the published forward LIBOR curve at the valuation date, using an appropriate yield calculated as of the valuation date. This yield is calculated based on the loan s yield at the original investment and is adjusted as of the valuation date based on: changes in comparable credit spreads, changes in risk free interest rates (per swap rates), and changes in credit quality (via an estimated shadow rating). Significant movements in any of these factors would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. As an example, the  Range (Average)  for second lien debt instruments in the table above indicates that the change in the HY spreads between the date a loan closed and the valuation date ranged from -6.98% (-698 basis points) to 6.87% (687 basis points). The average of all changes was -0.05%.

      The primary significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity investments is the EBITDA multiple (the  Multiple ). Significant increases (decreases) in the Multiple in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. To determine the Multiple for the market approach, the Company considers current market trading and/or transaction multiple, portfolio company performance (financial ratios) relative to public and private peer companies and leverage levels, among other factors. Changes in one or more of these factors can have a similar directional change on other factors in determining the appropriate Multiple to use in the market approach.

NOTE 7   CREDIT FACILITY  

On November 7, 2012, the Company entered
into a revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with various lenders. SunTrust Bank, one of the lenders, serves
as administrative agent under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, as amended on November 21, 2014 and August 31, 2016, provides
for borrowings in an aggregate amount of $120,000,000 on a committed basis with an accordion feature that allows the Company to
increase the aggregate commitments up to $195,000,000, subject to new or existing lenders agreeing to participate in the increase
and other customary conditions. There can be no assurances that existing lenders will agree to such an increase, or that additional
lenders will join the Credit Facility to increase available borrowings. 

STELLUS CAPITAL INVESTMENT
CORPORATION 
  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
September 30, 2016 
(Unaudited)  

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest, subject to the Company s election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.625% with no LIBOR floor or (ii)
1.625% plus an alternate base rate based on the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or one month LIBOR plus
1.0%. The Company pays unused commitment fees of 0.50% per annum on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. Interest
is payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest
thereunder will be due and payable, on October 1, 2018. 

The Company s obligations to the lenders
are secured by a first priority security interest in its portfolio of securities and cash not held at the SBIC subsidiary, but
excluding short term investments. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited
to: (i) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least 85% of adjusted borrowing base, (ii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio
of at least 2.0 to 1.0, and (iii) maintaining a minimum shareholder s equity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires that the Company meet certain conditions in connection
with incurring additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility, including that the Company have a minimum asset coverage ratio
after giving effect to such borrowing. On August 31, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended to reduce asset coverage related to
additional indebtedness from 2.25 to 2.20 to 1.0, as long as certain conditions are met.  These conditions state that (i)
the aggregate amount of PIK interest during the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the borrower does not exceed 2% of the aggregate
amount of interest income that the borrower has received on all investments in the borrowing base during such fiscal quarter; (ii)
the sum of the value of all non-accrual investments does not exceed 5% of the value of all   investments
in the borrowing base and (iii) the borrower maintains a minimum liquidity test of at least 80% of adjusted borrowing base. As
of September 30, 2016, these conditions were met. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $107,500,000 and $109,500,000, respectively. The carrying amount of
the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility approximates its fair value. The Company incurred total costs of $3,067,715 in
connection with obtaining, amending, and maintaining the Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the life of the Credit
Facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $909,925 and $1,302,627 of such prepaid loan structure fees and administration
fees had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities
as a deduction from the debt liability attributable to the Credit Facility as required by ASU No. 2015-3. See Note 1 for further
discussion.

NOTE 8   NOTES  

On May 5, 2014, the Company closed a public
offering of $25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% notes (the  Notes ). The Notes mature on April 30, 2019,
and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option on or after April 30, 2016.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.50% per year payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, of each
year. The Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any
of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the Notes; effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under
our Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our
subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the SBIC subsidiary. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale
of the Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $24.1 million. The Company used all of the
net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility. On both September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Notes was approximately $25,000,000 and the fair value of the Notes was approximately
$25.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively. The Notes are listed on New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol  SCQ .
The fair value of the Notes is based on the closing price of the security, which is a Level 2 input under ASC 820 due to sufficient
trading volume. 

In connection with the issuance of the Notes,
we incurred $929,570 of fees which are being amortized over the term of the Notes, of which $481,815 remains to be amortized. These
financing costs are presented on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability as

the Exchange Act. 

NOTE 9   SBA DEBENTURES  

Due to the SBIC subsidiary s status
as a licensed SBIC, we have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the regulations
applicable to SBIC funds, an SBIC can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA subject to a regulatory leverage limit,
up to two times the amount of regulatory capital. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SBIC subsidiary had
$32.5 million in regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA. 

As a BDC, we are only allowed to employ leverage
to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. The
amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed
borrowing. 

On August 12, 2014, we obtained exemptive relief
from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiary guaranteed by the SBA from our 200% asset coverage test under
the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to
borrow up to $65 million (based on current regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA, of $32.5 million) more than
we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

On a stand-alone basis, the SBIC subsidiary
held $99,812,468 and $97,142,374 in assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which accounted for approximately
27.0% of our total consolidated assets at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have fixed
interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest
payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity, but may be pre-paid at
any time with no prepayment penalty. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SBIC subsidiary had $65,000,000 of
SBA Debentures (the  SBA Debentures ) outstanding, which mature ten years from issuance. The first maturity related
to the SBIC Debentures does not occur until 2025, and the remaining weighted average duration of all of our outstanding SBA-guaranteed
debentures is approximately 9.1 years as of September 30, 2016.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the carrying amount of the SBA Debentures approximated their fair value. The fair values of the SBA-guaranteed debentures are determined
in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the SBA Debentures
are estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance
risk, if any. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the SBA-guaranteed debentures would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined
in Note 4. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred
$2,226,250 in financing costs related to the SBA Debentures. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,739,957 and $1,984,154
of prepaid financing costs had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on the consolidated statement

Overview  

We were organized as a Maryland corporation
on May 18, 2012, and formally commenced operations on November 7, 2012. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return
to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in middle-market
companies. 

We are an externally managed, non-diversified,
closed-end investment management company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC )
under the 1940 Act. The Company s investment activities are managed by its investment advisor, Stellus Capital Management,
LLC ( Stellus Capital  or the  Advisor ). 

As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain
regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified
in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying
assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Under the relevant SEC rules, the term  eligible
portfolio company  includes private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national
securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange
and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the
United States. 

We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal
tax purposes as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  Code ). To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income
and asset diversification requirements. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we
generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. 

Portfolio Composition and Investment Activity  

Portfolio Composition   

We originate and invest primarily in privately-held
middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization)) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity
investment. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $352.7 million
(at fair value) invested in 43 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, our portfolio included approximately 32% of first
lien debt, 43% of second lien debt, 20% of mezzanine debt and 5% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments
at cost and fair value as of September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

As of December 31, 2015, we had $349.0 million
(at fair value) invested in 39 portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio included approximately 38% of first
lien debt, 38% of second lien debt, 20% of mezzanine debt and 4% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments
at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

The Company s investment portfolio may
contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, which require the Company to provide funding
when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying loan agreements. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had two and three such investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $2.5 million
and $3.3 million, respectively. 

The following is a summary of geographical concentration of
our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016:

investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016: 

The following is a summary of industry concentration of our
investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015: 

At September 30, 2016, our average portfolio
company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, and our largest
portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $22.5 million and $22.6 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2015, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $9.3 million
and $8.9 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately
$22.4 million and $21.4 million, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016, 76% of our debt investments
bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 24% bore interest at fixed rates. At
December 31, 2015, 75% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as
LIBOR, and 25% bore interest at fixed rates. 

The weighted average yield on all of our debt
investments that were on accrual status was approximately 11.1% as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The weighted
average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments that are on accrual status, including
accretion of original issue discount. The weighted average yield of our debt investments on accrual status is not the same as the
return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before
the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries  fees and expenses. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively. 

Investment Activity   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we made an aggregate of $37.4 million of investments in eight new portfolio companies and four existing portfolio companies.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received an aggregate of $35.6 million in proceeds from repayments of our investments,
including $4.1 million from amortization of certain investments. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had a receivable of
$3.6 million for the sale of our investment in the first lien term loan and equity of Blackhawk Mining, LLC. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, we made an aggregate of $85.1 million of investments in nine new portfolio companies and five existing portfolio companies.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received an aggregate of $76.3 million in proceeds from repayments and sales
of our investments, including $4.0 million from amortization of certain other investments. 

Our level of investment activity can vary substantially
from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital required by middle-market companies,
the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of
investments we make. 

Asset Quality  

In addition to various risk management and
monitoring tools, Stellus Capital uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected
level of returns on each investment in our investment portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale.
The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category: 

Investment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.   

Investment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2.   

Investment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants.   

Investment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.   

Investment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.    

Of the $9.8 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments
as of September 30, 2016, $12.5 million was attributable to company specific circumstances at portfolio companies with an investment
category rating of 5. Of the $15.2 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments as of December 31, 2015, $8.5 million
was attributable to company specific circumstances at portfolio companies with an investment category rating of 5. 

Loans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status   

We will not accrue interest on loans and debt
securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of September 30, 2016, we had one loan on non-accrual
status, which represented approximately 3.6% of our loan portfolio at cost and 0.2% at fair value. December 31, 2015, we had one
loan on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.6% of our loan portfolio at cost and 1.3% at fair value. 

Results of Operations  

An important measure of our financial performance
is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain
(loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest,
dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain
(loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized
cost, except for loans booked at a discount to account for origination fees. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments
is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. 

Comparison of the Three Months and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues  

We generate revenue in the form of interest
income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio
companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest
on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the
stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may
pay payment in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest
will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing
investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and
any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue
in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees. 

The following shows the breakdown of investment
income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions). 

The increases in total income from
the respective periods were due to the growth in the overall investment portfolio as well as prepayment premiums from the
early repayment of certain investments. In addition, unamortized loan origination fees of $0.3 million and $0.4 million
were recorded as interest income upon prepayment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.1
million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Expenses  

Our primary operating expenses include the
payment of fees to Stellus Capital under the investment advisory agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the
administration agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations
and transactions, which may include: 

organization and offering;   

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);   

fees and expenses payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;   

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;   

offerings of our common stock and other securities;   

base management and incentive fees;   

administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the administration agreement (including our allocable portion of Stellus Capital s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);   

transfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;   

U.S. federal and state registration fees;   

all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;   

U.S. federal, state and local taxes;   

independent directors  fees and expenses;   

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;   

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;   

costs and fees associated with any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;   

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;   

proxy voting expenses; and   

all other expenses incurred by us or Stellus Capital in connection with administering our business.   

The following shows the breakdown of operating
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions). 

The increase in operating expenses for the
respective periods was primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by the issuance of $39.0 million in SBA-guaranteed
debentures since September 30, 2015 and the increase in management and incentive fees attributable to our growing portfolio. Additionally,
the Company incurred $0.2 million related to the one-time expense of previously capitalized deferred offering costs during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net Investment Income  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
net investment income was $4.6 million, or $0.37 per common share (based on 12,479,958 weighted-average common shares outstanding
at September 30, 2016). 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
net investment income was $3.8 million, or $0.31 per common share (based on 12,479,962 weighted-average common shares outstanding
at September 30, 2015). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net investment income was $12.7 million, or $1.01 per common share (based on 12,479,959 weighted-average common shares outstanding
at September 30, 2016). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
net investment income was $11.7 million, or $0.93 per common share (based on 12,479,962 weighted-average common shares outstanding
at September 30, 2015). 

Net Realized Gains and Losses  

We measure realized gains or losses by the
difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific
identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. 

Repayments and sales of investments and
amortization of other certain investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $23.2 million, including $3.6
million of receivable for the sale of one investment, and net realized losses totaled $0.9 million. 

Repayments and sales of investments and amortization
of other certain investments for the three months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $22.3 million and net realized gains totaled
$2 thousand. 

Repayments and sales of investments and
amortization of other certain investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $39.2 million, including $3.6
million of receivable for the sale of investments and net realized losses totaled $0.9 million. 

Repayments and sales of investments and amortization
of other certain investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $76.3 million and net realized gains totaled
$0.3 million. 

Net Change in Unrealized Depreciation of Investments  

Net change in unrealized depreciation primarily
reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation
or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)
on investments and cash equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $6.2 million and ($4.6) million,
respectively. 

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)
on investments and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $5.4 million and ($3.2) million,
respectively. 

The increase in the change in unrealized
appreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to general tightening of
market interest rate spreads. The increase in the change in unrealized depreciation for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was due primarily to additional depreciation on our one non-accrual loan and additional depreciation due to
general widening of market interest rate spreads. 

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $9.9 million, or $0.80 per common share (based on 12,479,958 weighted-average
common shares outstanding at September 30, 2016). 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
net decrease in net assets resulting from operations totaled ($0.6) million, or ($0.05) per common share (based on 12,479,962 weighted-average
common shares outstanding at September 30, 2015). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $17.5 million, or $1.40 per common share (based on 12,479,959 weighted-average
common shares outstanding at September 30, 2016). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $8.8 million, or $0.70 per common share (based on 12,479,962 weighted-average
common shares outstanding at September 30, 2015). 

The increase in net assets resulting from operations
was primarily the result of (i) an increase in net investment income and (ii) an increase in the net change in unrealized appreciation
of investments, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. 

Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources  

Cash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities   

Our operating activities provided net cash
of $12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily in connection with cash interest received and repayments
of our investments, much of which was offset by the purchase and origination of new portfolio investments. Our financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 used cash of $14.7 million due to distributions to stockholders and net repayments
of our Credit Facility during the period. 

Our operating activities provided cash of $3.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily in connection with cash interest received and repayments of our
investments, which exceeded the purchase and origination of new portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 provided cash of $0.7 million primarily related to net borrowings under the Credit Facility and the issuance
of SBA debentures, which was offset by distributions to stockholders. 

Our liquidity and capital resources are derived
from the Credit Facility, SBA-guaranteed debentures, the offering of securities and cash flows from operations, including investment
sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and
other operating expenses we incur, as well as the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. As discussed below,
we did not seek stockholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value
per share at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders; therefore, we do not currently have stockholder authorization. We may use,
and expect to continue to use, these capital resources as well as proceeds from turnover within our investment portfolio and from
public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment activities. 

Although we expect to fund the growth of our
investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future public and private equity offerings and issuances of senior securities
or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard,
if our common stock trades at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise
equity capital given that we cannot sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share unless our stockholders approve
such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations in connection therewith. On June 26, 2016, the approval granted
by shareholders which authorized us to sell shares equal to up to 25% of our outstanding common stock of our common stock below
the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings expired. We elected not to seek shareholder
approval to sell shares below net asset value in our 2016 proxy; however, we may seek such approval in the future. In addition,
we intend to distribute between 90% and 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable
to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make
additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings.
In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and,
if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value. 

Also, as a BDC, we generally are required to
meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior
securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 200%. This requirement limits
the amount that we may borrow. We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiary
guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 228% and 222%, respectively. At all times during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements. The amount of leverage
that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such
as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance
of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only
intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively. 

Credit Facility   

On November 7, 2012, the Company entered into
a revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with various lenders. SunTrust Bank, one of the lenders, serves
as administrative agent under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, as amended on November 21, 2014 and August 31, 2016, provides
for borrowings in an aggregate amount of $120.0 million on a committed basis with an accordion feature that allows the Company
to increase the aggregate commitments up to $195.0 million, subject to new or existing lenders agreeing to participate in the increase
and other customary conditions. There can be no assurances that existing lenders will agree to such an increase, or that additional
lenders will join the Credit Facility to increase available borrowings. 

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest,
subject to the Company s election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.625% with no LIBOR floor or (ii) 1.625%
plus an alternate base rate based on the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or one month LIBOR plus 1.0%.
The Company pays unused commitment fees of 0.50% per annum on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. Interest
is payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest
thereunder will be due and payable, on October 1, 2018. 

The Company s obligations to the lenders
are secured by a first priority security interest in its portfolio of securities and cash not held at the SBIC subsidiary, but
excluding short term investments. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited
to: (i) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least 85% of adjusted borrowing base, (ii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio
of at least 2.0 to 1.0, and (iii) maintaining a minimum shareholder s equity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires that the Company meet certain conditions in connection
with incurring additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility, including that the Company have a minimum asset coverage ratio
after giving effect to such borrowing. On August 31, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended to reduce asset coverage related to
additional indebtedness from 2.25 to 2.20 to 1.0, as long as certain conditions are met.  These conditions state that (i)
the aggregate amount of PIK interest during the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the borrower does not exceed 2% of the aggregate
amount of interest income that the borrower has received on all investments in the borrowing base during such fiscal quarter; (ii)
the sum of the value of all non-accrual investments does not exceed 5% of the value of all   investments
in the borrowing base and (iii) the borrower maintains a minimum liquidity test of at least 80% of adjusted borrowing base. As
of September 30, 2016, these conditions were met. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $107.5 million and $109.5 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the
amount outstanding under the Credit Facility approximates its fair value. The Company incurred total costs of $3.1 million in connection
with obtaining, amending, and maintaining the Credit Facility, are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.9 million and $1.3 million of such prepaid loan structure fees and administration
fees had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities
as a deduction from the debt liability attributable to our Credit Facility as required by ASU No. 2015-3. See Note 1 to our consolidated
financial statements for further discussion. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the weighted average effective interest rate under the Credit Facility was approximately 3.1% (approximately 3.7% including commitment
fees and other loan fees). Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the Credit Facility
of $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, of which $0.8 million was interest expense, $0.1 million was amortization
of loan fees paid on the Credit Facility, and the remainder related to commitment fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility
and loan administration fees. The Company paid $0.9 million in interest expense and unused commitment fees for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The average borrowings under the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $105.2
million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the weighted average effective interest rate under the Credit Facility was approximately 3.1% (approximately 3.7% including commitment
fees and other loan fees). Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the Credit Facility
of $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $2.5 million was interest expense, $0.4 million was amortization
of loan fees paid on the Credit Facility, and the remainder related to commitment fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility
and loan administration fees. The Company paid $2.6 million in interest expense and unused commitment fees for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The average borrowings under the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $107.0
million. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the weighted average effective interest rate under the Credit Facility was approximately 2.9% (approximately 3.5% including commitment
and other loan fees). Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the Credit Facility
of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, of which $0.7 million was interest expense, $0.1 million was amortization
of loan fees paid on the Credit Facility, and the remainder related to commitment fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility
and loan administration fees. The Company paid $0.8 million in interest expense and unused commitment fees for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The average borrowings under the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $101.9
million.

Notes Offering   

On May 5, 2014, the Company closed a public
offering of $25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% notes (the  Notes ). The Notes mature on April 30, 2019,
and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option on or after April 30, 2016.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.50% per year payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, of each
year. The Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any
of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the Notes; effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under
our Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our
subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the SBIC subsidiary. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale
of the Notes, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $24.1 million. The Company used all of the
net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility. On both September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Notes was approximately $25.0 million and the fair value of the Notes was approximately
$25.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively. The Notes are listed on New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol  SCQ .
The fair value of the Notes is based on the closing price of the security, which is a Level 2 input under ASC 820 due to sufficient
trading volume. 

In connection with the issuance of the Notes,
we incurred $0.9 million of fees which are being amortized over the term of the Notes, of which $0.5 million remains to be amortized.
These financing costs are presented on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability
as required by ASU No. 2015-3. See Note 1 for further discussion. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company incurred interest and fee expense on the Notes of $0.5 million, of which $0.4 million was interest expense and the
remainder was amortization of loan fees paid on the Notes and administration fees. The Company paid $0.4 million in interest expense
on the Notes during the period. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company incurred interest and fee expense on the Notes of $1.4 million, of which $1.2 million was interest expense and the
remainder was amortization of loan fees paid on the Notes and administration fees. The Company paid $1.2 million in interest expense
on the Notes during the period. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the Company incurred interest and fee expense on the Notes of $0.4 million, of which $0.4 million was interest expense and the
remainder was amortization of loan fees paid on the Notes and administration fees. The Company paid $0.4 million in interest expense
on the Notes during the period. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
the Company incurred interest and fee expense on the Notes of $1.4 million, of which $1.2 million was interest expense and the
remainder was amortization of loan fees paid on the Notes and administration fees. The Company paid $1.2 million in interest expense
on the Notes during the period. 

The indenture and supplements thereto relating
to the Notes contain certain covenants, including but not limited to (i) a requirement that the Company comply with the asset coverage
requirements of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, and (ii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders
of the notes and the trustee under the indenture if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

SBA Debentures   

Due to the SBIC subsidiary s status
as a licensed SBIC, we have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the regulations
applicable to SBIC funds, an SBIC can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA subject to a regulatory leverage limit,
up to two times the amount of regulatory capital. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SBIC subsidiary had
$32.5 million in regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA. 

As a BDC, we are only allowed to employ leverage
to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. The
amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed
borrowing. 

On August 12, 2014, we obtained exemptive relief
from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiary guaranteed by the SBA from our 200% asset coverage test under
the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to
borrow up to $65 million (based on current regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA, of $32.5 million) more than
we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

On a stand-alone basis, the SBIC subsidiary
held $99.8 million and $97.1 million in assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which accounted for approximately
27.0% of our total consolidated assets at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have fixed
interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest
payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity, but may be pre-paid at
any time with no prepayment penalty. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SBIC subsidiary had $65.0 million
of SBA-guaranteed debentures (the  SBA Debentures ) outstanding, which mature ten years from issuance. The first maturity
related to the SBA Debentures does not occur until 2025, and the remaining weighted average duration of all of our outstanding
SBA Debentures is approximately 9.1 years as of September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the carrying amount of the SBA Debentures approximated their fair value. The fair values of the SBA Debentures are determined in
accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the SBA Debentures
are estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance
risk, if any. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the SBA Debentures would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note
4 to our consolidated financial statements. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred
$2.2 million in financing costs related to the SBA Debentures. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1.7 million and
$2.0 million of prepaid financing costs had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on our consolidated
statement of assets and liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability as required by ASU No. 2015-3. See Note 1 for further
discussion. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the weighted average effective interest rate for the SBA Debentures was approximately 3.1% (approximately 3.6% including loan fees).
Interest is paid semi-annually. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the SBA Debentures of $0.6 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, of which $0.5 million was interest expense, and $0.1 million was amortization of loan fees. The
Company paid $0.9 million of interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The average borrowings of SBA Debentures
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $65.0 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the weighted average effective interest rate for the SBA Debentures was approximately 2.8% (approximately 3.3% including loan fees).
Interest is paid semi-annually. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the SBA Debentures of $1.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, of which $1.4 million was interest expense, and $0.2 million was amortization of loan fees. The
Company paid $1.5 million of interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The average borrowings of SBA Debentures
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $65.0 million. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the weighted average effective interest rate for the SBA Debentures was approximately 2.2% (approximately 3.1% including loan fees).
Interest is paid semi-annually. The company recorded interest and fee expense on the SBA Debentures of $0.2 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, which represents both interest expense and amortization of loan fees. The company paid $0.2 million
of interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average borrowings of SBA Debentures for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 were $26.0 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
the weighted average effective interest rate for the SBA Debentures was approximately 2.1% (approximately 3.0% including loan fees).
Interest is paid semi-annually. The Company recorded interest and fee expense on the SBA Debentures of $0.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, of which $0.3 million was interest expense, and the remainder was amortization of loan fees. The
Company paid $0.3 million of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average borrowings of SBA Debentures
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $19.8 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We may be a party to financial instruments
with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of unfunded commitments to provide debt financing
to two and three of our portfolio companies totaling $2.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively. 

Regulated Investment Company Status and Dividends  

We have elected to be treated as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income
or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to
stockholders on a timely basis. 

Taxable income generally differs from net income
for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally
excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from
taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution
of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of
capital. 

To qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must,
among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company net taxable income (i.e.,
our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any).
If we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must also satisfy certain distribution requirements each calendar year in order to
avoid a federal excise tax on or undistributed earnings of a RIC. 

We intend to distribute to our stockholders
between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants
contained in the Credit Facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder
our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital
gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as
deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions
of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may
be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid
on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total
amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our
stockholders. 

We may not be able to achieve operating results
that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time.
In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to
us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in Credit Facility. We cannot assure stockholders
that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. 

In accordance with certain applicable Treasury
regulations and private letter rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock
as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either
cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must
be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing
to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any
stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other
requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount
of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock
in accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings.

Subsequent Events   

Investment Portfolio   

On October 11, 2016, we received full
repayment on the second lien term loan of NetMotion Wireless, Inc for proceeds of $10.2 million. Additionally, we received
proceeds of $1.0 million for the equity in Endpoint Security Holdings, LLC. 

On October 21, 2016, we made a $5.9
million investment in the second lien term loan of T.F. Hudgins, Inc. Additionally, we invested $0.25 million in the company s
equity. 

On October 24, 2016, we received
$3.5 million from the sale of Blackhawk Mining, LLC. which was sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

On November 1, 2016, we made a $9.0
million investment in the second lien term loan of Mobileum, Inc. Additionally, we invested $0.75 million in the company s
equity. 

Credit Facility   

The outstanding balance under the Credit Facility
as of November 2, 2016 was $100.3 million. 

Dividends Declared   

On October 7, 2016, the our board
of directors declared a regular monthly dividend for each of October 2016, November 2016 and December 2016 as follows: 

Item 3.   
         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

We are subject to financial market risks, including
changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 76% or 36 of the loans in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates. Of these
36 loans, 29 have interest rate floors that are higher than the current applicable LIBOR rate, effectively converting the loans
to fixed rate loans in the current interest rate environment. In the future, we expect other loans in our portfolio will be subject
to floating rates. Assuming that the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were to remain constant and no
actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, a hypothetical one percent increase in LIBOR would increase
our net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 by approximately $407 thousand and $1.2 million, respectively,
due the current floors in place. A hypothetical decrease in LIBOR would not affect our net income, again, due to the aforementioned
floors in place. Although we believe that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust
for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments
that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given
that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. We may hedge against interest
rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contacts subject to the requirements
of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability
to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not engage in hedging activities. Changes in interest rates will affect our cost of funding.
Our interest expense will be affected by changes in the published LIBOR rate in connection with the Credit Facility. As of September
30, 2016, we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements. At September 30, 2016, based on our applicable levels
of our Credit Facility, a 1% increase in interest rates would have decreased our net investment income by approximately $276 thousand
and $816 thousand, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Notes and SBA-guaranteed
debentures bear interest at a fixed rate per year and would not be impacted by changes in interest rates. 

Item 4.   
         Controls and Procedures    

(a)    
        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     

The Company s management, under the supervision
and with the participation of various members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this
report. 

(b)    
        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     

The Company s management did not identify
any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30,
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.

a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our
