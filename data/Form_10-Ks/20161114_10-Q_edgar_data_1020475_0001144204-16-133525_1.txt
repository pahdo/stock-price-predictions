CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Certain information included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q (this  Report ) or in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made
by us) contains or may contain forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate
to matters of strictly historical or factual nature and generally discuss or relate to estimates or other expectations regarding
future events. In some cases, forward-looking statements may contain terms such as  anticipates,   believes, 
 seeks,   could,   estimates,   expects,   intends,   may, 
 plans,   will,   potential,   predicts,   projects,   should, 
 would  and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements may include, but are
not limited to, information related to: anticipated operating results; relationships with our marketing partners and members; demand
for our website and changes in our membership ranks; financial resources and condition; changes in revenues; ability to create
revenue; changes in profitability; changes in accounting treatment; cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses;
interest expense; the ability to produce liquidity or enter into agreements to acquire the capital necessary to continue our operations
and take advantage of opportunities; legal proceedings and claims. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect
to future events and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described in the
section captioned  Risk Factors  contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as
filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

1. Description of Business   

Grandparents.com, Inc., together with its
consolidated subsidiaries (the  Company ), is a digitized media and eCommerce company that through its website, www.grandparents.com,
serves the age 50+ demographic market. The Company owns and operates the Grandparents.com website. As a membership organization
and social media community, it connects grandparents, seniors, and boomers to differentiated, discounted products and services.
Its services are geared to the approximately 72 million grandparents in the U.S., but its audience also includes  boomers 
and seniors that are not grandparents. The Company s website offers content on health, wellbeing, relationships and finances
as well as other topics that appeal to its audience. The Company believes that its website is one of the leading online communities
for its market and is one of the premier social media platforms targeting active, involved grandparents. The Company s business
model is to provide group discount benefits for a small membership fee. In addition to the website, the Company s membership
association, the American Grandparents Association (the  AGA ), was formed to unite grandparents, boomers and seniors.
The AGA is a resource for those seeking advice, information and discussion of issues important to grandparents. Members of the
AGA also enjoy access to its deals, discounts and products provided by third parties that the AGA endorses or recommends or makes
available to its members. 

2. Basis of Presentation   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Grandparents.com, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management,
are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods
are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or for any future periods. 

The preparation of condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States ( U.S. )
requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates,
including those related to revenue, the useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets including property and equipment and intangible
assets, fair values, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates of the carrying
value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. 

These condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 financial statements and related notes
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 28, 2016. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2015, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.  

3. Going Concern   

The Company incurred a net loss of approximately
$6.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $56.0 million and a stockholders 
deficit of $5.4 million at September 30, 2016. It has used approximately $4.4 million in cash for operating activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Without additional capital from existing or outside investors or further financing, the Company s
ability to continue to operate will be limited. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

On September 15, 2016, the Company sold
70,000,000 shares of its common stock for $1,050,000 and received an additional loan from its secured lender in the amount of $950,000.
The Company has an agreement to sell preferred stock for $1,000,000 and to receive additional loans from its secured lender up
to $2,000,000 which is contingent upon certain events including obtaining stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock to provide for the conversion feature of the preferred stock. 

Management plans to obtain resources for
the Company through raising additional capital through sales of its equity or debt securities. In addition, management is seeking
to expand its revenue streams and increase its endorsement opportunities. However, management cannot provide any assurances that
the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

4. Intangible Assets   

Intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived,
consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
additional costs of $52,080 were capitalized for further major enhancements of the website.  

Amortization expense related to intangible
assets amounted to $82,702 and $97,060 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $249,504 and $302,487
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The future amortization expense for the remaining three months
of 2016 and each of the four succeeding years related to intangible assets is estimated as follows: 

5. Notes Payable   

Notes payable and long-term loans, consisted
of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Accrued interest expense included in accrued
expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $202,746 and $185,687, respectively. 

Convertible Secured Loan   July
2015 Convertible Secured Loan  

On July 8, 2015, the Company and VB Funding,
LLC ( VB Lender ) entered into a credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) which provided for a multi-draw
term loan credit facility (the  VB Loan ) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $8,000,000. The full amount of the VB
Loan was advanced in two disbursements, with the initial amount of $5,000,000 (which includes the $1,000,000 amount previously
funded on May 18, 2015 pursuant to a bridge loan from VB Lender disbursed by VB Lender at the time of closing of the Credit Agreement.
The second disbursement was on December 31, 2015. The VB Loan was used to fund ongoing operations and to repay then outstanding
indebtedness. The Credit Agreement was replaced by an amended and restated credit agreement (the  Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement ) on September 15, 2016. 

Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the
Company was subject to certain customary limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments
and acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Credit Agreement contained
usual and customary events of default, the occurrence of which could have led to an acceleration of the Company s obligations
thereunder. 

Outstanding indebtedness under the VB Loan
could have been voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The indebtedness under the VB
Loan was due July 8, 2025 with interest at an aggregate of 7.5% per annum, 2.5% of which was payable in cash and 5.0% was payable
in-kind as additional principal. The VB Loan was secured by a security interest in the Company s and certain of its subsidiaries 
assets and each such subsidiary guaranteed the repayment of the VB Loan. VB Lender had the right to convert the outstanding balance
of the VB Loan into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price per share equal to $0.20 which gave rise to a
beneficial conversion feature having a relative fair market value of $1,950,000 as of July 8, 2015. This beneficial conversion
feature value was recorded as a discount to the VB Loan and was amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan. In connection
with the initial disbursement, VB Lender received a ten-year warrant to purchase 12.5 million shares of the Company s common
stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share. As of July 8, 2015, the warrant had a relative fair market value of $1,700,000 and
was recorded as a debt discount. In connection with the second disbursement, VB Lender received a ten-year warrant to purchase
7.5 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share. The warrant had a relative fair
market value of $465,146 and was recorded as a debt discount. There was no beneficial conversion feature in connection with the
second disbursement. 

Term Secured Loan   September
2016 Term Secured Loan  

On September 15, 2016, the Company and
VB Lender entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the Credit Agreement. The Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement has a principal balance equal to the outstanding balance under the VB Loan and provided for two additional
disbursements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,950,000 (collectively, the  New VB Loan ). The first disbursement
was advanced on September 15, 2016 in the amount of $950,000 and a second disbursement may be made in the amount of $2,000,000
when certain conditions are satisfied. 

Outstanding indebtedness under the New
VB Loan may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, prior to the maturity date. The indebtedness under the New VB Loan matures on October
1, 2031 and bears interest at the following rates per annum, payable in cash on a quarterly basis: 1% for the first year of the
New VB Loan, 2% for the second year, 3% for the third year, 12% for the fourth year and 15% thereafter. Interest is no longer payable
in-kind as additional principal on the New VB Loan. At September 30, 2016, outstanding indebtedness under the New VB Loan was $9,375,083
plus accrued interest of $47,543. 

The New VB Loan is secured by a security
interest in the Company s and certain of its subsidiaries  assets and the subsidiaries guaranteed the repayment of
the New VB Loan. The Company is subject to certain customary limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain
investments and acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default, the occurrence of which can lead to an acceleration of
the Company s obligation thereunder. 

The New VB Loan has no convertible feature
so it is not convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. 

In accordance with ASC 470-60 this refinancing
was considered a troubled debt restructuring with a modification of terms. As a result, the unamortized discount of $4,473,147
and unamortized debt issue costs of $275,885 from the VB Loan were carried forward to be amortized using the effective interest
method for the New VB Loan. On September 15, 2016, the Company also sold to VB Lender 70,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock at a price per share of $0.015, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,050,000. Because the fair value on the date
of purchase was $2,100,000, the difference of $1,050,000 was recorded as an additional equity discount on the New VB Loan and will
be amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. Any new fees paid to third parties in connection
with the New VB Loan were expensed as required. 

The Company intends to use borrowings under
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to fund the operations of the Company and to pay fees and expenses relating to the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement and related transactions. 

The Company intends to use borrowings under

and Restated Credit Agreement and related transactions. 

Other Outstanding Indebtedness  

In addition to the New VB Loan described
above, we have certain unsecured indebtedness, primarily promissory notes outstanding in favor of Mr. Leber in the principal amount
of $78,543 (the  Leber Note ), Meadows Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by Dr. Cohen, a member of the Company s
board of directors, in the principal amount of $308,914 (the  Meadows Note ) and BJ Squared, LLC, an entity controlled
by Mr. Leber, in the principal amount of $612,500 ( BJ Squared Note ). Meadows Capital, LLC, has a 50% interest in
the BJ Squared Note. These promissory notes reflect indebtedness assumed by us in connection with a merger in February 2012. The
Meadows Note and the BJ Squared Note accrue interest at the rate of 5% per annum and mature upon the earlier of (i) the Company
having EBITDA of at least $2,500,000 as reflected on its quarterly or annual financial statements filed with the SEC, or (ii) the
Company closing a financing with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $10,000,000. On September 15, 2016, the Leber Note was
modified so that no interest accrues on the Leber Note after September 1, 2016 and it matures upon the Company achieving fiscal
year net income of at least $5,000,000. The Leber Note remains subordinate in right of payment to the Meadows Note and the New
VB Loan. 

Total interest expense charged to operations
amounted to $655,323 and $521,868 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

6. Stockholders  Equity   

Common Stock  

On September 15, 2016 the Company sold
to VB Lender 70,000,000 shares of its common stock, at a price per share of $0.015, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,050,000.
Because the fair value on the date of purchase was $2,100,000, the difference of $1,050,000 was recorded as equity discount on
the New VB Loan and will be amortized over the life of the New VB Loan using the effective interest method. 

Series C Redeemable Convertible
7.5% Preferred Stock  

On September 29, 2015, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the  Preferred Agreement ) with certain investors (the  Preferred Purchasers )
and raised gross proceeds of $1,750,000, including the conversion by Mel Harris, a member of the Company s board of directors,
security holder and advisor to the Company, of the $450,000 principal amount of his convertible promissory note. Under the terms
of the Preferred Agreement, the Preferred Purchasers purchased an aggregate amount of 875,000 shares of Series C Preferred
Stock at a $2.00 per share purchase price. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock has a stated value of $2.00 (the  Stated
Value ) and is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into ten (10) shares of the Company s common stock
(the  Conversion Shares ) at a conversion price of $0.20 per share (the  Conversion Price ), subject to
customary adjustments, which gave rise to a beneficial conversion feature. 

In addition, the Preferred Purchasers received
warrants (the  Preferred Warrants ) representing the right to acquire an aggregate of 4,375,000 shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share (the  Preferred Warrant Shares ), subject to customary adjustments,
for a period of ten (10) years from the date of issuance. Under certain circumstances, the holder of the Preferred Warrant may
elect to exercise the warrant through a cashless exercise. 

Under the Preferred Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the Conversion
Shares and Preferred Warrant Shares under certain conditions after notice from the Preferred Purchasers.  

Additionally, the Company granted piggyback
registration rights to the Preferred Purchasers in connection with the Conversion Shares and Preferred Warrant Shares on subsequent
registration statements filed by Company, subject to certain exceptions.   

Each share of Series C Preferred Stock
earns dividends at the rate of 7.5% of the Stated Value, 2.5% of which dividend is payable in cash, and 5.0% will be payable in
the form of Common Stock, on a quarterly basis, at $0.20 per share. Accrued dividends are recorded as a liability in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, cumulative unpaid dividends of $87,500 have been accrued for 437,500 shares
of common stock at $0.20 per share. Accrued and unpaid dividends do not bear interest. 

The Series C Preferred Stock has a liquidation
preference over common stock and voting rights equal to the number determined by dividing the Stated Value by the Conversion Price
then in effect. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock vote together with the holders of the Company s common stock as a single
class. 

The Company may redeem the Series C Preferred
Stock at any time, at a price equal to the Stated Value per share plus any unpaid dividends. Alternatively, upon the election of
the holder, the Company will convert shares of the Series C Preferred Stock into shares of the Company s common stock. In
addition, the Company is required to redeem all remaining Series C Preferred Stock on September 29, 2025, the tenth anniversary
of the original issue date. 

The gross proceeds of $1,750,000 received
were reduced by issuance costs incurred of $76,423 resulting in net proceeds of $1,673,577 for the Series C Preferred Stock. 

In accordance with ASC 480-10, the Company
classified the Series C Preferred Stock in temporary equity. The relative fair market value of the Preferred Warrants was $603,608
and the fair market value of the beneficial conversion feature was $855,031 totaling an aggregate discount of $1,458,639 which
was recorded to additional paid-in capital. The issuance costs and discount are amortized using the effective interest rate method
over 10 years. 

Series D Convertible 12% Preferred Stock  

Simultaneously with the entry into the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, the Company and VB Lender also entered into a securities purchase agreement which provides VB Lender with the
right to purchase a total of 1,500,000 shares of Series D Convertible 12% Preferred Stock ( Series D Preferred Stock )
for a total price of $1,000,000, convertible into an aggregate of 1,833,000,000 shares of common stock. The conditions to the closing
of the sale of shares of Series D Preferred Stock include approval by the shareholders of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation
to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 2,156,500,000 shares, and the filing of a Certificate of Designation,
Preferences and Rights of Series D Preferred Stock (the  Certificate ). The Certificate specifies that from and after
the date of the issuance of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock, dividends at the rate per annum of $0.08 per share (which represents
12% per annum) will accrue on such shares. Dividends will accrue from day to day and will be cumulative, provided, however, that
except as provided for in certain circumstances, dividends will only be payable when, as, and if declared by the board of directors
of the Company and the Company will be under no obligation to pay such accrued dividends. 

As an additional condition to closing,
VB Lender required that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the option to convert their shares of Series C Preferred
Stock into shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted rate of $0.05 per share.  Additionally, VB Lender required
as a condition to closing that all shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by directors, officers and executives of the Company
be converted into shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted rate of $0.05 per common share.  The Series C Preferred
Stock was issued in 2015 for $2.00 per preferred share, with an initial conversion price of $0.20 per common share.  This
option to convert therefore represents a discount of $0.15 per common share from the original conversion price and shall take effect
immediately following the effective date of the Certificate and the closing of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per common share
are computed by dividing net earnings (loss) per common share by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per common share are computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the sum of the weighted average number
of shares of common stock and the dilutive effect of securities that can be converted into common stock. 

Reconciliations of the weighted average shares outstanding for
basic and diluted earnings per common share are as follows: 

Dilutive securities consist of unexercised
stock options and warrants as well as the convertibility of the Series C Preferred Stock and accrued dividends. The inclusion of
such dilutive securities in the computation of earnings per share would have been anti-dilutive and have therefore been excluded.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the numbers of excluded dilutive securities were 114,677,086 and
102,581,823, respectively. 

7. Stock Based Compensation   

The Company adopted the Grandparents.com,
Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), which currently provides for 25,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock to be eligible for issuance to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors, and independent contractors
who provide services to the Company under the Plan. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company granted 2,000,000 options to purchase shares of common stock, which expire five or ten years from the date
of grant, under the Plan to two employees. The options had an exercise price of $0.30 per share, which was greater than the stock
price per share on the date of grant. 

A summary of stock option activity for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below: 

The compensation expense recognized for
Plan and non-Plan options awarded for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $98,283 and $438,172, respectively.
The compensation expense recognized for Plan and non-Plan options awarded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
was $551,741 and $1,413,067 respectively. Total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested equity-based compensation
arrangements was $188,066 as of September 30, 2016. That cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of
27 months. 

All options were excluded from diluted
EPS since the Company is in a loss position. 

8. Warrants   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company granted warrants to purchase 600,000 shares of common stock in connection with services to the Company. The
warrants had exercise prices of $0.30 per share and they expire five years from the date of grant. The exercise price per share
was greater than the stock price per share on the date of grant. The aggregate fair market value of the warrants issued was $40,820
which was recorded as an expense in the statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, 5,359,737 unvested warrants issued to Starr Indemnity   Liability Company were forfeited (see note 10). 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, 500,000 fully vested warrants were voluntarily forfeited by the holder per written request to the Company. 

A summary of warrant activity for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year-ended December 31, 2015 is presented below: 

All warrants were excluded from diluted
EPS since the Company is in a loss position. 

9. Income Taxes   

ASC 740-10  Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes  ( ASC 740-10 ) requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using
a  more-likely-than-not  approach. Management evaluates Company tax positions at each reporting date and has determined
that as of September 30, 2016, no accruals for uncertain tax positions are necessary. 

The Company provides for income taxes at
the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Cumulative adjustments to the
Company s estimate are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined. 

The difference between the federal statutory
rate (34%) and the Company s effective rate (0%) is primarily attributable to the change in valuation allowance on its deferred
tax assets as it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize its NOL s based on the Company s
current results and history of operating losses. 

Generally, the Company is no longer subject
to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2012. 

10. Commitments and Contingencies   

Operating Leases  

The Company leases an office in New York,
NY under an operating lease which expires September 30, 2018. The future minimum lease payments required under the office lease
as of September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

Rent expense recognized under operating
leases was $56,254 and $45,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $167,345 and $161,478
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Starr Agreement  

On January 8, 2013, the Company entered
into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the  Starr Agreement ), with Starr Indemnity   Liability Company ( Starr )
under which Starr agreed to provide certain services to the Company, including developing strategic business and investment relationships
for the Company and providing business consulting services to the Company. In exchange for the services, the Company agreed to
pay Starr a monthly fee of $80,000 during the term of the Starr Agreement, which commenced on March 1, 2013, as well as fees to
be agreed upon by the Company and Starr for Starr s arranging agreements with insurance companies. On March 1, 2014 and on
March 1, 2015, the Starr Agreement automatically renewed for one-year periods and was to automatically renew on March 1, 2016 unless
either party terminated the agreement prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The Starr Agreement was amended in April
2013 at which time the Company committed to issuing Starr a warrant to acquire up to 21,438,954 shares of our common stock, subject
to certain customary adjustments which was to vest one-fourth (1/4) of the warrant shares upon issuance and the remaining portion
of the warrant shares in three equal annual installments on March 1, 2014, 2015 and 2016, provided, however, that the warrant shall
automatically cease to vest upon termination or expiration of the Starr Agreement (see Note 8). On January 29, 2016, the Starr
Agreement was amended to extend the renewal deadline to March 29, 2016. On March 29, 2016, the Company decided not to renew the
Starr Agreement under its terms. As a result, the Starr Agreement is no longer in effect and the unvested warrants were forfeited. 

Cegedim Agreement  

Effective as of March 28, 2013, Grand Card,
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Alliance Agreement (the  Cegedim Agreement ) with Cegedim
Inc. (Opus Health Division) ( Cegedim ) pursuant to which the parties formed an exclusive strategic alliance (the  Alliance )
to develop member benefit programs (the  Programs ) that provide cash rebates and other rewards on the  Grand
Card  debit card. The Cegedim Agreement provides that all costs for marketing and promoting the Programs will be borne by
Grand Card LLC and that all other costs and funding of the Programs, subject to certain exceptions, shall be borne 75% by Grand
Card LLC and 25% by Cegedim. The Cegedim Agreement further provides that revenues derived from the Alliance (after deduction for
certain operating costs borne by the parties) shall be allocated 75% to Grand Card LLC and 25% to Cegedim. The term of the Cegedim
Agreement commenced on March 28, 2013 and will continue for an initial term of four (4) years and will automatically renew for
successive four-year terms unless fewer than 500,000 cards have been issued at the time of such renewal or either party provides
written notice to the other party of its intent not to renew within 120 days of the end of the then-current term. On April 1, 2015,
the Opus Health Division was sold by Cegedim Inc. to IMS Health Holdings, Inc. 

Vantiv Agreement  

In November 2014, Grand Card LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company and Vantiv, LLC ( Vantiv ) entered into a master services agreement, an Addendum and exhibits
thereto (collectively, the  Vantiv Agreement ) pursuant to which Vantiv agreed to provide card issuing and payment
processing products and services to Grand Card LLC. Pursuant to the Vantiv Agreement, Grand Card LLC has committed to, among other
things, a card purchasing allotment valued at $775,000 over a twelve (12) month period and in the first quarter of 2015, the Company
purchased the initial card commitment at an aggregate cost of $168,756 cards. The initial term of the Vantiv Agreement was three
years. On November 11, 2015, Vantiv and Grand Card LLC entered into an amendment to the Vantiv Agreement extending the date on
which a purchase order for the balance of the card allotment must be made to December 17, 2015. On December 18, 2015, Vantiv and
Grand Card LLC entered into another amendment to the Vantiv Agreement extending the date on which a purchase order for the balance
of the card allotment must be made to (i) a partial purchase order for one-third of the remaining balance to be made by December
22, 2015 and (ii) an additional purchase order for the remaining balance by March 31, 2016. On December 22, 2015, such order was
placed and in January 2016, the Company purchased additional cards for an aggregate cost of $202,050. On May 10, 2016, Vantiv and
Grand Card LLC entered into another amendment which was revised on May 17, 2016 to the Vantiv Agreement extending the schedule
of card purchases from July 1 through the end of 2016, extending the term of the Vantiv Agreement for two years and providing for
an additional 100,000 cards to be purchased for an aggregate cost of approximately $158,024. It is subject to standard termination
provisions as well as customary representations and warranties. In the event of a default under the Vantiv Agreement by Grand Card
LLC, Grand Card LLC may be responsible for liquidated damages in an amount based upon the monthly revenue earned by Vantiv for
the balance of the term. The Company s Grand Card venture is a cash rebate debit card that will enable cardholders to purchase
pharmaceutical products and consumer goods and services from participating merchants. Prior to September 30, 2016 all costs incurred
for purchasing cards from Vantiv in the amount of $794,243 had been fully capitalized as a prepaid expense with anticipated future
benefits from generating Grand Card revenues. As of September 30, 2016, these prepaid expenses were expensed and recorded as a
selling and marketing expense because the corresponding revenue has yet to be achieved. 

The Company intends to issue the Grand
Card through the AGA and other channels and earn various related fees including percentages of discounts and rebates. 

HSNi Agreement  

On March 19, 2015, the Company entered
into an agreement (the  HSN Agreement ) with HSNi, LLC and its affiliates ( HSN ) whereby HSN produced
and broadcast segments promoting the Company s membership group, the American Grandparents Association, as well as certain
products and services offered by third parties. The initial on air segments involved education regarding Medicare Supplemental,
Medicare Advantage, and Cancer and Heart Attack or Stroke health insurance policies offered by Aetna and its affiliates. Under
the HSN Agreement, the Company received a percentage of certain proceeds generated through the multimedia marketing campaign conducted
by the parties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $400,000 as commission revenue under the HSN Agreement.
The HSN Agreement expired on December 31, 2015. 

Other Commitments and Contingencies  

On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into
an agreement with a consultant who will provide sales-related services to the Company. In addition to fees for services, the Company
will issue warrants following each calendar year of the three-year term if certain performance milestones are achieved by the consultant.
No warrants were issued for products sold in 2015 or 2016 under this agreement. For every 10,000 Grandparent.com-endorsed products
sold in years 2016 and 2017 of the three-year term as a result of the consultant s efforts, the Company will grant warrants
to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.21 per share with a 5-year term. 

On May 4, 2016, DMI Partners, Inc. instituted
a suit against the Company in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County PA seeking damages of $158,677 plus interest of
$137,842 and costs and fees. The suit is for a breach of contract claim alleging nonpayment for services rendered in connection
with online marketing and sales lead generation. The Company has accrued the invoice amount of $158,677 in its accounts payable.
The Company has filed an answer and intends to vigorously defend all claims.

Item 2.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

In this Report, the terms  Company, 
 we,   us  and  our  refer to Grandparents.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context
otherwise requires. In addition, the term  Annual Report  refers to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016.  

The following discussion and analysis
is based on, should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes thereto included in this Report. The following discussion and analysis should also be read in conjunction
with the disclosure under  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  and the risk factors contained in
our Annual Report.  

Overview  

We own and operate the Grandparents.com
website. As a membership organization and social media community, we connect grandparents, seniors, and boomers to differentiated,
discounted products and services. Our services are geared to the approximately 72 million grandparents in the U.S., but our audience
also includes  boomers  and seniors that are not grandparents. Our website offers content on health, wellbeing, relationships
and finances as well as other topics that appeal to our audience. Our business model is to provide group discount benefits for
a small membership fee. We believe that our website is one of the leading online communities for our market and is the premier
social media platform targeting active, involved grandparents. 

In addition to our website, our membership
association, the American Grandparents Association (the  AGA ), was formed to unite grandparents, boomers and seniors.
Members of the AGA have access to a range of benefits including discounts on products and services. Members pay $15 annually to
the AGA to receive these benefits as well as products and services that are endorsed or recommended by the AGA. 

To date, most of our revenue has been from
advertising on our website. We have broadened our focus to create additional revenue streams by establishing additional products
and services and entering into various partnerships and joint ventures. As these products, services and partnerships continue to
be developed, implemented and marketed, we expect to generate additional revenue from these sources in the future. 

Like most developing companies, we face
substantial financial challenges particularly in regard to revenue generation, cost control and capital requirements. Revenue for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $255,979, which reflected a decrease of $126,646, or 33%, compared to revenue of $382,625
for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is mostly due to reduced placement fees by one vendor. The Company decreased its
total operating expenses by $839,799 or 12%, to $6,071,903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,911,702
for the comparable period in 2015 mainly as a result of a decrease in equity-based compensation expense offset by an increase in
selling and marketing expense. The Company decreased its net loss attributable to common shareholders by $382,609, or 5%, to $6,595,909
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6,978,518 for the comparable period in 2015. 

The Company used $4,429,428 in cash for operating activities
and received a net of $1,970,312 from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had a working
capital deficit of $2,218,702 as of September 30, 2016. It continues to seek additional capital and loans to fund ongoing operations.
Going forward, the Company will need to raise significant capital in order to successfully implement its business plans. See  Liquidity
and Capital Resources  below for additional information regarding our capital raising activities and use of cash. 

On September 15, 2016, the Company sold
70,000,000 shares of its common stock for $1,050,000 and received an additional loan from its secured lender in the amount of $950,000.
The Company has an agreement to sell preferred stock for $1,000,000 and to receive additional loans from its secured lender up
to $2,000,000 which is contingent upon certain events including obtaining stockholder approval to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock to provide for the conversion feature of the preferred stock. 

Without additional capital from existing
or outside investors or further financing, our ability to continue to implement our business plan will be limited. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to execute on our business model. 

Our Website   

Our website offers content on health and
wellbeing, relationships and finances as well as recipes, travel tips and recommended activities for grandparents, boomers and
seniors. We believe that our website is one of the leading online communities for our market and is one of the premier social media
platforms targeting active, involved grandparents. 

American Grandparents Association   

In addition to our website, our membership
association, the AGA was formed to unite grandparents, boomers and seniors. Members of the AGA have access to a range of benefits
including discounts on products and services. AGA members can access community features of the company s offerings including
discussions, blogs, games, and content as well as other products and services that are offered exclusively to AGA members. Members
pay $15 annually to the AGA to receive these benefits as well as discounts on products and services that are endorsed or recommended
by the AGA. There are approximately 1,830 members of the AGA and membership dues revenue of $15,144 was recorded in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. 

Grand Giveaways and Premium Membership   

Grand Giveaways offers free giveaways to
registered users of the website. Grand Giveaways consist of consumer goods and services in the areas of entertainment, food and
dining, health and wellness, children s entertainment and education products. We offer our promotional partners exposure
for their giveaways through various touch points: on our website, via our e-newsletter, and through social media channels. 

Premium Membership benefits are typically
discounted products and services provided by third parties appropriate for the 50+ demographic and their families. Premium Membership
benefits include deals and discounts on gifts, jewelry, toys, eyewear, flowers, travel, entertainment (theaters), pet supplies,
casinos, food and insurance. Many Premium Membership benefits providers have their promotions featured on our website. Premium
Members receive Grand Giveaways and the Premium Membership benefits for an annual fee of $15 and there are approximately 1,830
Premium Members. 

We seek to maintain direct relationships
with our promotion providers and regularly have discussions about potential new giveaways, deals, and additional ways they can
cross-promote the AGA. Each Grand Giveaway and Premium Membership benefit is subject to the terms provided by the promotion provider
which may seek to change, retract, or cancel any giveaway or deal offered in Grand Giveaways and Premium Membership benefits or
otherwise to registered users or AGA members. 

Royalty Arrangements   

We derive revenue by endorsing or recommending
products and services provided by third parties in return for royalty payments. We have an agreement (the  Aetna Royalty
Agreement ) with Aetna, pursuant to which Aetna will offer a group Medicare Supplement insurance policy to AGA members. On
June 4, 2015, Aetna added a Cancer, Heart Attack or Stroke policy as a product offered under the Aetna Royalty Agreement. In exchange
for our endorsement, a license to use our intellectual property and access to the AGA membership, Aetna will pay a royalty to the
Company. The Aetna Royalty Agreement requires Aetna to design, price and manage the insurance policies. We are not required to
perform any insurance producer services under the Aetna Royalty Agreement. Aetna continues to file its policy forms with various
state insurance departments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a royalty of $7,624 was earned and recorded in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations in advertising and other revenue. 

There can be no guarantee that we will
be able to earn additional revenue from the Aetna Royalty Agreement or enter into similar agreements or other royalty arrangements
with other third parties, or, if we are, the terms of such arrangements will be on terms advantageous to us. To the extent we are
able to enter into royalty arrangements, revenues, if any, from such arrangements may be limited in the near term. There can be
no guarantee the Company will derive revenue from this or any other royalty program. 

Commission Arrangements   

On October 29, 2014, a subsidiary of the
Company entered into an Aetna Marketing Agreement for Upline Agents and Agencies (the  MA Contract ) with Aetna to
offer a Medicare Advantage insurance policy pursuant to which such subsidiary will receive a commission for each such policy sold.
The MA Contract became effective January 1, 2015. 

Effective on October 31, 2014, a subsidiary
of the Company entered into an Aetna Marketing Agreement for Group Contracting Only (the  MS Contract ) with Aetna
to offer a Medicare Supplement insurance policy pursuant to which such subsidiary will receive a commission for each such policy
sold. 

On August 26, 2016, a subsidiary of the
Company, entered into an Aetna Marketing Agreement for Upline Licensed Agents and Agencies (the  2016 MA Contract )
with Aetna Life Insurance Company and certain affiliates ( Aetna ). Pursuant to the 2016 MA Contract, GIS will serve
as a general agent and offer Medicare Advantage and Part D policies to certain target customers pursuant to which such subsidiary
will receive a commission for each such policy sold. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, commissions pursuant to these arrangements and others of $12,888 was earned and recorded in the condensed consolidated statement
of operations in commission revenue. 

There can be no guarantee that we will
be able to earn additional revenue from the MA Contract, the MS Contract or the 2016 MA Contract or enter into similar agreements
or other commission arrangements with other third parties or, if we are, the terms of such arrangements will be on terms advantageous
to us. To the extent we are able to enter into commission arrangements, revenues, if any, from such arrangements may be limited
in the near term. There can be no guarantee the Company will derive revenue from this or any other commission program. 

Grand Card    

The Company has established a debit card
rewards program that bundles rebates and discounts on a debit card which are activated when cardholders purchase pharmaceutical
products and consumer goods and services offered by participating merchants (the  Grand Card ). We have formed an alliance
with Cegedim for the purposes of developing the Grand Card. Cegedim has developed proprietary processes and technologies which
will be customized and adapted to the Grand Card for rebate programs. 

Development of the Grand Card has been
ongoing; hence we have not generated any material revenue from this program as of the date of this report. We launched the Grand
Card in the third quarter of 2016. The Company intends to issue the Grand Card through the AGA and other channels and earn various
related fees including percentages of discounts and rebates. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to further develop
this concept or, that if we are able to do so, that we will be able to generate revenue from it. 

Strategic Partnerships   

The Company has entered into several strategic
partnerships which it believes will help generate future revenue. By entering into such arrangements, it seeks to leverage the
marketing ability, distribution networks, and knowledge of its partners to help it develop its business. 

In March 2013, the Company entered into
an agreement with Cegedim, Inc. (Opus Health Division), the U.S. subsidiary of Cegedim, S.A., forming an alliance for the purpose
of developing the Grand Card. On April 1, 2015, the Opus Health Division was sold by Cegedim Inc. to IMS Health Holdings, Inc.  

In November 2014, Grand Card LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company and Vantiv entered into a master services agreement, an Addendum and exhibits thereto pursuant to which
Vantiv agreed to provide card issuing and payment processing products and services to Grand Card. This agreement has been amended
multiple times. The Company s Grand Card venture is a cash rebate debit card that will enable cardholders to purchase pharmaceutical
products and consumer goods and services from participating merchants. 

In January 2013, the Company entered into
a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the  Starr Agreement ) with Starr Indemnity   Liability Company ( Starr ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Starr International Company, Inc., under which Starr agreed to provide certain services to us, including
developing strategic business and investment relationships and other business consulting services. On March 29, 2016, the Company
decided not to renew the Starr Agreement under its terms. 

On March 19, 2015, the Company entered
into an agreement (the  HSN Agreement ) with HSN, LLC and its affiliates ( HSN ) whereby HSN produced and
broadcast segments promoting the AGA, as well as certain products and services offered by third parties. The initial on air segments
involved education regarding Medicare Supplemental, Medicare Advantage, and Cancer and Heart Attack or Stroke health insurance
policies offered by Aetna and its affiliates. Under the HSN Agreement, the Company received a percentage of certain proceeds generated
through the multimedia marketing campaign conducted by the parties. During 2015, the Company recorded $400,000 as commission revenue
under the HSN Agreement. The HSN Agreement expired on December 31, 2015. 

On April 7, 2016, the Company entered into
an agreement with the Northeast Division of Marsh   McLennan Agency LLC ( Marsh ), pursuant to which Marsh will

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including, among others,
those affecting revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts, equity-based compensation, and the useful lives of tangible and intangible
assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. 

The Company has identified below some of
its accounting policies that it considers critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations.
For detailed information and discussion on its critical accounting policies and estimates, see its financial statements and the
accompanying notes included in this Report. Many of its estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance,
and as such are forward-looking in nature, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and
elsewhere in this Report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future
events or circumstances. See  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  contained in this Report. 

Included in its Annual Report, the Company identified four of
our accounting policies that it considers critical to its business operations and an understanding of its results of operations: 

revenue recognition;   

fair value measurements;   

equity-based compensation; and   

impairment of long-lived assets.   

The Company included in its Annual Report
a brief discussion of some of the judgments, estimates and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and
the specific dollar amounts reported on its financial statements. This is neither a complete list of all of its accounting policies,
nor does it include all the details surrounding the accounting policies it identified, and there are other accounting policies
that are significant to it. For detailed information and discussion on its critical accounting policies and estimates, see its
financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Report and in the Annual Report. Many of the Company s estimates
or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance, and as such are forward-looking in nature, and are subject
to many risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report and in our Annual Report. The Company
does not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances. See  Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  contained in this Report.

by $133,455 or 26% to $655,323 compared to $521,868 for the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to an increase the existence
of interest on the credit facility for one quarter in 2015 versus three quarters in 2016.  

Net loss attributable to common shareholder. 
Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,595,909, or $0.05 per basic and

decrease of $382,609, or 5%. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we had unrestricted
cash of $1,306,607. We do not have enough resources to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. We expect to finance
our operations over the next twelve months primarily through our existing cash and offerings of our equity or debt securities or
through bank financing. Our operations have not yet generated positive cash flows. To effectively implement our business plan,
we will need to obtain additional financing. If we obtain financing, we would expect to accelerate our business plan and increase
our advertising and marketing budget, hire additional staff members and increase our operations all of which we believe would result
in the generation of additional revenue and development of our business. We cannot be certain that financing will be available
at all or on acceptable terms. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing debt or equity securities or through bank
financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. If we are unable to raise funds when required or on acceptable
terms, we may have to significantly scale back, or discontinue, our operations. If we are unable to raise funds, the Company s
ability to continue to operate will be limited 

Capital Raising Efforts   

On July 8, 2015, the Company and VB Funding,
LLC ( VB Lender ) entered into a credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) which provided for a multi-draw
term loan credit facility (the  VB Loan ) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $8,000,000. The full amount of the
VB Loan was advanced in two disbursements, with the initial amount of $5,000,000 (which includes the $1,000,000 amount previously
funded on May 18, 2015 pursuant to a bridge loan from VB Lender disbursed by VB Lender at the time of closing of the Credit Agreement).
The second disbursement was on December 31, 2015. The VB Loan was used to fund ongoing operations and to repay then outstanding
indebtedness. The Credit Agreement was replaced by an amended and restated credit agreement (the  Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement ) on September 15, 2016. 

Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company
was subject to certain customary limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and acquisitions,
and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Credit Agreement contained usual and customary
events of default, the occurrence of which could have led to an acceleration of the Company s obligations thereunder. 

Outstanding indebtedness under the VB Loan
could have been voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The indebtedness under the VB
Loan was due July 8, 2025 with interest at an aggregate of 7.5% per annum, 2.5% of which was payable in cash and 5.0% was payable
in-kind as additional principal. The VB Loan was secured by a security interest in the Company s and certain of its subsidiaries 
assets and each such subsidiary guaranteed the repayment of the VB Loan. VB Lender had the right to convert the outstanding balance
of the VB Loan into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price per share equal to $0.20 which gave rise to a
beneficial conversion feature having a relative fair market value of $1,950,000 as of July 8, 2015. This beneficial conversion
feature value was recorded as a discount to the VB Loan and was amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan. In connection
with the initial disbursement, VB Lender received a ten-year warrant to purchase 12.5 million shares of the Company s common
stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share. As of July 8, 2015, the warrant had a relative fair market value of $1,700,000 and
was recorded as a debt discount. In connection with the second disbursement, VB Lender received a ten-year warrant to purchase
7.5 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share. The warrant had a relative fair
market value of $465,146 and was recorded as a debt discount. There was no beneficial conversion feature in connection with the
second disbursement. 

On September 15, 2015, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the  Preferred Agreement ) with certain investors (the  Preferred Purchasers )
and raised gross proceeds of $1,750,000, including the conversion by Mel Harris, a member of the Company s board of directors,
security holder and advisor to the Company, of $450,000 principal amount of his convertible promissory note issued on August 20,
2015. Each share of Series C Redeemable Convertible 7.5% Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Series C Preferred
Stock ) has a stated value of $2.00 (the  Stated Value ) and is convertible, at any time at the option of the
holder, into ten (10) shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.20 per share, subject to customary
adjustments. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock earns dividends at the rate of 7.5% of the Stated Value, 2.5% of which is payable
in cash, and 5.0% is payable in the form of common stock, on a quarterly basis, at $0.20 per share. In connection with this Preferred
Agreement, the Company issued a ten-year warrant to purchase an aggregate of 4,375,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $0.30 per share. 

On September 15, 2016, the Company and
VB Lender entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the Credit Agreement. The Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement has a principal balance equal to the outstanding balance under the VB Loan and provided for two additional
disbursements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,950,000 (collectively, the  New VB Loan ). The first disbursement
was advanced on September 15, 2016 in the amount of $950,000 and a second disbursement may be made in the amount of $2,000,000
when certain conditions are satisfied. 

Outstanding indebtedness under the New
VB Loan may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, prior to the maturity date. The indebtedness under the New VB Loan matures on October
1, 2031 and bears interest at the following rates per annum, payable in cash on a quarterly basis: 1% for the first year of the
New VB Loan, 2% for the second year, 3% for the third year, 12% for the fourth year and 15% thereafter. Interest is no longer payable
in-kind as additional principal on the New VB Loan. At September 30, 2016, outstanding indebtedness under the New VB Loan was $9,375,083
plus accrued interest of $47,543. 

The New VB Loan is secured by a security
interest in the Company s and certain of its subsidiaries  assets and the subsidiaries guaranteed the repayment of
the New VB Loan. The Company is subject to certain customary limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain
investments and acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default, the occurrence of which can lead to an acceleration of
the Company s obligation thereunder. 

The New VB Loan has no convertible feature
so it is not convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. 

In accordance with ASC 470-60 this refinancing
was considered a troubled debt restructuring with a modification of terms. As a result, the unamortized discount of $4,473,147
and unamortized debt issue costs of $275,885 from the VB Loan were carried forward to be amortized using the effective interest
method for the New VB Loan. On September 15, 2016, the Company also sold to VB Lender 70,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock at a price per share of $0.015, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,050,000. Because the fair value on the date
of purchase was $2,100,000, the difference of $1,050,000 was recorded as an additional equity discount on the New VB Loan and will
be amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. Any new fees paid to third parties in connection
with the New VB Loan were expensed as required. 

The Company intends to use borrowings
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to fund the operations of the Company and to pay fees and expenses relating to
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and related transactions. 

Simultaneously with the entry into the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, the Company and VB Lender also entered into a securities purchase agreement which provides VB Lender with the
right to purchase a total of 1,500,000 shares of Series D Convertible 12% Preferred Stock ( Series D Preferred Stock )
for a total price of $1,000,000, convertible into an aggregate of 1,833,000,000 shares of common stock. The conditions to the closing
of the sale of shares of Series D Preferred Stock include approval by the shareholders of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation
to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 2,156,500,000 shares and the filing of a Certificate of Designation,
Preferences and Rights of Series D Preferred Stock (the  Certificate ). The Certificate specifies that from and after
the date of the issuance of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock, dividends at the rate per annum of $0.08 per share (which represents
12% per annum) will accrue on such shares. Dividends will accrue from day to day and will be cumulative, provided, however, that
except as provided for in certain circumstances, dividends will only be payable when, as, and if declared by the board of directors
of the Company and the Company will be under no obligation to pay such accrued dividends. 

As an additional condition to closing,
VB Lender required that the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have the option to convert their shares of Series C Preferred
Stock into shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted rate of $0.05 per share.  Additionally, VB Lender, required
as a condition to closing that all shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by directors, officers and executives of the Company
be converted into shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted rate of $0.05 per common share.  The Series C Preferred
Stock was issued in 2015 for $2.00 per preferred share, with an initial conversion price of $0.20 per common share.  This
option to convert therefore represents a discount of $0.15 per common share from the original conversion price and shall take effect
immediately following the effective date of the Certificate and the closing of the Series D Preferred Stock. 

The Company continues to seek capital in
the form of equity or debt to fund its operations in the future. 

Outstanding Indebtedness   

In addition to the New VB Loan described
above, we have certain unsecured indebtedness, primarily promissory notes outstanding in favor of Mr. Leber in the principal amount
of $78,543 (the  Leber Note ), Meadows Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by Dr. Cohen, a member of the Company s
board of directors, in the principal amount of $308,914 (the  Meadows Note ) and BJ Squared, LLC, an entity controlled
by Mr. Leber, in the principal amount of $612,500 ( BJ Squared Note ). Meadows Capital, LLC, has a 50% interest in
the BJ Squared Note. These promissory notes reflect indebtedness assumed by us in connection with a merger in February 2012. The
Meadows Note and the BJ Squared Note accrue interest at the rate of 5% per annum and mature upon the earlier of (i) the Company
having EBITDA of at least $2,500,000 as reflected on its quarterly or annual financial statements filed with the SEC, or (ii) the
Company closing a financing with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $10,000,000. On September 15, 2016, the Leber Note was
modified so that no interest accrues on the Leber Note after September 1, 2016 and it matures upon the Company achieving fiscal
year net income of at least $5,000,000. The Leber Note remains subordinate in right of payment to the Meadows Note and the New
VB Loan.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

None. 

Item 3.          Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Smaller reporting companies are not required
to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 4.          Controls
and Procedures.  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive
officers and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements because
of error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.  

As of the end of the period covered by
this Report, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end
of the period covered by this Report due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material
weaknesses primarily consisted of the following: (i) we do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and
procedures; (ii) we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions; (iii) we do not have adequate staff
and supervision within our accounting function; and (iv) we lack a sufficient process for periodic financial reporting, including
timely preparation and review of financial reports and statements. 

A material weakness is a control deficiency,
or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As of the end of the period covered by
this Report, we have taken additional substantive steps to remediate the material weaknesses, including engaging an experienced
consultant who is both an accountant and lawyer and previously served as a divisional CFO with a major insurance company and various
other companies, an experienced consultant with significant SEC experience, and an assistant controller with 20 years  experience
in accounting, accounts payable, and accounts receivable. None the less, we have not yet remedied the material weaknesses as of
the time of this filing. We have begun the process of documenting our internal controls and procedures to ensure timely filing
of our periodic financial reports filed with the SEC. However, due to our size and nature, segregation of duties within our internal
control system may not always be possible or economically feasible.

6.1    Upline Compensation.  

a.    During the Term of this Agreement, Aetna will pay compensation
for all completed Sales, as described herein and as further detailed in Exhibit B. With respect to completed Sales made by Downline
Agent, Upline shall compensate the Downline Agent in accordance with the applicable Downline Contract. Upline agrees that if it
retains any fees from the compensation due a Downline Agent as consideration for Upline s administrative services, including
for those services set forth on Exhibit C, Upline shall fairly compensate the Downline Agent and only retain an amount that is
fair market value for Upline s services. Aetna may recoup, by means of an offset or otherwise, any compensation paid to
Upline that was not in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement or Aetna Requirements. 

b.     Downline Agent and Designated Agent Compensation .

for any Sales. Upline agrees that such compensation is subject to and shall comply with Laws (including CMS requirements related

payments on behalf of its Downline Agent(s) and their Designated Agents. Upline shall disclose to Aetna any compensation or performance
based compensation based on Sales as needed by Aetna or as required by Law for Aetna s reporting purposes. To the extent

c.     Aetna will pay compensation for completed Renewals in
accordance with the terms set forth in Exhibit B while this Agreement is in effect, and if the Agreement is terminated by a Party
without cause. However, in order to receive compensation for a Renewal, Upline must comply with the requirements set forth in
this Agreement, including all requirements in Exhibits B and C. In addition, if Upline or its Licensed Agents target (i) any of
Aetna s existing EGWP customer business, or (ii) target and move any of Aetna s existing group business to another
carrier or product, Aetna shall not pay any Renewals for any completed sales that are subject to completed Renewals. Further,
as a penalty for Upline moving any business from Aetna, Upline shall owe Aetna three (3) years of fees as set forth in Exhibit
B subsection A paragraph 2 for such customer based on the total number of EGWP Product Enrollees who were enrolled in such group
customer s product at the time it was terminated and moved . . 

d.    Following termination of this Agreement, if an EGWP Product
Enrollee or Target Customer contacts Upline or one of its Agents seeking advice on EGWP Products, Upline or Agent shall direct
such EGWP Product Enrollee or Target Customer to Aetna s customer service. Should Upline or Agent fail to do so, Aetna may,
in its sole discretion, terminate payment of compensation for Renewals applicable to such EGWP Product Enrollee. 

e.    Where Upline, Principal or Agent involved in a Sale ceases
to be Ready to Sell for any period during which compensation would be payable with respect to a Renewal (  Lapsed Period  )
compensation shall not be payable on such Renewal during the Lapsed Period. In the event Upline, Principal or Agent, as applicable,
subsequently becomes Ready to Sell to, no retroactive compensation shall be payable by Aetna, but Upline, Principal or Agent,
as applicable shall be eligible to earn compensation for Renewals again beginning the first day of the month following the end
of the Lapsed Period, however no Initial Fee (as defined in Exhibit B) shall be payable for new enrollments received after the
original effective date of a Target Customer s group EGWP Product policy. - 

6.2    Electronic Payment . In general, all compensation
due under this Agreement will be made by electronic fund transfer. Upline must execute all documents reasonably necessary for
Aetna to effectuate electronic fund transfers into Upline s bank account. Aetna may decline, in its sole discretion, to

6.3    Adjustment of Compensation . Aetna may adjust the
compensation in Exhibit B upon thirty (30) days  prior written notice to Upline, or sooner if there is a change in Laws
affecting such compensation. 

6.4    Compensation Paid in Error.  

6.4.1   In the event Aetna pays compensation to Upline due to error,
regardless of the Party responsible for the error, Aetna may collect such amount thereof directly from Upline, or offset any future
compensation owed to Upline, within twenty four (24) months of discovering the erroneous payment. Aetna shall provide Upline with
information supporting the amount of any offset taken pursuant to this provision. 

6.4.2   In the case of an underpayment, Aetna shall pay such amount
due to Upline; provided, however, that: Aetna is not required to pay any amount due to Upline if (a) in the case of an underpayment
or no payment, Upline does not notify Aetna of such underpayment within twenty four (24) months of the date of the underpayment
or (b), for a missing payment, Upline does not notify Aetna of the missing payment within twenty four (24) months of the Target
Customer s EGWP Product Enrollee s policy effective date. If Aetna has initiated a collection related to compensation
overpayment within the twenty four (24) month period described in the preceding section, then there shall be no time limit, subject
to State law, on Aetna s ability to pursue collections. The twenty four (24) month limitation on Aetna s ability to
recoup or offset erroneous compensation (as described in 6.4.1 above) shall not apply, and there shall be no time limitation on
Aetna s ability to recoup or offset amounts (i) in cases of fraud or violation of Laws by Upline or its Licensed Agents
or (ii) related to a determination by CMS that a person was improperly enrolled or not enrolled in an EGWP Product. In instances
where Upline or Agent was paid compensation that was in violation of Laws or which involved fraud, Aenta also shall have the right,
without time limitation, to offset any amounts due from Upline to Aetna under this Agreement against any amounts payable to Upline
under this Agreement or otherwise. These rights are in addition to any other rights or remedies Aetna may have under this Agreement
or otherwise. 

6.5    Termination of an EGWP Product . In accordance with
Laws, Aetna may terminate EGWP Product policies then in effect, and Aetna shall have the sole right at all times to reject any
applications for EGWP Products. Aetna shall recoup or offset any amounts owed to Aetna by Upline (including future compensation)
with respect to the time periods during which the EGWP Product policy was not in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, retroactive
terminations of an EGWP Product Enrollee s coverage under any EGWP Product policy shall comply with Laws and the applicable
terms and conditions of the coverage.

for an Initial EGWP Sale that is completed as defined in Exhibit B be paid to Upline on Sales made by anyone other than Upline
or its Agents. No payment shall be made for an EGWP Sale if Upline (or its Principal or Licensed Agent) is not the Agent of Record. 

6.7    Rapid Disenrollment . Unless otherwise permitted
by CMS guidance, if an EGWP Product Enrollee disenrolls or is disenrolled from an EGWP Product within three months of his or her
enrollment in an EGWP Product (a   Rapid Disenrollment  ), no compensation shall be paid by Aetna to Upline or
for that Sale. If compensation is paid by Aetna for a Sale, and a Rapid Disenrollment thereafter occurs, then Upline shall refund
such compensation paid by Aetna for each such enrollee. Aetna may deduct any compensation amounts paid to Upline for a Rapid Disenrollment
from amounts Aetna otherwise owes to Upline. In order to not be a Rapid Disenrollment, the newly enrolled EGWP Product Enrollee
must remain enrolled with Aetna into the fourth month, i.e., if the individual enrolled with Aetna on January 1, the individual
must still be enrolled with Aetna on April 1 of the same calendar year. An enrollment that occurs during the fourth quarter of
a calendar year is also not considered a Rapid Disenrollment if such individual remains enrolled through the end of the same calendar
year. In addition, no recoupment, chargeback, refund or deduction shall be made if CMS guidance permits payment of compensation
for such Rapid Disenrollment with respect to the period that the EGWP Product Enrollee was actually enrolled. 

6.8    EGWP Product Changes . In the event that an EGWP
Product Enrollee changes Aetna plans, compensation shall be payable (or not payable) in accordance with Exhibit Bas a Renewal. 

6.9    Offsets . At any time, either before or after the
termination of this Agreement, Aetna shall have the right to offset any amounts due from Upline to Aetna under this Agreement
or otherwise against any amounts payable to Upline or its Agents. Aetna may utilize debt collection services and/or agent accreditation
services for purposes of collecting debts of Agents or Upline, the costs of which shall be borne by Upline. These rights are in
addition to any other rights or remedies Aetna may have under this Agreement or otherwise. 

6.10    Suspension of Payments . Aetna may suspend payments
of any kind to Upline and its Agents if Upline fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, is the subject of or involved
in any Complaint, or fails to cooperate in Aetna s investigation of a Complaint. Aetna shall provide Upline and Agent with
notice of such suspension and such suspension shall remain in effect until the resolution of the issue that caused the suspension.
If this Agreement is terminated with cause by Aetna during a suspension of payments, Aetna will cease paying any unpaid and future
compensation both for Initial EGWP Sales and Renewals.

Party  ) to disclose Confidential Information (hereinafter defined) to the other party (  Receiving Party  ).
Receiving Party agrees that, except as required by Laws, neither it nor any of its employees or Licensed Agents will at any time,
either during or subsequent to the term of this Agreement, disclose to others, use, copy or permit to be copied, without the express
prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party agrees that any
such Confidential Information disclosed to it, its employees, or Licensed Agents shall be used only in connection with the legitimate
purposes of this Agreement (or a more limited purpose as specified in writing at the time of disclosure), shall be disclosed only
to those who have a need to know it, and shall be safeguarded with the same care normally afforded such confidential information
in the possession, custody or control of Receiving Party, provided, however, that such care shall be no less than reasonable care
necessary to safeguard the Confidential Information. Each party shall retain full ownership rights to its respective Confidential
Information and nothing herein shall be construed as granting a Receiving Party any rights or ownership interests in Confidential
Information shared by a Disclosing Party.

information has been omitted in places marked

(ii) is subsequently received by Receiving Party in good faith from a third party without breaching any confidentiality obligation
between the third party and Disclosing Party; or (iii) is required by Laws to be disclosed; provided, however, Receiving Party
shall notify Disclosing Party prior to disclosure of any Confidential Information as required by Laws so that Disclosing Party
may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and shall only disclose the minimum amount of Confidential Information
necessary to comply with Laws. 

The failure of either Party to comply with the provisions
of this Section 9.1 shall be a material breach of this Agreement. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained
in this Section 9.1 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Disclosing Party and that
any violation thereof would result in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. Accordingly, in the event of an actual or threatened

remedy or damages in addition to those remedies provided under this Agreement to protect the confidentiality of Disclosing Party s

AGREEMENT   

This agreement (  Agreement  ) is made and entered
into as of the 7th day of April, 2016 by and among Grandparents.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (  GPCM  ) and
Marsh   McLennan Agency LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation (  MMA  ) (individually   Party  
and collectively   Parties  ). 

INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE AND SCOPE   

GPCM and the Northeast Division of MMA ( MMA NE ) wish
to work together to explore, find and implement various insurance and insurance related products, solutions and programs, partnerships,
and business relationships in the senior, boomer and other markets. 

Initially, the parties will focus on offering the products listed
on   Schedule A   attached hereto (the   Products  ) on MMA s insurance benefits portal known
as MMA Marketlink and through referrals to other regions of MMA. 

GPCM is an organization and social media community that addresses
the senior market with a website, and various products and solutions for seniors and boomers including insurance solutions. GPCM
has a subsidiary named Grandparents Insurance Solutions LLC ( GIS ), which is a licensed insurance broker and permitted
to sell the Products in the states where such Products are approved for sale. 

MMA is a licensed insurance producer and is in the business of providing
insurance brokerage and other insurance-related services to clients and MMA is licensed to sell the Products in the states where
such Products are approved for sale. 

MMA offers insurance products to middle market companies and employers
including through MMA s Marketlink portal. 

GPCM and MMA desire to establish a framework pursuant to which MMA
NE would market Products to employer groups with employees 64 years and older for whom the Products are designed; 

The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions,
scope of work and responsibilities of the Parties associated with their collaboration and agree to the following terms and conditions. 

TERMS AND CONDITIONS   

1.     Obligations     

MMA NE will facilitate discussions between GPCM and the Trion division
of MMA regarding the inclusion of the Products on MMA Marketlink. MMA NE will use its reasonable efforts to offer the Products
to its employer group clients with a percentage of 64+ year olds and further may refer or otherwise encourage other regions of
MMA to offer the Products to their employer group clients having a similar profile. 

GPCM will provide MMA with access to the Products. GPCM will also
use its reasonable efforts to provide for MMA with the opportunity to offer Products to residents at Century Village in Florida. 

2.     Terms and Conditions Apply to the Projects

by signing a separately negotiated amendment to this Agreement. In the event an Amendment is signed, all the other unchanged terms
and conditions of this Agreement will remain in effect. 

4.     Commission-Sharing     

GPCM, through GIS, shall pay to MMA, 50% of net commissions received
by it for each Product sold by MMA pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. As used in this agreement,  net commissions 
shall mean gross commissions less all fees and expenses associated with a third party call center. Payment to MMA shall be made
within 60 days of GPCM s receipt of such commission from Aetna and payment is subject to the terms of that certain Program
Agreement entered into between Aetna Life Insurance Company (together with American Continental Insurance Company, Continental
Life Insurance Company of Brentwood, Tennessee and Aetna Health and Life Insurance Company) and GPCM, dated as of October 9, 2013;
that certain Marketing Agreement for Upline Agents and Agencies entered into between Aetna Life Insurance Company and GIS, dated

in Section 8(b).  

Each of the Parties shall bear their respective
expenses in fulfilling their respective responsibilities under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the cost and expenses
associated with a third party call center shall be shared equally before the payment of the net commissions referred to in Section
4 above. 

6.     Exclusive Arrangement      

MMA NE agrees that during the Term and one year thereafter, it,
and its employees and agents will promote, market and sell the Products exclusively, and will not market, promote and sell any
other Medicare product or any product that is competitive with any of the Products. It is acknowledged and agreed that this exclusivity
applies only to MMA s Northeast division and there is no intention to bind MMA as a whole or any other region or division
of MMA to this exclusivity. GPCM agrees that during the Term and one year thereafter, it, its employees and agents will not promote,
market and sell the Products to Aon or permit Aon to promote, market and sell the Products to Aon clients. 

7.     Relationship of Parties      

The Parties agree and acknowledge that each
is an independent contractor in performing its obligations under this Agreement. Neither Party shall have the power or authority
to bind, obligate, or commit the other Party, and shall not represent or hold him or herself out to have such power or authority.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to indicate that the Parties are affiliates, partners, joint venturers, co-owners,
employers, fiduciaries or otherwise participants in a partnership, joint or common undertaking. GPCM shall have no authority with
respect to any client of MMA to solicit, sell or offer Products, accept applications, quote rates, bill or collect premiums or
settle claims or do any other act or make any statement which purports to bind MMA without MMA s prior written consent.

its affiliates, and its and their respective current, future and former directors, officers, employees, representatives, successors,
and assigns (each an   Indemnified Party  ) from and against any and all judgments, settlements, awards, losses,
liabilities, penalties, interest claims (including taxes and all related interest and penalties incurred with respect thereto),
damages, deficiencies and costs (including, without limitation, attorney s fees and expenses and court costs) (collectively
  Losses  ) and any and all civil, criminal, administrative or investigative actions, proceedings, or claims
(a   Claim  ) arising out of, related to, or due to any breach of this Agreement, any negligent act or omission,
or willful misconduct by the Indemnifying Party or any of its employees, agents or representatives. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any Claim if such settlement involves (i) any form
of relief other than payment of money or involves any finding or admission of any violation of any law, regulation, order, or
rights of any person or has any adverse effect on any other Claims, or (ii) only the payment of money, unless it includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party of all liability on such Claim. In the event any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
in accordance with this Paragraph 13, and the Claim giving rise to such indemnification materially relates to the Indemnified
Party s business, then such 

Indemnified Party may, without the Indemnifying
Party s consent, assume exclusive control of the defense of such Claim (including, without limitation, retaining appropriate
counsel and/or settling or otherwise resolving the Claim in the sole discretion of the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to participate in the defense of such Claim unless requested to do so by the Indemnified Party. The
exercise by any Indemnified Party of its right to assume exclusive control of the defense of Claims pursuant to this Paragraph
13 shall not in any way alter or prejudice the rights of the Company and each Indemnified Party to the indemnity obligation owed
by such Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees of such counsel and for any Losses
incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any settlement or judgment related to such Claims. 

14.       Disputes .

American Arbitration Association then in effect. The determination of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding on the Company
and Consultant, and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator
shall not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages. Issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with
the United States federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration. Each party shall bear its own attorneys 
fees; the other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
If court proceedings to compel arbitration are necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings shall pay all
associated costs, expenses and attorneys  fees that the other party reasonably incurs. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Consultant
breaches or attempts to breach any of Consultant s obligations under Paragraphs 10, 11, 12 or 13 of this Agreement, Consultant
acknowledges that such a breach would irreparably damage the Company and its business. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies,
the Company is entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent relief enjoining Consultant to prevent such harm from a court and
the Company shall not be compelled to submit a dispute under Paragraphs 10, 11, 12 or 13 to arbitration. Consultant specifically
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, for this purpose, or if
that court is unable to exercise jurisdiction for any reason, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. Consultant waives Consultant s right to any claim of improper or inconvenient venue
or forum. 

Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement.

proceeding), and any investigation and/or defense of any claims asserted against the Company or its affiliates, which relates
to events occurring during the provision of Consultant s services for the Company and its affiliates as to which Consultant
may have relevant information (including but not limited to furnishing relevant information and materials to the Company or its
designee and/or providing testimony at depositions and at trial), provided that the Company shall reimburse Consultant for expenses
reasonably incurred in connection therewith and pay the Consultants fees for time expended.

of this Agreement shall be void. The Company may assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, at any time.
This Agreement shall be binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties to it and their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that all of Consultant s covenants and obligations
to the Company, as well as the rights of the Company hereunder, shall run in favor of and shall be enforceable by the Company
