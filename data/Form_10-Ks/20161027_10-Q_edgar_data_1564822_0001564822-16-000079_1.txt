1. Summary of Business Activities 
  Business Overview 
  Pinnacle Foods Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of high quality, branded convenience food products, the products and operations of which are managed and reported in   four   operating segments: (i) Birds Eye Frozen, (ii) Duncan Hines Grocery, (iii) Boulder Brands and (iv) Specialty Foods. The Company s United States retail frozen vegetables (  Birds Eye  ), frozen complete bagged meals (  Birds Eye Voila!  ), frozen seafood (  Van de Kamp s   and   Mrs. Paul s  ), plant-based protein frozen products (  gardein  ), full-calorie single-serve frozen dinners and entr es (  Hungry-Man  ), frozen breakfast (  Aunt Jemima  ), frozen and refrigerated bagels (  Lender s  ), and frozen pizza for one (  Celeste  ) are reported in the Birds Eye Frozen segment. The Company s baking mixes and frostings (  Duncan Hines  ), shelf-stable pickles (  Vlasic  ), liquid and dry-mix salad dressings (  Wish-Bone   and   Western  ), table syrups (  Mrs. Butterworth s   and   Log Cabin  ), canned meat (  Armour  ,   Nalley   and   Brooks  ), pie and pastry fillings (  Duncan Hines Comstock   and   Wilderness  ), barbecue sauces (  Open Pit  ) and Canadian operations other than   gardein   are reported in the Duncan Hines Grocery segment. The Boulder Brands segment is comprised of health and wellness brands including gluten-free products (  Udi's   and   Glutino)  , natural frozen meal offerings (  EVOL)  , refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads   (Smart Balance),   and plant-based refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads (  Earth Balance  ). The Specialty Foods segment consists of snack products (  Tim s Cascade   and   Snyder of Berlin  ) and the Company s food service and private label businesses, other than Boulder Brands and   gardein  .  
  History and Current Ownership 
  On April 2, 2007, the Company was acquired by, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Peak Holdings LLC ( Peak Holdings ), an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. ( Blackstone ). We refer to this merger transaction and related financing transactions as the Blackstone Transaction. As a result of the Blackstone Transaction, Blackstone owned, through Peak Holdings, approximately   98%   of the common stock of the Company.  
    
  As of the launch of our initial public offering on April 3, 2013 (the  IPO ), we were controlled by Blackstone. Effective September 12, 2014, as a result of Blackstone s reduced ownership in the Company, we no longer qualified as a  controlled company  under applicable New York Stock Exchange listing standards. On May 8, 2015, Blackstone sold their final   5,000,000   shares in an underwritten public offering. Upon completion of the offering, Blackstone no longer beneficially owned any of the Company's outstanding common stock.  

2.  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position as of   September 25, 2016  , the results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , and the cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  . The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  . 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In 2016, the Company changed the presentation of debt issuance costs in line with the guidance set forth by Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs". The Company now presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than as an asset.  Amortization of the costs continue to be reported as interest expense. The changes in presentation were applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  As of   December 27, 2015   the cumulative effect of these changes on the balance sheet were decreases of   $15.9 million   in Long-term debt as well as in Other assets, net.

3.  Acquisitions 
    
  The Company accounts for business combinations by using the acquisition method of accounting. The following acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with these standards. 
    
  Acquisition of Boulder Brands Inc. (the "Boulder acquisition") 
    
  On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired   100%   of the capital stock of Boulder Brands Inc. ("Boulder") which manufactures a portfolio of health and wellness brands, including   Udi's   and   Glutino   gluten-free products,   EVOL   natural frozen meal offerings,   Smart Balance   refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads and   Earth Balance   plant-based refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads. The Boulder acquisition expands the Company's presence in growing and complementary health and wellness categories and in the natural and organic retail channels. 
    
  The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The Company is in the process of completing the valuation of various assets and pre-acquisition contingencies and, therefore, the fair values set forth below are subject to adjustment upon finalizing the valuations. The amount of these potential adjustments could be significant.  
    
  The cost of the Boulder acquisition was   $1,001,419  , which included the repayment of debt. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the total cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

Based upon the preliminary allocation, the value assigned to intangible assets and goodwill totaled   $1,042.3 million  . The goodwill was generated primarily as a result of expected synergies to be achieved because of the Boulder acquisition.  Distributor relationships and customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis over   30   and   10   years, respectively. These useful lives are based on an attrition rate based on industry experience, which management believes is appropriate in the Company's circumstances.  The Company has also assigned   $539.6 million   to the value of the tradenames acquired, which is not subject to amortization but is reviewed annually for impairment.  Goodwill, which is also not subject to amortization, totaled   $450.7 million   (tax deductible

goodwill of   $21.7 million   resulted from the Boulder acquisition). The Boulder acquisition is reported in the Company's newly formed Boulder Brands operating segment. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 25, 2016  , the Boulder acquisition resulted in an additional   $344.4 million   of net sales and net earnings of   $0.6 million  , related to Boulder operations from January 15, 2016 to   September 25, 2016  , which included a   $10.4 million   charge related to the fair value step-up of inventories acquired and sold during the period,   $17.3 million   of restructuring costs, primarily severance and   $6.8 million   of acquisition costs described below. 
    
  In accordance with the requirements of the accounting for acquisitions, inventories obtained in the Boulder acquisition were required to be valued at fair value (net realizable value, which is defined as estimated selling prices less the sum of (a) costs of disposal and (b) a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquiring entity), which is   $10.4 million   higher than historical manufacturing costs.  Cost of products sold for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   includes pre-tax charges of   $10.4 million   related to the inventory acquired, which were subsequently sold.  
    
  The Boulder acquisition was financed through borrowings of   $550.0 million   in incremental term loans (the "Tranche I Term Loans") due 2023,   $350.0 million   of   5.875%   Senior Notes (the "5.875% Senior Notes) due 2024,   $118.3 million   of cash on hand, prior to transaction costs of   $6.8 million   and   $1.7 million   in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   and fiscal year ended December 27, 2015, respectively, and debt acquisition costs of   $24.0 million   and   $0.4 million   in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   and fiscal year ended December 27, 2015, respectively.  The debt acquisition costs, which included original issue discount are being amortized over the life of the associated debt using the effective interest method and are recorded in Long-Term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt and Interest Expense. Included in the acquisition costs of   $6.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   are   $6.1 million   of merger, acquisition and advisory fees and   $0.7 million   of other costs. The   $1.7 million   of transaction costs incurred in fiscal 2015 primarily relate to legal, accounting and other professional fees. The transaction costs are recorded in Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Pro forma Information 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the Company's consolidated results of operations as if Boulder had been acquired on December 29, 2014. These amounts adjusted Boulder's historical results to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to plant assets and intangible assets had been applied from December 29, 2014, together with the consequential tax effects. These adjustments also reflect the additional interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the purchase. The   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   pro forma earnings were adjusted to exclude the acquisition related and restructuring costs incurred and the nonrecurring expense related to the fair value inventory step-up adjustment. The   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015   pro forma earnings were adjusted to include these charges. The pro forma financial information presented below is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and borrowings undertaken to finance the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 2015.  
    
  Amounts in millions: 

Boulder Brands Restructuring 
    
  As a result of the Boulder acquisition, the Company expects to incur approximately   $18.0 million   of restructuring charges in 2016, primarily related to employee termination and retention benefits. Charges of   $0.6 million   and   $17.3 million   were incurred during the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , respectively and were recorded in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table summarizes total restructuring charges accrued as of   September 25, 2016  . These amounts are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accrued Liabilities. 

4. Fair Value Measurements 
  The authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 
           Level  1: 
    Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
              Level  2: 
    Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
              Level  3: 
    Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions. 
     The Company s financial assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurements and the required disclosures are as follows: 

The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk. 
    
  The valuations of these instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange forward curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments). The variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. To comply with the provisions of the authoritative guidance for fair value disclosure, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds,

mutual puts and guarantees. The Company had no fair value measurements based upon significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of   September 25, 2016   or   December 27, 2015  . 
    
  In addition to the instruments named above, the Company also makes fair value measurements in connection with its annual goodwill and tradename impairment testing. These measurements fall into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  

5. Other Expense (Income), net 
    
  Other Expense (Income), net 

Foreign exchange (gains) losses.   These represent foreign exchange (gains) losses from intra-entity loans resulting from the Company's November 2014 Garden Protein acquisition that are anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future. 

6. Equity-Based Compensation Expense and Earnings Per Share 
    
  Equity-based Compensation 
    
  The Company currently grants equity awards under the Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  Incentive Plan ). Equity-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of equity-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. As equity-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The authoritative guidance for equity-based compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  
  Expense Information 
  The following table summarizes equity-based compensation expense which was allocated as follows:

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
  (thousands, except share and per share amounts and where noted in millions) 

Amended and Restated 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
    
  The Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of up to   11,300,000   shares of the Company's common stock under (1) equity awards granted as a result of the conversion of unvested performance interest units ("PIU's") into restricted common stock of the Company, (2) stock options and other equity awards granted in connection with the completion of the IPO, and (3) awards granted by the Company under the Incentive Plan following the completion of the IPO.  Awards granted subsequent to the IPO include nonqualified stock options, non-vested shares and restricted stock units ("RSU's"), the majority of which vest in full   three years   from the date of grant. The Company also granted non-vested performance shares ("PS's") and grants performance share units ("PSU's"), both of which vest based on achievement of relative total shareholder return performance goals over a   three  -year performance period.   
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, as part of our ongoing equity compensation program and in connection with the hiring of our new Chief Executive Officer: 

During the third quarter of 2016, as part of our ongoing equity compensation program:

  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss for common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net earnings by weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period plus dilutive potential common shares, which are determined as follows: 

Dilutive potential common shares are calculated in accordance with the treasury stock method, which assumes that proceeds from the exercise of all warrants and options are used to repurchase common stock at market value. The amount of shares remaining after the proceeds are exhausted represents the potentially dilutive effect of the securities. For the   three and nine months   ended    September 25, 2016  , conversion of securities totaling   640,650   and   499,192  , respectively, into common share equivalents were excluded from this calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , conversion of securities totaling   354,423   and   353,992  , respectively, into common share equivalents were excluded from this calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

  Goodwill 
  Goodwill by segment is as follows: 

The authoritative guidance for business combinations requires that all business combinations be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting. The authoritative guidance for goodwill provides that goodwill will not be amortized, but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when events indicate. The Company completed its annual testing in the third quarter of 2016, which indicated no impairment. Other than the recently valued Boulder Brands reporting units, all reporting units tested had a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by at least   70%

Tradenames 
  Tradenames by segment are as follows: 

The authoritative guidance for indefinite-lived assets provides that indefinite-lived assets will not be amortized, but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when events indicate.  Upon completion of the annual testing in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded tradename impairments of    $7.3 million   on   Celeste  ,   $3.0 million   on   Aunt Jemima   and   $0.9 million   on   Snyder of Berlin  .   Celeste   and   Aunt Jemima   are reported in our Birds Eye Frozen segment and   Snyder of Berlin   is reported in the Specialty Foods segment. These charges were the result of the Company's reassessment of the long-term sales projections for the brands during our annual planning cycle which occurs during the third quarter each year. The total carrying value of the three tradenames as of September 25, 2016 is   $66.4 million  . 
    
  To estimate the fair value of our Tradenames we use the relief from royalty method, which utilizes forecasted discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value. The utilization of this method requires us to make significant assumptions including sales growth rates, implied royalty rates and discount rates. Other than the recently valued Boulder Brands tradenames, in the course of our testing, we identified an additional   three    tradenames which do not have a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by at least   15%  . The total carrying value of these tradenames as of September 25, 2016 is   $25.5 million  .

Amended Credit Agreement 
    
  To partially fund the Boulder acquisition, on January 15, 2016 as described in Note 3, Pinnacle Foods Finance LLC ("Pinnacle Foods Finance") entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) which provided for a   seven   year incremental term loan of   $550.0 million   (the  Tranche I Term Loans ). Other than with respect to interest rate, maturity and certain pricing protections, the Tranche I Term Loans have substantially the same terms as Pinnacle Foods Finance's Tranche G and H Term Loans. Refer to Note 10 in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016 for details. In connection with the Tranche I Term Loans, Pinnacle Foods Finance incurred   $2.7 million   of original issue discount and deferred financing fees of   $10.5 million  .  
  The Tranche I Term Loans bear interest at a floating rate and are maintained as base rate loans or as eurocurrency rate loans. Base rate loans bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin, as described in the Amended Credit Agreement. The base rate is defined as the highest of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) the eurocurrency rate that would be payable on such day for a eurocurrency rate loan with a one-month interest period plus   1.00%  . Eurocurrency rate loans bear interest at the adjusted eurocurrency rate plus the applicable eurocurrency rate margin, as described in the Amended Credit Agreement. The eurocurrency rate is determined by reference to the British Bankers Association "BBA" LIBOR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. With respect to Tranche I Term Loans , the eurocurrency rate shall be no less than   0.00%   per annum and the base rate shall be no less than   1.00%   per annum. The interest rate margin for Tranche I Term Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement is   1.75%  , in the case of the base rate loans and   2.75%  , in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans.  
  On July 26, 2016, Pinnacle Foods Finance entered into amendments to the Amended Credit Agreement for the purpose of reducing the interest rate applicable to the Tranche I Term Loans (the  Repricing ). The eurocurrency rate was amended from a minimum of   0.75%   to a minimum of   0.0%  , the base rate was amended from a minimum of   1.75%   to   1.00%  , the interest rate margin in the case of Eurocurrency rate loans was amended from   3.00%   to   2.75%  , and the interest rate margin in the case of base rate loans was amended from   2.00%   to   1.75%  . All other terms and conditions of the Tranche I Term Loans remained the same. In connection with the Repricing, Pinnacle Foods Finance incurred approximately   $1.0 million   of fees and wrote off   $0.6 million   of existing debt acquisition costs. 
    
  As a result of the Boulder acquisition, Pinnacle Foods Finance's total net leverage ratio increased above   4.25  :1.0, which resulted in a 25 basis point interest rate step-up on existing Term Loans G and H, under the Amended Credit Agreement immediately subsequent to the quarterly certification to the Administrative Agent which occurred after filing the first quarter 10-Q report on April 28, 2016. The higher rate will remain in effect as long as the total net leverage ratio remains greater than   4.25  :1.0. As of   September 25, 2016  , the total net leverage ratio was   4.55  :1.0.    
  Senior Notes 
    
  To partially fund the Boulder acquisition, on January 15, 2016, as described in   Note 3  , Pinnacle Foods Finance issued   $350.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   Senior Notes (the "5.875% Senior Notes") due January 15, 2024. 
    
  The Company's   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the "4.875% Senior Notes") and   5.875%   Senior Notes (together the "Senior Notes") are general senior unsecured obligations of Pinnacle Foods Finance, effectively subordinated to all existing and future senior secured indebtedness of Pinnacle Foods Finance to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and

guaranteed on a full, unconditional, joint and several basis by Pinnacle Foods Finance s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other indebtedness of Pinnacle Foods Finance and by the Company. See   Note 17   for Guarantor and Nonguarantor Financial Statements. 
  Pinnacle Foods Finance may redeem some or all of the   5.875%   Senior Notes at any time prior to January 15, 2019 at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   5.875%   Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. The  Applicable Premium  is defined as the greater of (1)   1.0%   of the principal amount of such 5.875% Senior Notes and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such   5.875%   Senior Notes at January 15, 2019, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such   5.875%   Senior Notes through January 15, 2019 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate plus 50 basis points over (b) the principal amount of such 5.875% Senior Notes. 
  Pinnacle Foods Finance may redeem the   5.875%   Senior Notes at the redemption prices listed below, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on January 15th of each of the years indicated below: 

In addition, at any time prior to January 15, 2019, Pinnacle Foods Finance may redeem up to   35%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   5.875%   Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus a premium equal to 5.875%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of the   5.875%   Senior Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, with the net cash proceeds received by Pinnacle Foods Finance from one or more equity offerings; provided that (i) at least   50%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   5.875%   Senior Notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption and (ii) each such redemption occurs within   120 days   of the date of closing of each such equity offering.  
    
  Debt acquisition costs and original issue discounts 
  As discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, the Company now presents debt acquisition costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than as an asset.   
  As part of the Boulder acquisition, debt acquisition costs of   $21.5 million   and   $0.4 million   were incurred during the nine months  ended   September 25, 2016   and the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  , respectively. Additionally, original issue discounts of   $2.8 million   were incurred during the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   as a result of the acquisition. Further,   $0.6 million   of these costs were written off in July of 2016 in connection with the repricing of Term Loan I.  In addition,   $1.0 million   of debt acquisition costs were incurred as a result of the repricing.  
  All debt acquisition costs and original issue discounts are amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt using the effective interest method.  Amortization of these costs were $  2.3 million   and $  6.7 million   during the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , respectively.  Amortization of these costs were $  1.5 million   and $  4.4 million   during the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , respectively.

The Company maintains a defined benefit plan, the Pinnacle Foods Group LLC Pension Plan (the "Plan"), which is frozen for future benefit accruals. The Company also has   three   401(k) plans,   three   non-qualified supplemental savings plans and the Company participates in a multi-employer defined benefit plan. 
    
  Pinnacle Foods Group LLC Pension Plan 
  The Plan covers eligible employees and provides benefits generally based on years of service and employees  compensation. The Plan is frozen for future benefits and is funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations. The Plan assets consist principally of cash equivalents, equity and fixed income common collective trusts. The Plan assets do not include any of the Company s equity or debt securities. 
  The following represents the components of net periodic (benefit) cost: 

Cash Flows 
  Contributions.   In   fiscal 2016  , the Company does not expect to make any significant contributions to the Plan.  The Company made contributions to the Plan totaling   $3.1 million   in   fiscal 2015  , of which   $1.1 million   and   $2.8 million   was made in the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  . 
  Multi-employer Plans 
    
  The Company contributes to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Industry Pension Fund (EIN 51-6055922) (the "UFCW Plan") under the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement with its Fort Madison employees.  
    
  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , contributions to the UFCW Plan were   $180   and   $544  .  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , contributions to the UFCW Plan were   $186   and   $570  , respectively. The contributions to this UFCW Plan are paid monthly based upon the number of employees. They represent less than   5%   of the total contributions received by this UFCW Plan using available information during the most recent plan year.  
    
  The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: (a) assets contributed to a multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (b) if a participating employer stops contributing to the multi-employer plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers and (c) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the plan, the Company may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.  
    
  The UFCW Plan received a Pension Protection Act  green  zone status for the plan year ending June 30, 2015. The zone status is based on information the Company received from the UFCW Plan and is certified by the UFCW Plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the "green" zone are   at least 80 percent   funded. The UFCW Plan did not utilize any extended amortization provisions that affect its placement in the "  green  " zone. The UFCW Plan has never been required to implement a funding improvement plan nor is one pending at this time.

12. Financial Instruments 
    
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. 
  The Company manages interest rate risk based on the varying circumstances of anticipated borrowings and existing variable and fixed rate debt, including the Company s revolving credit facility.  Examples of interest rate management strategies include capping interest rates using targeted interest cost benchmarks, hedging portions of the total amount of debt, or hedging a period of months and not always hedging to maturity, and at other times locking in rates to fix interests costs. 
  Certain parts of the Company s foreign operations in Canada expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company s goal is to reduce its exposure to such foreign exchange risks on its foreign currency cash flows and fair value fluctuations on recognized foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and unrecognized firm commitments to acceptable levels primarily through the use of foreign exchange-related derivative financial instruments. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency.  The Company does not enter into these transactions for non-hedging purposes. 
  The Company purchases raw materials in quantities expected to be used in a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business. The Company generally enters into agreements for either spot market delivery or forward delivery. The prices paid in the forward delivery contracts are generally fixed, but may also be variable within a capped or collared price range. Forward derivative contracts on certain commodities are entered into to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in the Company s manufacturing processes. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt.   
  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company had the following interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk: 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCL in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. Amounts reported in AOCL related to derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional   $9,654   will be reclassified as an increase to Interest expense.

Cash Flow Hedges of Foreign Exchange Risk 
  The Company s operations in Canada expose the Company to changes in the U.S. Dollar   Canadian Dollar ("USD-CAD") foreign exchange rate. From time to time, the Company s Canadian subsidiary purchases inventory denominated in U.S. Dollars ("USD"), a currency other than its functional currency. The subsidiary sells that inventory in Canadian dollars ("CAD"). The subsidiary uses currency forward and collar agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the USD-CAD exchange rate. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the USD-CAD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. Currency collar agreements involve the sale of CAD currency in exchange for receiving USD if exchange rates rise above an agreed upon rate and purchase of USD currency in exchange for paying CAD currency if exchange rates fall below an agreed upon rate at specified dates. 
  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company had the following foreign currency exchange contracts (in aggregate) that were designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk: 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in AOCL in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the derivative, as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, are recognized directly in Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Non-designated Hedges of Commodity Risk 
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to commodity price risk but do not meet the authoritative guidance for hedge accounting. From time to time, the Company enters into commodity forward contracts to fix the price of diesel fuel, heating oil, natural gas and soybean oil purchases and other commodities at a future delivery date. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in Cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company had the following derivative instruments that were not designated in qualifying hedging relationships:

Credit risk-related contingent features 
  The Company has agreements with certain counterparties that contain a provision whereby the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company s default on the indebtedness. As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached this provision at   September 25, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value, which differs from the recorded fair value. The table below summarizes the aggregate fair values of those derivatives that contain credit risk-related contingent features as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  .

No single item individually is, nor are all of them in the aggregate, material. 

14. Segments 
    
  The Company is a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of high quality, branded food products in North America. Subsequent to the Boulder acquisition, the Company manages the business in   four   operating segments: Birds Eye Frozen, Duncan Hines Grocery, Boulder Brands and Specialty Foods. 
    
  The Birds Eye Frozen segment is comprised of our Leadership Brands in the retail frozen vegetables (  Birds Eye  ), frozen complete bagged meals (  Birds Eye Voila!  ), plant-based protein frozen products (  gardein  ) and frozen prepared seafood (  Van de Kamp s   and   Mrs. Paul s  ) categories, as well as our Foundation Brands in the full-calorie single-serve frozen dinners and entr es (  Hungry-Man  ), frozen pancakes / waffles / French Toast (  Aunt Jemima  ), frozen and refrigerated bagels (  Lender s  ) and frozen pizza for one (  Celeste  ) categories. 
    
  The Duncan Hines Grocery segment is comprised of our Leadership Brands in the baking mixes and frostings (  Duncan Hines  ), shelf-stable pickles (  Vlasic  ), liquid and dry-mix salad dressings (  Wish-Bone   and   Western  ), and table syrups (  Mrs. Butterworth s   and   Log Cabin  ) categories, and our Foundation Brands in the canned meat (  Armour, Nalley   and   Brooks  ), pie and pastry fillings (  Duncan Hines Comstock and Wilderness  ), and barbecue sauces (  Open Pit  ) categories as well as Canadian operations, excluding Garden Protein. 
    
  The Company refers to the sum of the Birds Eye Frozen segment and the Duncan Hines Grocery segment as the North America Retail business. 
    
  The Boulder Brands segment is comprised of health and wellness brands including gluten-free products (  Udi's   and   Glutino)  ,  natural frozen meal offerings (  EVOL)  , refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads (  Smart Balance),   and plant-based refrigerated and shelf-stable spreads (  Earth Balance  ).  
    
  The Specialty Foods segment consists of snack products (  Tim's Cascade   and   Snyder of Berlin  ), foodservice and private label business. 
    
  As the Company continues to integrate the Boulder Brands segment into its operations and financial reporting systems, the Company s management expects to reevaluate its internal reporting, which may require reporting of its results in different reportable segments in future periods. 
    
  Segment performance is evaluated by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker and is based on earnings before interest and taxes. Transfers between segments and geographic areas are recorded at cost plus markup or at market. Identifiable assets are those assets, including goodwill, which are identified with the operations in each segment or geographic region. Corporate assets consist of prepaid and deferred tax assets.  Unallocated corporate expenses consist of corporate overhead such as executive management, finance and legal functions.

               (3) 
    Includes new capital leases. 

15. Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes and related effective tax rates for the   three and nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively, were as follows: 

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between their financial statement basis and tax basis, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
    
  In connection with our acquisition of Boulder, our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 25, 2016 was increased by   3.7%   due to the tax effect of certain non-deductible acquisition costs and compensation payments, a charge for an increase in our non-current state deferred income tax liability balance and a charge related to the tax effect of foreign operations, principally attributable to a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credit carryforward.   Our income tax rate for the nine months September 27, 2015 reflects a     deferred tax benefit of   0.9%   for changes related to our state tax profile. 
    
  For the three months ended September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015 our rate reflects the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction and tax credits and the effect of enacted state tax legislation.  For the three months ended September 25, 2016 our tax effective tax rate also benefits from a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions. 
    
  The Company regularly evaluates its deferred tax assets for future realization.  A valuation allowance is established when the Company believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Changes in

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
  (thousands, except share and per share amounts and where noted in millions) 

valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company's tax provision in the period of change and as noted above, for the nine months ended September 25, 2016, a valuation allowance was recorded on our foreign tax credit carryforward in connection with our acquisition of Boulder Brands. There was   no   significant movement in our valuation allowances on state attribute carryforwards during the three and nine months ended September 25, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2015. 
    
  The Company is a loss corporation as defined by Internal Revenue Code ( the Code ) Section 382. Section 382 places an annual limitation on our ability to use our federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryovers and other attributes to reduce future taxable income.  As of   September 25, 2016  , we have federal NOL carryovers of   $439.4 million   subject to an annual limitation of   $17.1 million  .  As a result,   $237.2 million   of the carryovers exceed the estimated available Section 382 limitation.  The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets for this limitation. 
    
  On January 15, 2016 we acquired Boulder which is a loss corporation.  As of the acquisition date, Boulder had approximately   $50.8 million   of federal NOL carryovers subject to the Section 382 provisions.  The annual limitation is approximately   $26.5 million   subject to increase for recognized built in gains during the recognition period.  Based on our analysis, we anticipate we will be able to utilize the acquired NOL balance in our 2016 tax year without limitation.   
    
  In connection with our acquisition of Boulder we also recorded, in purchase accounting, reserves for uncertain positions of  approximately   $5.4 million   for matters related to their foreign operations.  

16.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU No. 2014-09 will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers using a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts with customers. This ASU can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective Date  providing for a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018; however, early adoption is still permissible as of January 1, 2017 for public entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations.  The amendments under this ASU clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations included within ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  This ASU includes updates which are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of applying guidance on identifying promised goods and services under Topic 606. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  This ASU clarifies several aspects of Topic 606 such as the assessment of collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements, as well as which transition method it will use. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". The areas for simplification in this ASU involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early application is permitted.  The amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  The amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows are to be applied retrospectively.  The amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement are to be applied prospectively.  The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance. 
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and creating Topic 842, Leases, which will supersede Topic 840, Leases.  The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  
  PINNACLE FOODS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
  (thousands, except share and per share amounts and where noted in millions) 

leases under previous GAAP.  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet.  The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted.  In transition to the new guidance, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts. The amendments will require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The new guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. Under the ASU, the adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the ASU should be applied prospectively. The Company has implemented this guidance in 2016 without material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory", which requires entities to measure most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable value,  thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM). The updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs". The new guidance changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company implemented this guidance in 2016.  Refer to   Note 2   for information. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04,  Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets". The new guidance gives an employer whose fiscal year-end does not coincide with a calendar month-end (e.g., an entity that has a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, as the Company does) the ability, as a practical expedient, to measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month- end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. The updated guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted, and the ASU should be applied prospectively. The Company implemented this guidance in 2015 without material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Business Drivers and Measures 
  In operating our business and monitoring its performance, we pay attention to trends in the food manufacturing industry and a number of performance measures and operational factors. The industry experiences volatility in overall commodity prices from time to time, which has historically been managed by increasing retail prices.  However, over the past several years, significant macroeconomic weakness and ongoing pressures on the consumer have resulted in shifting consumer buying patterns for grocery products.  As a result, industry volumes have come under pressure, hampering the ability of the industry to pass along higher input costs. 
  Industry Trends 
  Growth in our industry is driven primarily by population growth, changes in product selling prices and changes in consumption between out-of-home and in-home eating. In the current economic environment, consumers are looking for value alternatives, which have caused an increase in the percentage of products sold on promotion and a shift from traditional retail grocery to mass merchandisers, club stores and dollar store channels. We believe we are well positioned in grocery and non-traditional channels, maintaining strong customer relationships across key retailers in each segment.

     Table of Contents  

In order to maintain and grow our business, we must successfully react to, and offer products that respond to, evolving consumer needs, such as changing health trends, the focus on convenience and the growth of smaller households. Incremental growth in the industry is principally driven by product and packaging innovation. 
    
  Revenue Factors 
    
  Our net sales are driven principally by the following factors: 
             
    Gross sales  , which change as a function of changes in volume and list price; and  
                
    the costs that we deduct from gross sales to arrive at net sales, which consist of:  
                
    Cash discounts, returns and other allowances  .  
                
    Trade marketing expenses  , which include the cost of temporary price reductions ( on sale  prices), promotional displays and advertising space in store circulars.  
                
    New product introductory (slotting) expenses  , which are the costs of having certain retailers stock a new product, including amounts retailers charge for updating their warehousing systems, allocating shelf space and in-store systems set-up, among other things.  
                
    Consumer coupon redemption expenses  , which are costs from the redemption of coupons we circulate as part of our marketing efforts.  
     Cost Factors 

Costs recorded in Cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of operations include: 
                
    Raw materials,   such as vegetables and fruits, proteins, grains and oils, sugars, seafood and other agricultural products, among others, are available from numerous independent suppliers but are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, federal and state agricultural programs, export demand, weather conditions and insects, among others. 
                
    Packaging costs.   Our broad array of products entails significant costs for packaging and is subject to fluctuations in the price of steel, aluminum, glass jars, plastic bottles, corrugated fiberboard, and various poly-films. 
                
    Conversion costs,   which include all costs necessary to convert raw materials into finished product. Key components of this cost include direct labor, and plant overhead such as salaries, benefits, utilities and depreciation. 
                
    Freight and distribution.   We use a combination of common carriers and inter-modal rail to transport our products from our manufacturing facilities to distribution centers and to deliver products to our customers from both those centers and directly from our manufacturing plants. Our freight and distribution costs are influenced by fuel costs as well as capacity within the industry. 

Costs recorded in marketing and selling expenses in the consolidated statement of operations include: 
                
    Advertising and other marketing expenses.   These expenses represent advertising and other consumer and trade-oriented marketing programs.  
                
    Brokerage commissions and other overhead expenses  . 

Costs recorded in administrative and research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations include: 
                
    Administrative expenses.   These expenses consist of personnel and facility charges and also include third party professional and other services. Our lean, nimble structure and efficient internal processes have enabled us to consistently hold our overhead costs (i.e., selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding one-time items affecting comparability) to approximately 9% of net sales on an annual basis. 
                
    Research and Development.   These expenses consist of personnel and facility charges and include expenditures on new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products and processes. 
       
  Working Capital 
  Our working capital is primarily driven by accounts receivable and inventories, which fluctuate throughout the year due to seasonality in both sales and production. See  Seasonality  below. We will continue to focus on reducing our working capital requirements while simultaneously maintaining our customer service levels and fulfilling our production requirements. We have historically relied on internally generated cash flows and temporary borrowings under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our working capital requirements.

     Table of Contents  

Other Factors 
  Other factors that have influenced our results of operations and may do so in the future include: 

Interest Expense  . Our IPO and debt refinancings have improved our debt profile and significantly reduced our leverage. However, as a result of our previous acquisitions and the recent Boulder transaction, we still have significant indebtedness. Although we expect to continue to reduce our leverage over time, we expect interest expense to continue to be a significant component of our expenses.  
                
    Cash Taxes  . We had significant tax-deductible intangible asset amortization and federal and state NOLs, which resulted in minimal federal and state cash taxes through 2015. Continued amortization and utilization of our remaining NOLs will generate modest annual cash savings for 2016 and thereafter. 
                
    Acquisitions and Consolidations  . We believe we have the expertise to identify and integrate value-enhancing acquisitions to grow our business and we have done so successfully in the past. On November 14, 2014, we acquired Garden Protein for $156.5 million, the rapidly growing manufacturer of the plant-based protein brand   gardein  . On August 20, 2015 we acquired a manufacturing facility in Hagerstown, Maryland for approximately $8.0 million. The site will be used to expand production capabilities for the   gardein   brand and provide an East coast footprint to supplement the existing Richmond, British Columbia manufacturing location. We expect to invest approximately $31.0 million for the   gardein   capacity expansion in 2016. We also expect to incur approximately $6.0 million of additional charges to integrate the location in 2016, of which $2.5 million was incurred through the first nine months of 2016. As previously mentioned, on January 15, 2016, the Company acquired Boulder Brands for a cost of $1,001.4 million (which included $16.1 million of cash acquired), which included the repayment of debt. Total acquisition and financing costs of $32.9 million have been incurred, of which $2.1 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015, with the remainder in the first quarter of 2016. Included in this total is $24.4 million of debt acquisition costs, including original issue discount. During 2016, we expect one-time costs associated with the integration of Boulder to approximate $30.0 million, of which $27.9 million was incurred in the first nine months of 2016. 
                
    In October 2016, we voluntarily ceased production at our private label gluten free bakery operation, which is based in the United Kingdom. For the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , net sales were   $8.4 million   and the business incurred a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3.6 million. As part of the transaction, we may incur certain restructuring charges, to be determined in the fourth quarter of 2016. We do not expect these charges to be significant. 
                
    Impairment of Goodwill, Tradenames and Long-Lived Assets  . We test our goodwill and intangible assets annually or more frequently (if necessary) for impairment and have recorded impairment charges in the current year. Upon completion of the annual testing in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded tradename impairments of  $7.3 million on   Celeste  , $3.0 million on   Aunt Jemima   and $0.9 million on   Snyder of Berlin  .   Celeste   and   Aunt Jemima   are reported in our Birds Eye Frozen segment and   Snyder of Berlin   is reported in the Specialty Foods segment. These charges were the result of the Company's reassessment of the long-term sales projections for the brands during our annual planning cycle which occurs during the third quarter each year.  

Seasonality 
  Our sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality. Sales of frozen foods, including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals, tend to be marginally higher during the winter months. Seafood sales peak during Lent, in advance of the Easter holiday. Sales of pickles, relishes, barbecue sauces, potato chips and salad dressings tend to be higher in the spring and summer months, and demand for   Duncan Hines   products,   Birds Eye   vegetables and our pie and pastry fruit fillings tend to be higher around the Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas holidays. Since many of the raw materials we process under the   Birds Eye  ,   Vlasic, Duncan Hines Comstock and Wilderness   brands are agricultural crops, production of these products is predominantly seasonal, occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops. We also increase our   Duncan Hines   inventories in advance of the peak fall selling season. As a result, our inventory levels tend to be higher during August, September, and October, and thus we require more working capital during these months.  
    
  Inflation 
    
  To the extent possible, we strive to offset the effects of inflation with cost reduction and productivity programs.We expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion annually on Cost of products sold, therefore each 1% change in our weighted average cost of inputs would increase our Cost of products sold by approximately $23 million. If we experience significant inflation, price increases may be necessary in order to preserve our margins and returns. However, over the past several years, significant macroeconomic weakness and ongoing pressures on the consumer have resulted in shifting consumer buying patterns for grocery products.  As a result, industry volumes have come under pressure, hampering our ability to pass along higher input costs. Severe increases in inflation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     Table of Contents  

Three months ended   September 25, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 27, 2015    
  Net sales 
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   increased   $122.5 million  , or   19.3%  , versus year-ago to   $758.8 million  , reflecting a 19.0% increase from the benefit of the Boulder acquisition, higher net price realization of 0.2%, and an increase of 0.1% from volume/mix. 
  Net sales in our North America Retail business for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   increased   $4.4 million  , or   0.8%  , versus year-ago to   $558.5 million  , reflecting a 0.5% increase from volume/mix and higher net price realization of 0.3%. Our North American Retail business continued to outpace the performance of our composite categories, with market share growth of 0.6 percentage points in the quarter. 
  Birds Eye Frozen Segment: 
  Net sales in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   increased    $12.2 million  , or   4.1%  , versus year-ago to   $308.9 million  , reflecting a 3.8% increase from volume/mix and higher net price realization of 0.3%. The increase is primarily attributable to continued growth in the   Birds Eye   franchise, our   gardein   plant-based protein products and higher sales of   Hungry-Man   products. Recently-introduced innovation behind the   Birds Eye Flavor Full  ,   Birds Eye Protein Blends   and   Birds Eye   Disney-themed platforms, along with the new   Birds Eye Veggie Made Rice   side dishes, just-launched   Birds Eye Signature Skillets   premium     meals and the continued retail expansion of   Birds Eye Voila!   fueled the performance of the franchise. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of our   Aunt Jemima   breakfast products,   Celeste   pizza and   Lenders   frozen bagels. 
  Duncan Hines Grocery Segment: 
  Net sales in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $249.5 million  , a decline of    $7.8 million  , or   3.0%   versus year-ago, reflecting a 3.3% decrease from volume/mix, partially offset by higher net price realization of 0.3%. The period benefited from higher sales of   Wish-Bone   products, driven by our new   Wish-Bone EVOO   and   Wish-Bone Ristorante Italiano   product lines and increased sales of our   Armour   canned meats. More than offsetting this increase were lower net sales of our   Vlasic   pickles,   Duncan Hines   baking products and lower sales from our syrup business all driven by a highly competitive environment and category weakness.  
  Boulder Brands Segment: 
  Net sales in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $120.9 million  . Retail consumption has advanced versus year ago for the   Glutino  ,   Udi's  ,   Earth Balance   and   EVOL   brands, offset by a decline for   Smart Balance  . 
  Specialty Foods Segment: 
  Net sales in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $79.4 million  , a decline of   $2.8 million  , or   3.4%   versus year-ago, reflecting a 2.4% decrease from volume/mix and lower net price realization of 1.0%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower sales of private label canned meat. 
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   was   $228.7 million  , or   30.1%   of net sales, compared to   $176.9 million  , or   27.8%   of net sales, in the comparable prior year period reflecting strong productivity, favorable product mix, including the benefit of Boulder and the impact of items affecting comparability, primarily higher mark to market gains on financial instruments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were inflation and other items. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted gross profit advanced   24.2%   to   $229.1 million   and Adjusted gross profit percentage increased approximately   120   basis points to   30.2%  . 
  The following table outlines the factors resulting in the year on year change in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the three months ended   September 25, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

(a) Consists primarily of investment in new   Birds-Eye   stand-up packaging and higher product obsolescence. 
    
  Marketing and selling expenses 
  Marketing and selling expenses increased   22.0%   to   $53.9 million  , or   7.1%   of net sales, for the three months ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $44.2 million  , or   6.9%   of net sales for the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Boulder.  
  Administrative expenses 
  Administrative expenses were   $36.4 million  , or   4.8%   of net sales, for the three months ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $26.5 million  , or   4.2%   of net sales, for the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Boulder.  
    
  Research and development expenses 
  Research and development expenses were   $4.6 million  , or   0.6%   of net sales, for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   compared to   $3.2 million  , or   0.5%   of net sales, for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher expenses as a result of the Boulder acquisition. 
    
  Other income and expense 

Foreign exchange gains.   Represents foreign exchange gains from intra-entity loans resulting from the November 2014 Garden Protein acquisition that are anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future. 
    
  Tradename impairment charges 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded tradename impairments of   $7.3 million   on   Celeste  ,   $3.0 million   on   Aunt Jemima   and   $0.9 million   on   Snyder of Berlin  . See   Note 9   for further details.

Earnings before interest and taxes 
    
  Earnings before interest and taxes increased   $20.5 million  , or   20.9%  , to   $118.3 million  , reflecting the growth in gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling, and administrative expenses primarily due to the inclusion of Boulder Brands. Also impacting the comparison was items affecting comparability, which were charges of $16.3 million and $10.2 million in the three months ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. The variance in these items primarily resulted from tradename impairment charges, higher restructuring and integration costs resulting from the Boulder acquisition partially offset by higher unrealized mark to market gains on financial instruments. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes increased   $26.6 million   to   $134.6 million  , or   24.6%  . 
    
  Birds Eye Frozen Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   increased   4.3%  , or   $2.2 million  , versus year-ago to   $54.2 million   for the three months ended   September 25, 2016  , reflecting the benefits of net sales growth, productivity savings and favorable mix, partially offset by input cost inflation, investment in new   Birds-Eye   stand-up packaging and higher items affecting comparability, most notably $10.3 million of Tradename impairment charges. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes advanced   13.5%   to   $65.0 million  .  
    
  Duncan Hines Grocery Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $48.1 million  , an increase of   8.8%  , or   $3.9 million  , as compared to the year-ago period reflecting productivity savings and items affecting comparability more than offset by lower volumes, unfavorable product mix and input cost inflation. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes decreased   2.5%   to   $47.5 million  . 
    
  Boulder Brands Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $16.1 million  , reflecting significant restructuring expenses. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for the Boulder Brands segment totaled   $21.3 million  .  
  Specialty Foods Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   were   $6.3 million  , a decline of   18.8%  , or   $1.5 million  , as compared to the year-ago period, largely reflecting the decline in net sales and a  $0.9 million Tradename impairment charge. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes decreased   12.1%  , to   $7.1 million  . 
    
  Unallocated corporate expense: 
  Unallocated corporate expense for the three months ended   September 25, 2016   was   $6.5 million  , an increase of   $0.3 million  , as compared to the year-ago period.  
    
  Interest expense, net 
    
  Net interest expense increased   63.4%  , or   $14.1 million  , to   $36.4 million   in the three months ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $22.3 million   in the three months ended   September 27, 2015  . The increase was largely driven by additional debt issued to finance the Boulder acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the impact of higher interest expense for floating rate debt. Also impacting the comparison were   $0.6 million   of charges associated with the re-pricing of Term Loan I during the quarter and higher interest rate swap losses described below. 
    
  We utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce the potential exposure to interest rate movements and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt. Any gains or losses realized on the interest rate swap agreements, excluding the AOCL portion, are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense.  Included in net interest expense  was   $2.6 million   and   $1.1 million   for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, recorded from losses on interest rate swap agreements.

Provision for income taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate was 36.0% for the three months ended September 25, 2016 compared to 36.3% for the three months ended September 27, 2015.   
  For the three months ended September 25, 2016 and the three months ended September 27, 2015 our rate reflects the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction and tax credits and the effect of enacted state tax legislation.  For the three months ended September 25, 2016 our effective tax rate benefits from  a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions.  
  The Company is a loss corporation as defined by Section 382 of the Code. Section 382 places an annual limitation on our ability to use our NOL carryovers and other attributes to reduce future taxable income. As of September 25, 2016, we have federal NOL carryovers of $439.4 million subject to an annual limitation of $17.1 million.  As a result, $237.2 million of the carryovers exceed the estimated available Section 382 limitation.  The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets for this limitation. 
  We have significant tax-deductible intangible asset amortization and federal and state NOLs, which resulted in minimal federal and state cash taxes through 2015.  We expect continued amortization and utilization of our NOLs will generate modest annual cash tax savings in 2016 and thereafter. 

Nine months ended     September 25, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 27, 2015    
  Net sales 
  Net sales for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   increased   $336.1 million  , or   17.4%  , versus year-ago to   $2.27 billion  , reflecting a 17.8% increase from the benefit of the Boulder acquisition and higher net price realization of 0.5% partially offset by a 0.8% decrease from volume/mix.  Also impacting the comparison was unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.1%. 
  Net sales in our North American retail business for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   increased   0.4%   versus year-ago to   $1.69 billion  , reflecting higher net price realization of 0.6%, offset by a 0.1% decrease from volume/mix. Also impacting the comparison was unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.1%. We continued to outpace the performance of our composite categories, with market share growth in the nine months of 0.7 percentage points. 
  Birds Eye Frozen Segment: 
  Net sales in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   increased   4.6%   versus year-ago to   $924.1 million  , reflecting a 3.6% increase from volume/mix and higher net price realization of 1.0%. The increase is primarily attributable to continued strong sales from the   Birds Eye   franchise, our   gardein   plant-based protein products and our   Hungry-Man   frozen entr es. Products launched in 2015 such as   Birds Eye Steamfresh Flavor Full, Birds Eye Protein Blends   and   Birds Eye   Disney-themed side dishes for kids, continue to fuel the growth of   Birds Eye   vegetables, while distribution gains and the expansion of Family Size offerings and premium tier varieties drove the growth of   Birds Eye Voila!  . Partially offsetting these positive drivers were lower sales of our Seafood business, driven by category weakness, and lower sales of our   Aunt-Jemima, Lender's   and   Celeste   products.  
  Duncan Hines Grocery Segment: 
  Net sales in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   were   $763.2 million  , a decline of   4.2%  , reflecting higher net price realization of 0.3% more than offset by a 4.2% decrease from volume/mix and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.3%. The period benefited from higher sales of our   Armour   canned meats. This increase was more than offset by lower sales of our Duncan Hines baking products due to category weakness and lower sales of   Wish-Bone   products, reflecting a highly competitive category environment and new product introductory expenses from the launch of our two new product lines,   Wish-Bone EVOO   and   Wish-Bone Ristorante Italiano   dressing. Also impacting the period was lower sales of our syrup business driven by a highly competitive environment and lower net sales from our Canadian operations, including the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
  Boulder Brands Segment: 
  Net sales in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   were   $344.4 million  , representing the January 15, 2016 to   September 25, 2016   time period in which Boulder Brands was consolidated.

Specialty Foods Segment: 
  Net sales in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   decreased   6.1%   versus year-ago to   $237.8 million  , reflecting a 5.7% decline from volume/mix and lower net pricing of 0.4%. This decline was primarily driven by decreased sales of private label canned meat. 
    
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   was   $648.5 million  , or   28.6%   of net sales, compared to   $517.7 million  , or   26.8%   of net sales, in the comparable prior year period reflecting strong productivity, favorable product mix, the benefits of higher net price realization and the impact of items affecting comparability, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, higher depreciation and other items. Excluding these and other items affecting comparability, Adjusted gross profit advanced   24.2%   to   $653.3 million   and Adjusted gross profit percentage increased   160   basis points to   28.8%  .  
  The following table outlines the factors resulting in the year on year change in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  .  

(a) Represents expense related to the write-up to fair market value of inventories acquired as a result of the Boulder acquisition. 
  (b) The increase primarily relates to the insourcing of the manufacturing of   Wish-Bone   into our St. Elmo, Illinois location. 
  (c) Consists primarily of investment in new   Birds-Eye   stand-up packaging, higher product obsolescence, and the unfavorable impact of currency. 
    
  Marketing and selling expenses 
  Marketing and selling expenses were   $173.8 million  , or   7.7%   of net sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $136.9 million  , or   7.1%   of net sales, for the comparable prior year period. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the  Boulder  acquisition and an increase in marketing investment, including new product introductions. 
  Administrative expenses 
  Administrative expenses were   $126.0 million  , or   5.6%   of net sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $81.9 million  , or   4.2%   of net sales, for the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of Boulder, which included $17.3 million of restructuring costs in the current period.  
    
  Research and development expenses: 
  Research and development expenses were   $13.8 million  , or   0.6%   of net sales, for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   compared to   $9.9 million  , or   0.5%   of net sales, for the comparable prior year period. The increase primarily reflected higher expenses as a result of the Boulder acquisition and innovation related expenses.

  Tradename impairment charges 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded tradename impairments of   $7.3 million   on   Celeste  ,   $3.0 million   on   Aunt Jemima   and   $0.9 million   on   Snyder of Berlin  . See   Note 9   for further details. 
    
  Earnings before interest and taxes 
    
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the   nine months     ended   September 25, 2016   increased   $30.3 million  , or   11.0%  , versus year-ago to   $306.3 million  , primarily resulting from increased gross profit,  partially offset by the impact of items affecting comparability, most notably acquisition related expenses and tradename impairment charges, and higher marketing and selling and administrative expenses due to the consolidation of the Boulder acquisition. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes increased   $65.7 million   to   $356.1 million  , or   22.6%  . 
    
  Birds Eye Frozen Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   were   $156.2 million  , an increase of   $23.0 million  , or   17.3%  , as compared to the year-ago period largely reflecting increased gross profit driven by the benefit of net sales growth and productivity savings, partially offset by input cost inflation. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes increased   $23.2 million   to   $163.8 million  , or   16.5%  . 
    
  Duncan Hines Grocery Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   were   $143.0 million  , an increase of   $4.5 million  , or   3.3%  , as compared to the year-ago period, largely reflecting lower volume, higher new product introductory expenses, higher depreciation expenses and input cost inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of items affecting comparability. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  declined   $6.2 million   to   $139.2 million  , or   4.2%  . 
    
  Boulder Brands Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes was   $11.9 million  , reflecting significant acquisition related expenses. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for the Boulder Brands segment totaled   $50.8 million  .  
    
  Specialty Foods Segment: 
  Earnings before interest and taxes for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   were   $19.6 million  , a decline of   $3.5 million  , or   15.2%  , versus year-ago largely reflecting the decline in net sales and unfavorable product mix. Excluding items affecting comparability, Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes decreased   $3.3 million   to   $19.9 million   or   14.3%  .

Unallocated corporate expense: 
  Unallocated corporate  expense for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   was   $24.3 million  , as compared to   $18.7 million   in the year ago period. The increase primarily reflected the impact of the Boulder acquisition costs partially offset by lower equity based compensation expense driven by the change in CEO. 
    
  Interest expense, net 
  Net interest expense increased   56.9%  , or   $37.5 million  , to   $103.5 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   from   $66.0 million   in the nine months ended   September 27, 2015  .  The increase was largely driven by additional debt issued to finance the Boulder acquisition and, to a lesser extent, the impact of higher interest expense for floating rate debt. Also impacting the comparison were   $0.6 million   of charges associated with the re-pricing of Term Loan I during the period and higher interest rate swap losses described below. 
    
  We utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce the potential exposure to interest rate movements and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt. Any gains or losses realized on the interest rate swap agreements, excluding the AOCL portion, are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense.  Included in net interest expense was   $6.3 million   and   $2.5 million   for the first   nine months   of 2016 and 2015, respectively,  recorded from losses on interest rate swap agreements.  
    
  Provision for income taxes 
  The effective tax rate was 39.4% for the nine months ended September 25, 2016 compared to 36.6% for the nine months ended September 27, 2015.   
  In connection with our acquisition of Boulder, our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 25, 2016 increased by 3.7% due to the tax effect of certain non-deductible acquisition costs and compensation payments, a charge for an increase in our non-current state deferred income tax liability balance and a charge related to the tax effect of foreign operations, principally attributable to a valuation allowance on our foreign tax credit carryforward.   Our income tax rate for the nine months     September 27, 2015 reflects a     deferred tax benefit of  0.9% for changes related to our state tax profile. 
  The Company is a loss corporation as defined by Section 382 of the Code. Section 382 places an annual limitation on our ability to use our NOL carryovers and other attributes to reduce future taxable income. As of September 26, 2016, we have NOL carryovers of $439.4 million subject to an annual limitation of $17.1 million.  As a result, $237.2 million of the carryovers exceed the estimated available Section 382 limitation.  The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets for this limitation. 
  On January 15, 2016 we acquired Boulder which is a loss corporation.  As of the acquisition date, Boulder had approximately $50.8 million of federal NOL carryovers subject to the Section 382 provisions.  The annual limitation is approximately $26.5 million subject to increase for recognized built in gains during the recognition period.  Based on our analysis, we anticipate we will be able to utilize the acquired NOL balance in our 2016 tax year without limitation.   
  We have significant tax-deductible intangible asset amortization and federal and state NOLs, which resulted in minimal federal and state cash taxes through 2015.  We expect continued amortization and utilization of our NOLs will generate modest annual cash tax savings in 2016 and thereafter. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Historical 
  Our cash flows are seasonal. Typically we are a net user of cash in the third quarter of the calendar year (i.e., the quarter ending in September) and a net generator of cash over the balance of the year. 
  Our principal liquidity requirements have been, and we expect will be, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, debt service and our quarterly dividend program. Currently, the quarterly payment is $0.285 per share, or approximately $34 million per quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $110 to $120 million in 2016, including Boulder. We have historically satisfied our liquidity requirements with internally generated cash flows and availability under our revolving credit facility. We expect that our ability to generate cash from our operations and ability to borrow from our credit facilities should be sufficient to support working capital needs, planned growth, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. We have cash in foreign accounts, primarily related to the operations of our Canadian businesses. Tax liabilities related to bringing these funds back into the United States would not be significant and have been accrued.

Statements of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015    
  For the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , net cash flow decreased   $15.6 million   compared to an increase in net cash flow of   $34.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  . 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $239.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016  , and was the result of net earnings, excluding non-cash charges and credits, of   $237.3 million   and an increase in working capital of   $2.6 million  . The increase in working capital was primarily the result of a   $40.7 million   increase in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, a   $31.9 million   increase in inventories during the harvest season and a   $1.7 million   decrease in accrued trade marketing expense. These were partially offset by a   $31.6 million   increase in accounts payable resulting from seasonality and timing of disbursements, a   $29.8 million   increase in accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to higher interest and restructuring accruals and a   $15.6 million   decrease  in other current assets primarily from lower prepaid tax balances. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $210.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2015, and was the result of net earnings, excluding non-cash charges and credits, of $270.4 million and an increase in working capital of $59.5 million. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of a $90.3 million increase in inventories resulting from favorable agricultural crop yields and innovation related inventory build, and a $19.4 million increase in accounts receivable driven by the timing of sales. The aging profile of accounts receivable has not changed significantly from December 2014. This was partially offset by a $32.7 million increase in accounts payable resulting from seasonal timing, a $14.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to consumer coupons and higher interest accruals and a $2.3 million decrease in accrued trade marketing expense. All other working capital accounts generated a net $0.9 million cash inflow. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $1,062.0 million  , for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   and included   $985.4 million   for the acquisition of Boulder as well as   $76.6 million   for capital expenditures. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was $82.9 million, for the nine months ended September 27, 2015 and included $84.7 million for capital expenditures as well as $1.1 million of cash inflows from a Garden Protein acquisition post closing working capital adjustment. Capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2015 included approximately $21.8 million of costs related to our acquisition integration projects. Investing activities also included $0.7 million of proceeds from the sale of assets. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months   ended   September 25, 2016   was   $806.2 million   and consisted of   $547.3 million   of net proceeds from our new Tranche I Term Loans,   $350.0 million   from our notes offering and $34.6 million of net cash inflows related to our equity based compensation plans which were partially offset by   $89.3 million   of dividends paid,   $22.6 million   of debt acquisition costs,   $10.1 million   of debt repayments, $3.7 million of net cash outflows for capital leases and notes payable activity. 
    
  Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2015 was $92.6 million and consisted of $82.1 million of dividends paid, $6.6 million of debt repayments and $3.9 million of net capital leases and notes payable activity. 

Debt 
    
  For more information on our debt, see   Note 10   of the Consolidated Financial Statements "Debt and Interest Expense".  

Covenant Compliance 
    
  The following is a discussion of the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements. See section below for detailed calculation. 
  Amended Credit Agreement 
  Our Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to: 
             
    incur additional indebtedness and make guarantees; 
                
    create liens on assets; 
                
    engage in mergers or consolidations; 
     
   52 

     Table of Contents  

sell assets; 
                
    pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock; 
                
    make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; and 
                
    engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
       
  The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. 
    
  5.875% Senior Notes and 4.875% Senior Notes 
    
  In April 2013, we issued the 4.875% Senior Notes. In January 2016, we issued the 5.875% Senior Notes.  We refer to the 4.875% Notes and the 5.875% Notes as the "Senior Notes". The Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations, effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness, and guaranteed on a full, unconditional, joint and several basis by the Company and Pinnacle Foods Finance's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our other indebtedness. 
  The indentures governing the Senior Notes limits our (and our restricted subsidiaries ) ability to, subject to certain exceptions: 
             
    incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; 
                
    pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; 
                
    make certain investments; 
                
    sell certain assets; 
                
    create liens on certain assets to secure debt; 
                
    consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; 
                
    enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and 
                
    designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 
     Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture governing the Senior Notes permits us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
     Pinnacle uses the following non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. 

Adjusted gross profit 
                
    Adjusted gross profit as a % of sales 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA 
                
    Adjusted Earnings before Interest and Taxes (Adjusted EBIT) 
                
    Covenant Compliance EBITDA 
       
  Adjusted gross profit 
  Pinnacle defines Adjusted gross profit as gross profit before accelerated depreciation related to restructuring activities, certain non-cash items, acquisition, merger and other restructuring charges and other adjustments. The Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted gross profit is useful to investors in the evaluation of the operating performance of companies in similar industries.  The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the Company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. In addition, Adjusted gross profit is one of the components used to evaluate the performance of Company s management. Such targets include, but are not limited to, measurement of sales efficiency, productivity measures and recognition of acquisition synergies. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Pinnacle defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, non-recurring items and certain other adjustment items permitted in calculating Covenant Compliance EBITDA under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA does not include adjustments for equity-based compensation and certain other adjustments related to acquisitions, both of which are permitted in calculating Covenant Compliance EBITDA.

     Table of Contents  

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA  as a key metric in the evaluation of underlying Company performance, in making financial, operating and planning decisions and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers and employees. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it increases transparency and assists investors in understanding the underlying performance of the Company and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. Additionally, Pinnacle believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information, as it is an important component in determining our ability to service debt and meet any payment obligations. In addition, Pinnacle believes that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an Adjusted EBITDA measure when reporting their results. The Company has historically reported Adjusted EBITDA to analysts and investors and believes that its continued inclusion provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net earnings (loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. 
    
  Adjusted Earnings before Interest and Taxes (Adjusted EBIT) 
  Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes is provided because Pinnacle believes it is useful information in understanding our EBIT results by improving the comparability of year-to-year results. Additionally, Adjusted EBIT provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing the Company and its segments, primary operating results from period to period after removing the impact of unusual, non-operational or restructuring-related activities that affect comparability. Adjusted EBIT is one of the measures management uses for planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. 
    
  Covenant Compliance EBITDA 
  Covenant Compliance EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude non-cash items, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items and other adjustment items permitted in calculating Covenant Compliance EBITDA under the Amended Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Covenant Compliance EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financial covenants. 
  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Compliance EBITDA do not represent net earnings or (loss) or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In particular, the definitions of Covenant Compliance EBITDA in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures allow Pinnacle to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net earnings or loss. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. While EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Compliance EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, Pinnacle Foods Finance is required to maintain a ratio of Net First Lien Secured Debt to Covenant Compliance EBITDA of no greater than 5.75 to 1.00. Net First Lien Secured Debt is defined as Pinnacle Foods Finance's aggregate consolidated secured indebtedness secured on a first lien basis, less the aggregate amount of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
  In addition, under the Amended Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (which is currently the same as the ratio of Net First Lien Secured Debt to Covenant Compliance EBITDA described above), in the case of the Amended Credit Agreement, or to the ratio of Covenant Compliance EBITDA to fixed charges for the most recently concluded four consecutive fiscal quarters, in the case of the Senior Notes.  We believe that these covenants are material terms of these agreements and that information about the covenants is material to an investor's understanding our financial performance.  As of   September 25, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants and other obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Senior Notes. 
  Our ability to meet the covenants specified above in future periods will depend on events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants in the future could result in a default under, or an inability to undertake certain activities in compliance with, the Amended Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Senior Notes, at which time the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. Any such acceleration would also result in a default under the indentures governing the Senior Notes.

_________________ 
           (1) 
    Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, Pinnacle Foods Finance is required to maintain a ratio of Net First Lien Secured Debt to Covenant Compliance EBITDA of no greater than 5.75 to 1.00. Net First Lien Secured Debt is defined as Pinnacle Foods Finance's aggregate consolidated secured indebtedness secured on a first lien priority basis, less the aggregate amount of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
              (2) 
    The Total Leverage Ratio is not a financial covenant but is used to determine the applicable margin rate under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of   September 25, 2016  , our total net leverage ratio was greater than 4.25:1.0, which results in an additional 25 basis point margin on existing Term Loans G and H under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Total Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total debt less the aggregate amount of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents by Covenant Compliance EBITDA. 
              (3) 
    Our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under the indentures governing the Senior Notes, subject to specified exceptions, is tied to a Covenant Compliance EBITDA to fixed charges ratio of at least 2.00 to 1.00. 
              (4) 
    Fixed charges is defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes as (i) consolidated interest expense (excluding specified items)   plus   consolidated capitalized interest   less   consolidated interest income,   plus   (ii) cash dividends and distributions paid on preferred stock or disqualified stock.

  As of   September 25, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet obligations.  
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
    
  We have disclosed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016, those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining our results of operations and financial condition. Other than the below disclosure, there have been no material changes to those policies that we consider to be significant since the filing of the 10-K. We believe that the accounting principles utilized in preparing our unaudited consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to GAAP. 
    
  Revenue recognition 
    
  Through the first six months of 2016, Boulder Brands recognized revenue upon the receipt and acceptance of product by the customer. The earnings process is complete once the customer order has been placed and approved and the product shipped has been received by the customer. For the base Pinnacle business, revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customers as terms are free on board ("FOB") shipping point, at which point title and risk of loss is transferred. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company aligned Boulder's revenue recognition policy with the base Pinnacle business. 

ITEM 3:     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  F  INANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Risk Management Strategy 
  We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk. Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Please refer to   Note 12   of the Consolidated Financial Statements "Financial Instruments" for additional details regarding our derivatives and refer to   Note 10   of the Consolidated Financial Statements "Debt and Interest Expense" for additional details regarding our debt instruments.  There were no significant changes in our exposures to market risk since   December 27, 2015  . 
  See  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  included in our Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 25, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a level of reasonable assurance.

  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 25, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
