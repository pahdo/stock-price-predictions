  Notes to Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Note 1   Description of business and summary of significant accounting policies 
  Description of business 
  Tecogen Inc., or the Company, was organized as a Delaware Corporation on November 15, 2000, and acquired the assets and liabilities of the Tecogen Products division of Thermo Power Corporation.  The Company produces commercial and industrial, natural-gas-fueled engine-driven, combined heat and power (CHP) products that reduce energy costs, decrease greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate congestion on the national power grid.  The Company s products supply electric power or mechanical power for cooling, while heat from the engine is recovered and purposefully used at a facility.  The majority of the Company s customers are located in regions with the highest utility rates, typically California, the Midwest and the Northeast.  The Company's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol TGEN. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and notes necessary for a complete presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  We filed audited financial statements which included all information and notes necessary for such presentation for the two years ended   December 31, 2015   in conjunction with our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, or our Annual Report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on   March 30, 2016  .  This form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position at   September 30, 2016  , and of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The results of operations for the interim periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year.  
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Ilios Inc. or Ilios, whose business focus is on advanced heating systems for commercial and industrial applications.  In May 2016, the Company completed an exchange of common stock with the shareholders of Ilios and effected a statutory merger.   Ilios is no longer a separate subsidiary.   
  The Company s operations are comprised of   one   business segment.  Our business is to manufacture and support highly efficient CHP products based on engines fueled by natural gas. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Generally, sales of cogeneration and chiller units and parts are recognized when shipped and services are recognized over the term of the service period.  Payments received in advance of services being performed or as a deposit on equipment are recorded as deferred revenue. 
  The Company recognizes revenue in certain circumstances before delivery has occurred (commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions).  In such circumstances, among other things, risk of ownership has passed to the buyer, the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods, the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them, and no additional performance obligations exist by the Company.  For these transactions, the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted.  At the period ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues of   $1,548,422   were recorded as bill and hold transactions.  For the same period in   2015  ,   $747,328   revenues were recorded as bill and hold transactions. 
  For those arrangements that include multiple deliverables, the Company first determines whether each service or deliverable meets the separation criteria of FASB ASC 605-25,   Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements  .  In general, a deliverable (or a group of deliverables) meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has stand-alone value to the customer and if the arrangement includes a general right of return related to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in control of the Company.  Each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate   unit of accounting .  The Company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting

  Notes to Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

using the relative fair value method.  The amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting. 
  When vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence is not available, adopting the relative fair value method of allocation permits the Company to recognize revenue on specific elements as completed based on the estimated selling price.  The Company generally uses internal pricing lists that determine sales prices to external customers in determining its best estimate of the selling price of the various deliverables in multiple-element arrangements.  Changes in judgments made in estimating the selling price of the various deliverables could significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition.  The Company enters into sales arrangements with customers to sell its cogeneration and chiller units and related service contracts and occasionally installation services.  Based on the fact that the Company sells each deliverable to other customers on a stand-alone basis, the Company has determined that each deliverable has a stand-alone value.  Additionally, there are no rights of return relative to the delivered items; therefore, each deliverable is considered a separate unit of accounting. 
  After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each unit of accounting, the Company applies the appropriate revenue recognition method for each unit of accounting based on the nature of the arrangement and the services included in each unit of accounting.  Cogeneration and chiller units are recognized when shipped and services are recognized over the term of the applicable agreement, or as provided when on a time and materials basis. 
  In some cases, our customers may choose to have the Company engineer and install the system for them rather than simply purchase the cogeneration and/or chiller units.  In this case, the Company accounts for revenue, or turnkey revenue, and costs using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, revenues are recognized by applying percentages of completion to the total estimated revenues for the respective contracts.  Costs are recognized as incurred.  The percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost at completion of the respective contracts.  When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, the Company s policy is to record the entire expected loss, regardless of the percentage of completion.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, a loss of approximately   $164,000   and   $0  , respectively was recorded.  The excess of contract costs and profit recognized to date on the percentage-of-completion accounting method in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled revenue.  Billings in excess of related costs and estimated profit is recorded as deferred revenue. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the period.  Bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately   $44,000   and   $50,000  , respectively. 
  Inventory 
  Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value.  The Company periodically reviews inventory quantities on hand for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand.  Any reserves that result from this review are charged to cost of sales.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , inventory reserves were   $203,000   and   $293,000  , respectively.  
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset, which range from   three   to   fifteen   years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the related leases.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed currently, while renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of an asset are capitalized.  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation expense was   $42,084   and   $42,366  , and   $125,255   and   $129,775  , respectively. 
  Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the intangible asset.  The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment when the circumstances warrant. 
  Goodwill 
  The Company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist, by determining if the carrying value of the Company's single reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  During the   first nine months of 2016  , the Company determined that no interim impairment test was necessary.

Stock-Based Compensation 
  Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period.  The fair value of stock options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model.  The Company recognizes compensation on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting portion of the option award.  The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards is affected by the Company s stock price.  The Company uses the simplified method for awards of stock-based compensation since it does not have the necessary historical exercise and forfeiture data to determine an expected life for stock options.  (see Note 5) 
  Revenues by Product 
  The following table summarizes net revenue by product line and services for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

Reclassification 
  Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. The interest expense includes the amortization of the deferred financing costs, and this has been adjusted in the comparable periods.  The balance of deferred financing cost on the balance sheet under ASU 2015-03 is netted with the associated debt and is retrospectively shown for prior period balances. 
   
  Note 2   Income (Loss) per common share 
  All shares issuable for both periods were anti-dilutive because of the reported net loss.  Basic and diluted loss per share for the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, were as follows:

Note 3   Demand notes payable, convertible debentures and line of credit agreement to related parties 
  On December 23, 2013, the Company entered into a Senior Convertible Promissory Note or the Note, with Michaelson Capital Special Finance Fund LP or Michaelson, for the principal amount of   $3,000,000   with interest at   4%   per annum for a term of   three   years.  In the event of default such interest rate shall accrue at   8%   after the occurrence of the event of default and during continuance plus   2%   after the occurrence and during the continuance of any other event of default.  The Note is a senior unsecured obligation which pays interest only on a monthly basis in arrears at a rate of   4%   per annum, unless earlier converted in accordance with the terms of the agreement prior to such date.  Effective April 1, 2016, the Note was amended increasing the principal amount by   $150,000   for a total of   $3,150,000   and extending the maturity date.  The principal amount, if not converted, is now due on the fifth anniversary of the Note, December 28, 2018.  The Note is senior in right of payment to any unsecured indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note.  
  The principal balance of the Note, together with any unpaid interest, is convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at   282.49   shares of the Company's common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of Note (equivalent to a conversion price of   $3.54   per share) at the option of Michaelson.  If at any time the common stock of the Company is (1) trading on a national securities exchange, (2) qualifies for unrestricted resale under federal securities laws and (3) the arithmetic average of the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for    twenty   consecutive trading days preceding the Company's notice of mandatory conversion exceeds   $150,000  , the Company shall have the right to require conversion of all of the then outstanding principal balance together with unpaid interest of this Note into the Company's common stock based on the conversion price of   $3.54   per share.  The Company may prepay all of the outstanding principal and interest due and payable under this Note in full, at any time prior to the maturity date for an amount equal to   120%   of the then outstanding principal and interest due and payable as of the date of such prepayment. 
  Upon change of control, as defined by the Note, at Michaelson's option, the obligations may be assumed, on the terms and conditions in this Note, through an assignment and assumption agreement, or the Company may prepay all of the then outstanding principal and unpaid interest under this Note in full at the optional   120%   prepayment amount.  This provision creates an embedded derivative in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.  As such it is required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Note.  However, the Company has determined that the fair value of the embedded derivative is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.  Debt issuance costs are netted against the principal balance of the debt.   
  As per an amendment to the Note dated April 1, 2016, the conversion price was increased from   $3.37   to   $3.54   and the number of shares issuable upon conversion decreased from   890,207   at December 31, 2015 to   889,830   at April 1, 2016.  The Company has determined that changes resulting from this modification were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. 
  On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement, or the Agreement, with John N. Hatsopoulos, the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officer and a Company Director.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Hatsopoulos has agreed to lend the Company up to an aggregate of   $2,000,000  , with a withdrawal limit of   $250,000   per financial calendar quarter, at the written request of the Company.  Any amounts borrowed by the Company pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest at   6%   per year. Interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears.  The term of the Agreement is from July 1, 2015 to July 1, 2017.  Repayment of the principal amount borrowed pursuant to the Agreement will be due on July 1, 2017, or the Maturity Date.  Prepayment of any amounts due under the Agreement may be made at any time without penalty. The Agreement terminates on the Maturity Date. The Company has not yet borrowed any amounts pursuant to the Agreement. 
   
  Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Ilios subsidiary 
  Beginning on April 11, 2016 through its conclusion on May 3, 2016, the Company entered into numerous private placement share exchange agreements ("Share Exchange Agreements") with shareholders of Ilios ("Exchanging Shareholders"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.  Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreements, the Exchanging Shareholders agreed to exchange every   7.86   of their restricted Ilios shares of common stock for 1 share of the Company's restricted common stock.  In addition, the Company granted each Exchanging Shareholder registration rights of the Company's common stock they received in exchange for their Ilios shares.  The Company issued a total of   670,464   shares of its common stock in exchange for Ilios shares of common stock.  Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares. 
  Upon execution of the exchange agreements for   100%   of the shares of Ilios, the Company no longer had a non-controlling interest in its subsidiary.  On April 30, 2016, Ilios was merged into the Company, and accounting for the noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary ended. 
   
  Note 5 - Stock-based compensation 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  In 2006, the Company adopted the 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan or the Plan, under which the Board of Directors may grant incentive or non-qualified stock options and stock grants to key employees, directors, advisors and consultants of the Company.  The Plan was amended at various dates by the Board of Directors to increase the reserved shares of common stock issuable under the Plan to   3,838,750   as of   September 30, 2016  , or the Amended Plan.

Stock options vest based upon the terms within the individual option grants, with an acceleration of the unvested portion of such options upon a change in control event, as defined in the Amended Plan.  The options are not transferable except by will or domestic relations order.  The option price per share under the Amended Plan cannot be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant.  The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the Amended Plan as of   September 30, 2016   was   1,627,357  . 
  Stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was as follows:  

Consolidated stock-based compensation expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $117,065   and   $90,971  , respectively.  No tax benefit was recognized related to the stock-based compensation recorded during the periods. 
   
  Note 6   Commitments and contingencies 
  Letters of Credit 
  On January 28, 2016, the letter of credit from Enterprise Bank and Trust Company required for collateral with an outstanding performance bond was closed as the Company had met the performance obligations of the bond. 
   
  Note 7   Related party transactions and Joint Ventures 
  The Company has   two   affiliated companies, namely American DG Energy Inc., or American DG Energy, and EuroSite Power Inc. or EuroSite Power.  These companies are affiliates because several of the major stockholders of those companies, have a significant ownership position in the Company.  Neither American DG Energy nor EuroSite Power own any shares of the Company, and the Company does not own any shares of American DG Energy or EuroSite Power. 
  On December 23, 2013, the Company entered into a Senior Convertible Promissory Note with Michaelson Capital Special Finance Fund LP (see Note 3).  This agreement came with board observation rights causing the related party status. 
  On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with John N. Hatsopoulos, the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officer and a Company Director (see Note 3). 
  The Company provides office space and certain utilities to American DG Energy based on a monthly rate set at the beginning of each year.  This sublease was signed on July 1, 2014 and subsequently amended.  The lease will expire on July 1, 2017.  The agreement contains an automatic monthly renewal at expiration.  In addition, the Company pays certain operating expenses, including benefits and insurance, on behalf of American DG Energy.  The Company is reimbursed for these costs. 
  Ultra Emissions Technologies Ltd. 
  On December 28, 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement relating to the formation of a joint venture company (the  JV ) organized to develop and commercialize Tecogen s patented technology ( Ultera        Technology ) designed to reduce harmful emissions generated by engines using fossil fuels.  The joint venture company, called Ultra Emissions Technologies Limited, was organized under the laws of the Island of Jersey, Channel Islands.  
  The Company received a   50%   equity interest in the JV in exchange for a fully paid-up worldwide license to use Tecogen s Ultera emissions control technology in the field of mobile vehicles burning fossil fuels. The other half of the joint venture equity interests were purchased for   $3,000,000   by a small group of offshore investors.  Warrants to purchase additional equity securities in the JV were granted to all parties pro rata. If the venture is not successful, all licensed intellectual property rights will revert to Tecogen.

  Notes to Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The JV is expected to have losses as it performs the necessary research and development with the Ultera technology.  On August 2, 2016, Tecogen exercised   2,000,000   warrants (the "Ultratek Warrants"), in the JV, at   $1.00   per share, for an aggregate amount of   $2 million  .  The funds used to exercise the Ultratek Warrants were acquired by the Company from the holders of certain Company warrants (the "Tecogen Warrant Holders"), when they partially exercised their Tecogen warrants (the "Tecogen Warrants"),  in July of 2016. The Tecogen Warrant Holders exercised a total of   675,000   Tecogen Warrants with a   $4.00   exercise price, resulting in cash proceeds of   $2,700,000   to the Company, which the Company then used some of the proceeds to invest in the JV.  An additional $6,500,000 was raised from other outside investors for a total equity investment to date of $13,500,000.  Due to this additional capital raise, Tecogen's ownership has decreased to 43%.   
  The Company is accounting for its interest in the JV using the equity method.  Income and losses will be recorded consistent with an agreement between the JV shareholders as to how income and losses will be allocated.  These allocations are consistent with the allocation of cash distributions and liquidating distributions of the JV.  The shareholder agreement calls for Tecogen's investment to be returned before any other shareholder if the venture does not achieve commercialization.  As a result, as of September 30, 2016, Tecogen has not recorded any of the income or losses of the JV. 
  TTcogen LLC 
  On May 19, 2016, the Company along with Tedom a.s., a corporation incorporated in the Czech Republic and a European combined heat and power product manufacturer, ("Tedom") entered into a joint venture, where the Company will hold a   50%   participating interest and the remaining   50%   interest will be with Tedom.  As part of the joint venture, the parties agreed to create a Delaware limited liability company, TTcogen LLC ("TTcogen"), to carry out the business of the venture.  Tedom granted TTcogen the sole and exclusive right to market, sell, offer for sale, and distribute certain products as agreed to by the parties throughout the United States.  The product offerings of the joint venture expand the current Tecogen product offerings to the MicroCHP of 35kW to large 4,000kW plants.  Tecogen agreed to refer all appropriate sale leads to TTcogen regarding the products agreed to by the parties and Tecogen shall have the first right to repair and maintain the products sold by TTcogen. 
  The TTcogen operations will be accounted for using equity method accounting.  Any losses on the initial operation of the entity will not be consolidated in Tecogen's financial statements.  Since Tecogen does not guarantee obligations of TTcogen, losses or liabilities of the joint venture are not recorded on the Company's financial statements.  Using equity method accounting, as the venture becomes profitable with the expected growth, realized gains from profits will be added to the an investment asset account on the consolidated balance sheet.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Forward-looking statements are made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.  Without limiting the foregoing, the words  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   seeks,   estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our current and future cash requirements, our expectations regarding suppliers of cogeneration units, and statements regarding potential financing activities in the future.  While the Company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the Company s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the Company s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report.  There are a number of important factors that could cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report. 
  Overview 
  Tecogen Inc., or the Company, or Tecogen, designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems that produce combinations of electricity, hot water and air conditioning using automotive engines that have been specially adapted to run on natural gas.  In some cases, our customers may choose to have the Company engineer and install the system for them rather than simply purchase the cogeneration and/or chiller units, which we refer to as "turnkey" projects.  Cogeneration systems are efficient because in addition to supplying mechanical energy to power electric generators or compressors   displacing utility supplied electricity   they provide opportunity for the facility to incorporate the engine s waste heat into onsite processes such as space and portable water heating.  We produce standardized, modular, small-scale products, with a limited number of product configurations that are adaptable to multiple applications.  We refer to these combined heat and power products as CHP (electricity plus heat) and MCHP (mechanical power plus heat). 
  In addition to being a smaller reporting company, Tecogen is an emerging growth company as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act).

Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $3,841,637   compared to   $3,007,111   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $834,526  , or   27.8%  .

The increase in margins was the direct result of product upgrades and improvements.  Management expects growth in sales volume to maintain this gross margin going forward.

The increase in margins was the direct result of product upgrades and improvements which were phased in over the first   nine   months.  Management expects growth in sales volume to continue to improve gross margins going forward as lower margin quarters roll off the trailing period results.

  Cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $2,914,863   compared to   $3,354,719   for the same period in   2015  .  Our accounts receivable balance   increased   to   $7,957,325   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5,286,863   at   December 31, 2015  , using   $2,664,462   of cash due to timing of billing, shipments, and collections.

Backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  Our presentation of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry. 
  Accounts payable   decreased   to   $3,032,613   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $3,311,809   at   December 31, 2015  ,   using      $279,196   in cash flow from operations.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates 
  The Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above and in our Annual Report.  The accounting policies and estimates that can have a significant impact upon the operating results, financial position and footnote disclosures of the Company are described in the above notes and in our Annual Report. 
  Seasonality 
  We expect that the majority of our heating systems sales will be in the winter and the majority of our chilling systems sales will be in the summer.  Our cogeneration and chiller system sales are not generally affected by the seasons, although customer goals will be to have chillers installed and running in the spring.  Our service team does experience higher demand in the warmer months when cooling is required.  These units are generally shut down in the winter and started up again in the spring.  This  busy season  for the service team generally runs from May through the end of September. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts.  We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Not applicable. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
  The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.  Our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in financial reporting relating to lack of personnel with a sufficient level of accounting knowledge and a small number of employees dealing with general controls over information technology.  Management will continue to evaluate the above weaknesses, and as the Company grows and resources become available, the Company plans to take the necessary steps in the future to remediate the weaknesses. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
  The Company currently does not have personnel with a sufficient level of accounting experience and training in the selection, application and implementation of generally accepted accounting principles as it relates to complex transactions and financial reporting requirements.  The Company also has a small number of employees dealing with general controls over information technology security and user access.  This constitutes a material weakness in financial reporting. 
  In connection with the material weaknesses referred to in the foregoing paragraph, we will make changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as soon as the resources become available.  During the period ended   September 30, 2016  , no changes have been made to the Company's process.

           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Tecogen Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
