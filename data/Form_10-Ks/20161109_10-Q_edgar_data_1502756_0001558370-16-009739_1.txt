NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

(1) BUSINESS   AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Business  

Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on May 4, 2007, and is the operating parent company of a number of subsidiaries engaged in bandwidth infrastructure services. Zayo Group LLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as  Zayo Group  or the  Company.  Headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, the Company operates bandwidth infrastructure assets, including fiber networks and data centers, in the United States, Canada and Europe to offer:  

Dark Fiber Solutions, including dark fiber and mobile infrastructure services.      

Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure, including cloud and colocation services.     

Network Connectivity, wavelengths, Ethernet, IP and SONET services.      

Other services, including Zayo Professional Services ( ZPS ), voice and unified communications.     

Zayo Group is wholly owned by Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings  or  ZGH ). 

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and do not include all of the note disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These consolidated financial statements should, therefore, be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company have been included herein. Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been condensed to conform to the current period presentation and had no impact on reported net income or losses. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future interim period or the full year.  

The Company s fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as  Fiscal 2016  and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 as  Fiscal 2017.   

Significant Accounting Policies  

Upon early adoption of ASU 2016-09 (as described below), the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur versus estimating forfeitures. The Company recognizes all stock-based awards to employees and independent directors based on their grant-date fair values, with no estimated forfeiture consideration. The Company recognizes the fair value of outstanding awards as a charge to operations over the vesting period. 

There have been no other changes to the Company s significant accounting policies described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures   

6 

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used when establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and accruals for billing disputes, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization and accruals for exit activities associated with real estate leases, assessing the need for impairment charges (including those related to intangible assets and goodwill), determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, determining the defined benefit costs and defined benefit obligations related to post-employment benefits and estimating the restricted stock unit grant fair values used to compute the stock-based compensation liability and expense. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and makes estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classifications of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The new standard provides guidance for eight changes with respect to how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after   December 31, 2017  , with early adoption permitted. The Company does not plan to early adopt, nor does it expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . The new guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in Topic 840 and is intended to increase the transparency and comparability of accounting for lease transactions. ASU 2016-02 requires most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Lessees will need to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09). The ASU will require both quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.   The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative. The ASU changes five aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions that will affect public companies, including: (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes.   The Company early-adopted ASU 2016-09 effective July 1, 2016. Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are now recognized against income tax expense rather than additional paid-in capital and are included in operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows. The recognition of excess tax benefits have been applied prospectively and prior

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

periods have not been adjusted. The Company did not have any excess tax benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  In addition, the Company elected to change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur. The change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of $1.7 million as of July 1, 2016. Amendments related to minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and the classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes have been adopted prospectively and did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date or annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company and its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

(2) ACQUISITIONS  

Since inception, the Company has consummated 38 transactions accounted for as business combinations. The acquisitions were executed as part of the Company s business strategy of expanding through acquisitions. The acquisitions of these businesses have allowed the Company to increase the scale at which it operates, which in turn affords the Company the ability to increase its operating leverage, extend its network reach, and broaden its customer base.  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of the acquired entities from their respective acquisition dates. The Company has not completed any transactions accounted for as a business combination during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Acquisitions Completed During Fiscal 2016  

Clearview 

On April 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest in Clearview International, LLC ( Clearview ), a Texas based colocation and cloud infrastructure services provider for cash consideration of $18.3 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.  $1.7 million of the purchase consideration is currently held in escrow pending the expiration of the indemnification adjustment period. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered an asset purchase for tax purposes. 

The acquisition consisted of two Texas data centers. The data centers, located at 6606 LBJ Freeway in Dallas, Texas and 700 Austin Avenue in Waco, Texas, added approximately 30,000 square feet of colocation space, as well as a set of hybrid cloud infrastructure services that complement the Company s global cloud capabilities.    

Allstream 

On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest in Allstream, Inc. and Allstream Fiber U.S. Inc. (together  Allstream ) from Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. ( MTS ) for cash consideration of CAD $422.9 million (or $297.6 million), net of cash acquired, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The consideration paid is net of CAD $42.1 million (or $2  9.6   million) of working capital and other liabilities assumed by the Company in the

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

acquisition. The acquisition was funded with Term Loan Proceeds (as defined in Note 5     Long-Term Debt  ). CAD $4.2 million (or $3.2 million) is currently held in escrow pending the expiration of the indemnification adjustment period. The acquisition was considered a stock purchase for tax purposes. 

The acquisition added more than 18,000 route miles to the Company s fiber network, including 12,500 miles of long-haul fiber connecting all major Canadian markets and 5,500 route miles of metro fiber network connecting approximately 3,300 on-net buildings concentrated in Canada s top five metropolitan markets. 

As part of the Allstream acquisition, MTS agreed to retain Allstream s former defined benefit pension obligations, and related pension plan assets, of retirees and other former employees of Allstream and also agreed to reimburse Allstream for certain solvency funding payments related to the pension obligations of active Allstream employees as of January 15, 2016.  MTS will transfer assets from Allstream s former defined benefit pension plans related to pre-closing service obligations for active employees to a new Allstream defined benefit pension plans created by the Company, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, if the pre-closing benefit obligation for the January 15, 2016 active employees exceeds the fair value of assets transferred to the new Allstream pension plans, MTS agreed to fund the funding deficiency at the later of the asset transfer date or the date at which it is determined that no further solvency deficit exists. Any required funding of the pension benefit obligation subsequent to January 15, 2016, will be the responsibility of the Company. The amount of the funding deficiency was not material to the financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  

Also as part of the Allstream acquisition, the Company assumed the liabilities related to Allstream s other non-pension unfunded post retirement benefits plans. The liability assumed on January 15, 2016 was approximately CAD $12.8 million (or $8.3 million). The balance of this liability as of September 30, 2016 was approximately CAD $13.0 million (or $9.9 million). This liability is currently included in  Other long-term liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Viatel 

On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in Viatel Infrastructure Europe Ltd., Viatel (UK) Limited, Viatel France SAS, Viatel Deutschland GmbH and Viatel Nederland BV (collectively,  Viatel ) for cash consideration of  9  2.9   million (or $10  1.2   million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. The acquisition was considered a stock purchase for tax purposes. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received a refund of the purchase price from escrow of  1.3 million (or $1.5 million). The refund is reflected as a cash inflow from investing activities on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 within the Other caption. 

Dallas Data Center Acquisition ( Dallas Data Center )  

On December 31, 2015, the Company acquired a 36,000 square foot data center located in Dallas, Texas for cash consideration of $16.6 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and was considered an asset purchase for tax purposes. 

Acquisition Method Accounting Estimates  

The Company initially recognizes the assets and liabilities acquired from the aforementioned acquisitions based on its preliminary estimates of their acquisition date fair values. As additional information becomes known concerning the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, management may make adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired company up to the end of the measurement period, which is no longer than a one year period following the acquisition date. The determination of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed (and the related determination of estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) requires significant judgment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not completed its fair value analysis and calculations in sufficient detail necessary to arrive at the final estimates of the fair value of certain working capital and non-working capital acquired assets and assumed

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

liabilities, including the allocations to goodwill and intangible assets, deferred revenue and resulting deferred taxes related to its acquisitions of Clearview, Allstream, Viatel and Dallas Data Center. All information presented with respect to certain working capital and non-working capital acquired assets and liabilities assumed as it relates to these acquisitions is preliminary and subject to revision pending the final fair value analysis.  

The table below reflects the Company's estimates of the acquisition date fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed from its Fiscal 2016 acquisitions: 

The goodwill arising from the Company s acquisitions results from synergies, anticipated incremental sales to the acquired company customer base and economies-of-scale expected from the acquisitions. The Company has allocated the goodwill to the reporting units (in existence on the respective acquisition dates) that were expected to benefit from the acquired goodwill. The allocation was determined based on the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed that were assigned to the reporting units. Note 3 -   Goodwill  , displays the allocation of the Company's acquired goodwill to each of its reporting units. 

In the Company s acquisitions, the Company acquired certain customer relationships. These relationships represent a valuable intangible asset, as the Company anticipates continued business from the acquired customer bases. The Company s estimate of the fair value of the acquired customer relationships is based on a multi-period excess earnings valuation technique that utilizes Level 3 inputs. 

Transaction Costs  

Transaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e., legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense, severance expense incurred on the date of acquisition or disposal, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with such acquisitions or disposals.  The Company incurred transaction costs of   $3.0 million and nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Transaction costs have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and in cash flows from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows during these periods.

Term Loan Facility due 2021 and Revolving Credit Facility  

On May 6, 2015, the Company and Zayo Capital, Inc. ( Zayo Capital ) entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement whereby its Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) governing its senior secured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) was amended and restated in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of its outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility to May 6, 2021. The interest rate margins applicable to the Term Loan Facility were decreased by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 2.75% with a minimum LIBOR of 1.0%. In addition, the amended and restated Credit Agreement removed the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and replaced such covenant with a springing senior secured leverage ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver, increased certain lien and debt baskets, and removed certain covenants related to collateral. The terms of the Term Loan Facility require the Company to make quarterly principal payments of $5.1 million plus an annual payment of up to 50% of excess cash flow, as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement (no such payment was required during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015).   

The Revolver matures at the earliest of (i) April 17, 2020 and (ii) six months prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility, subject to amendment thereof. The Credit Agreement also allows for letter of credit commitments of up to $50.0 million. The Revolver is subject to a fee per annum of 0.25% to 0.375% (based on its current leverage ratio) of the weighted-average unused capacity, and the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver are subject to a 0.25% fee per annum. Outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver accrue interest at a rate ranging from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum based upon its leverage ratio. 

On January 15, 2016, the Company entered into an Incremental Amendment (the  Amendment ) to its Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Amendment, the Term Loan Facility was increased by $400.0 million (the  Incremental Term Loan ). The additional amounts borrowed bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.5% with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%. The $400.0 million add-on was priced at 99.0% (the  Term Loan Proceeds ). The issue discount of $4.8 million on the Amendment is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan Facility under the effective interest method. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended. The Term Loan Proceeds were used to fund the Allstream acquisition (see Note 2     Acquisitions  ) and for general corporate purposes. 

On July 22, 2016, we and Zayo Capital entered into a Repricing Amendment (the  Repricing Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement.  Per the terms of the Amendment, the Incremental Term Loan was repriced to bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%, which represented a downward adjustment of 75 basis points. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended. 

The weighted average interest rates (including margins) on the Term Loan Facility were approximately 3.75% and 3.9% at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Interest rates on the Revolver as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were approximately 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $7.9 million as of September 30, 2016, leaving $442.1 million available under the Revolver.  

6.00% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2023 and 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 

On April 14, 2016, we and Zayo Capital completed a private offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2025 Unsecured Notes (the  New 2025 Notes ). The New 2025 Notes were an additional issuance of the existing 6.375% senior unsecured notes due in 2025 (the  2025 Unsecured Notes ) and were priced at 97.1%. The issue discount of $15.9 million of the New 2025 Notes is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the New 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The net proceeds from the offering plus cash on hand (i) were used to redeem the then outstanding $325.6 million 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020, including the required $20.3

million make-whole premium and accrued interest, and (ii) were used to repay $196.0 million of borrowings under the secured Term Loan Facility. Per the terms of the Credit Agreement, the $196.0 million prepayment on the Term Loan Facility relieves the Company of its obligation to make quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan Facility until the cumulative amount of such relieved payments exceeds $196.0 million. The Company recorded a $2.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt discount on the Term Loan Facility accounted for as an extinguishment during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. Following the offering of the New 2025 Notes, $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Unsecured Notes is outstanding.    

Debt covenants  

The indentures (the  Indentures ) governing the 6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the  2023 Unsecured Notes ) and the 2025 Unsecured Notes (collectively the  Notes ) contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to any equity interests, make certain investments or other restricted payments, create liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of the Company s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company, consolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all or substantially all of their assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.  The terms of the Indentures include customary events of default.  

The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including among others, non-payment of principal, interest, or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, insolvency or inability to pay debts, bankruptcy, or a change of control. The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant, applicable only to the Revolver, that the Company maintain a senior secured leverage ratio below 5.25:1.00 at any time when the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolver is greater than 35% of the commitments under the Revolver.   The Credit Agreement also requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, make additional guaranties, incur additional liens on assets, or dispose of assets, pay dividends, or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay certain other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments and amend the terms of certain other indebtedness. 

The Indentures limit any increase in the Company s secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times the Company s previous quarter s annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), and limit the Company s incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 6.00 times the previous quarter s annualized modified EBITDA. 

The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with its debt agreements as of September 30, 2016. 

Guarantees 

The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company s current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries. The Notes were co-issued with Zayo Capital, which does not have independent assets or operations. 

Debt issuance costs  

In connection with the Credit Agreement (and subsequent amendments thereto), and the various Notes offerings, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $90.1 million (net of extinguishments). These costs are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the underlying debt instruments using the effective interest method, unless extinguished earlier, at which time the related unamortized costs are to be immediately expensed.

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Unamortized debt issuance costs of $11.4 million associated with the Company s previous indebtedness were recorded as part of the loss on extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016.  

The balance of debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was $52.1 million and $53.8 million, net of accumulated amortization of $38.0 million and $35.8 million, respectively. The amortization of debt issuance costs is included on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows within the caption  Non-cash interest expense  along with the amortization or accretion of the premium and discount on the Company s indebtedness and changes in the fair value of the Company s interest rate derivatives.    Interest expense associated with the amortization of debt issuance costs was $2.2 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Debt issuance costs are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to  Long-term debt, non-current .  

Interest rate derivatives  

On August 13, 2012, the Company entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $750.0 million, a maturity date of June 30, 2017, and a start date of June 30, 2013. There were no up-front fees for these agreements. The contract states that the Company shall pay a 1.67% fixed rate of interest for the term of the agreement beginning on the start date. The counter-party will pay to the Company the greater of actual LIBOR or 1.25%. The Company entered in to the forward-starting swap arrangements to reduce the risk of increased interest costs associated with potential changes in LIBOR rates. 

Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps are recorded in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the applicable period. The fair value of the interest rate swaps of $2.3  million and $3.0  million are included in  Other long term liabilities  in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , $(0.7) million and $0.4  million was recorded as a (decrease)/increase in interest expense for the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps. 

(6) INCOME TAXES  

The Company s effective tax rates on pre-tax income/(loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 29.8% and 21.6%, respectively. 

The interim period effective tax rate is derived from anticipated pre-tax book income for the full fiscal year adjusted for anticipated items that are deductible/non-deductible for tax purposes only (i.e., permanent items). Additionally, the tax expense or benefit related to discrete permanent differences in an interim period are recorded in the period they occur. 

The interim effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was positively impacted by the United Kingdom ( UK ) tax rate decrease (described further below) as well as non-US tax expense not recognized due to full valuation allowances recorded on certain foreign entities. The effective tax continues to be negatively impacted by stock-based compensation expense related to the common units of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC ( CII ), which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The interim effective tax rate was further negatively impacted by an excess of GAAP stock compensation expense for the current quarter, related to the Company s Restricted Stock Unit plan, over what is deductible for income tax purposes. 

In the UK, the main rate of corporation tax was reduced during the current quarter from 18% to 17%, applicable from April 1, 2020. The Company, in accordance with ASC 740-270-25, is recording the effect of this tax rate change on

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a discrete item in the current interim period. The impact of the change in the UK tax rate in the three months   ended September 30, 2016 was a reduction in the Company s tax effective tax rate of 7.4%. 

(7) EQUITY  

During the three months ended     September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a $24.3 million increase in   member s interest   associated with stock-based compensation expense related to the Company s equity classified stock-based compensation awards (See Note 8     Stock-based Compensation  ).  

(8) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

The following tables summarize the Company s stock-based compensation expense for liability and equity classified awards included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

CII Common Units 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recognized $4.2 million and $19.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to vesting of CII common and preferred units. As of September 30, 2016, the unrecognized compensation associated with the ZGH component of unvested CII common units was $5.9 million. 

Performance Incentive Compensation Plan ( PCIP ) 

During October 2014, ZGH adopted the 2014 Performance Compensation Incentive Plan ( PCIP ).  The PCIP includes incentive cash compensation (ICC) and equity (in the form of restricted stock units or  RSUs ).  Grants under the PCIP RSU plans are made quarterly for all participants. The PCIP was effective on October 16, 2014 and will remain in effect for a period of 10 years (or through October 16, 2024) unless it is earlier terminated by ZGH s Board of Directors. 

16 

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

The PCIP has the following components:  

Part A 

Under Part A of the PCIP, all full-time employees, including the Company s executives, are eligible to earn quarterly awards of RSUs. Each participant in Part A of the PCIP will have a RSU annual award target value, which will be allocated to each fiscal quarter. The final Part A value awarded to a participant for any fiscal quarter is determined by the Compensation Committee subsequent to the end of the respective performance period taking into account ZGH s measured value creation for the quarter, as well as such other subjective factors that it deems relevant (including group and individual level performance factors). The number of Part A RSUs granted will be calculated based on the final award value determined by the Compensation Committee divided by the average closing price of ZGH s common stock over the last ten trading days of the respective performance period. Part A RSUs will   vest assuming continuous employment fifteen months subsequent to the end of the performance period. Upon vesting, the RSUs convert to an equal number of shares of ZGH s common stock. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $21.3 million   and $10.0 million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with the vested portion of the Part A awards. The September 2016   and June 2016 quarterly awards were recorded as liabilities totaling $3.3 million and $2.0 million, as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, as the awards represent an obligation denominated in a fixed dollar amount to be settled in a variable number of shares during the subsequent quarter.    The quarterly stock-based compensation liability is included in  Other long-term liabilities  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.   Upon the issuance of the RSUs, the liability is re-measured and then reclassified to member s interest, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock based compensation expense. The value of the remaining unvested RSUs is expensed ratably through the vesting date. At September 30, 2016, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost to be expensed over the remaining vesting period for Part A awards is $29.7 million. 

The following table summarizes the Company s Part A RSU activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

Part B 

Under Part B of the PCIP, participants, including the Company s executives, are awarded quarterly grants of RSUs. The number of the RSUs earned by the participants is based on ZGH s stock price performance over a performance period of one year with the starting price being the average closing price over the last ten trading days of the quarter immediately prior to the grant and vest, assuming continuous employment through the end of the measurement period. The existence of a vesting provision that is associated with the performance of ZGH s stock price is a market condition, which affects the determination of the grant date fair value.  Upon vesting, RSUs earned convert to an equal number of shares of ZGH s common stock.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

The following table summarizes the Company s Part B RSU activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

The table below reflects the total Part B RSUs granted during Fiscal 2017 and 2016, the maximum eligible shares of ZGH s stock that the respective Part B RSU grant could be converted into shares of ZGH s common stock, and the grant date fair value per Part B RSU: 

The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $6.2 million and $16.4 million related to Part B awards for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The grant date fair value of Part B RSU grants is estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation.  This simulation estimates the ten-day average closing stock price ending on the vesting date, the stock price performance over the performance period, and the number of common shares to be issued at the vesting date. Various assumptions are utilized in the valuation method, including the target stock price performance ranges and respective share payout percentages, the Company s historical stock price performance and volatility, peer companies  historical volatility and an appropriate risk-free rate. The aggregate future value of the grant under each simulation is calculated using the estimated per share value of the common stock at the end of the vesting period multiplied by the number of common shares projected to be granted at the vesting date. The present value of the aggregate grant is then calculated under each of the simulations, resulting in a distribution of potential present values. The fair value of the grant is then calculated based on the average of the potential present values. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with Part B RSU grants is $14.4 million at September 30, 2016. 

Part C 

Under Part C of the PCIP, independent directors of ZGH are eligible to receive quarterly awards of RSUs.  Independent directors electing to receive a portion of their annual director fees in the form of RSUs are granted a set dollar amount of Part C RSUs each quarter.  The quantity of Part C RSUs granted is based on the average closing price of ZGH s common stock over the last ten trading days of the quarter ended immediately prior to the grant date and vest at the end of each quarter for which the grant was made.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the   

18 

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Company s independent directors were granted 10,611 Part C RSUs. Part C RSUs vest in the same quarter that they are issued. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized $0.3 million and   $0.2   million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with the Part C RSUs. 

(9) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable, interest rate swaps, long-term debt, certain post-employment plans and stock-based compensation liability. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 due to the short maturity of these instruments.  

The carrying value of the Company s Notes, excluding debt issuance costs, reflects the original amounts borrowed, inclusive of net unamortized discount, and was $2,320.8 million and $2,320.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Based on market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of the Company's Notes as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was estimated to be $2,460.0 million and $2,338.1 million, respectively. The Company s fair value estimates associated with its Note obligations were derived utilizing Level 2 inputs   quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. 

The carrying value of the Company s Term Loan Facility, excluding debt issuance costs, reflects the original amounts borrowed, inclusive of unamortized discounts, and was $1,819.4 million and $1,818.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company s Term Loan Facility accrues interest at variable rates based upon the one month, three month or six month LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) plus a spread of 2.75%. Since management does not believe that the Company s credit quality has changed significantly since the date when the Term Loan Facility was last amended on May 6, 2015, its carrying amount approximates fair value. Excluding any offsetting effect of the Company s interest rate swaps, a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on the Company s Term Loan Facility of one percentage point above the 1.0% LIBOR floor would increase the Company s annual interest expense by approximately $18.4 million. 

The Company s interest rate swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques that use observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, forward rates, and credit ratings. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps of $(0.7) million   and $0.4 million were recorded as a (decrease)/increase to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   A hypothetical increase in LIBOR rates of 100 basis points would favorably increase the fair value of the interest rate swaps by approximately $3.9 million. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there was no balance outstanding under the Company's Revolver. 

Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

(10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Purchase commitments  

At September 30, 2016, the Company was contractually committed for $296.0 million of capital expenditures for construction materials and purchases of property and equipment. A majority of these purchase commitments are expected to be satisfied in the next twelve months. These purchase commitments are primarily success based; that is, the Company has executed customer contracts that support the future capital expenditures.

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Contingencies  

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various outstanding legal proceedings, asserted and unasserted claims, and carrier disputes. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, both asserted and unasserted, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  

(11) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

In May 2016, CII sold Onvoy, LLC and its subsidiaries ( OVS ) to an entity that has a material ownership interest in the Company. The Company continues to have ongoing contractual relationships with OVS, whereby the Company provides OVS and its subsidiaries with bandwidth capacity and OVS provides the Company and its subsidiaries with voice services. The contractual relationships are based on agreements that were entered into at estimated market rates.  

The following table represents the revenue and expense transactions the Company recorded with OVS for the periods presented:  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding balances due from OVS. 

Dan Caruso, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is a party to an aircraft charter (or membership) agreement through his affiliate, Bear Equity LLC, for business and personal travel.  Under the terms of the charter agreement, all fees for the use of the aircraft are effectively variable in nature. For his business travel on behalf of the Company, Mr. Caruso is reimbursed for his use of the aircraft subject to an annual maximum reimbursement threshold approved by the Company's Nominating and Governance Committee. During   the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company reimbursed Mr. Caruso $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for his business use of the aircraft.  

(12) SEGMENT REPORTING  

The Company uses the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented separately in the Company's notes to its financial statements. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. 

As the Company has increased in scope and scale, it has developed its management and reporting structure to support this growth. The Company s dark fiber solutions, network connectivity, colocation and cloud infrastructure, Zayo Canada and other services are comprised of various related product groups generally defined around the type of service the customer is buying, referred to as Strategic Product Groups ("SPG" or "SPGs"). Each SPG is responsible for the revenue, costs and associated capital expenditures of their respective services. The SPGs enable sales, make pricing and product decisions, engineer networks and deliver services to customers, and support customers for their specific telecom and Internet infrastructure services. 

With the continued increase in the Company s scope and scale, effective October 1, 2015 the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), the Company's Chief Executive Officer, implemented certain organizational   

20 

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

changes to the management and operation of the business that directly impacts how the CODM makes resource allocation decisions and manages the Company. The change in structure had the impact of establishing a new reportable segment and re-aligning the Company s existing SPGs to the revised reportable segments.  Prior to this change, the operating segments were reported as Physical Infrastructure, which included the Company s Dark Fiber, MIG and zColo SPGs, Cloud and Connectivity, which included the Company s Waves, SONET, Ethernet, IP and Cloud SPGs, and Other, which primarily included ZPS.  The new structure has moved the zColo and Cloud SPGs out of the Physical Infrastructure and Cloud and Connectivity reporting segments, respectively, creating a new reportable segment named Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure. The Dark Fiber and MIG SPGs are now reported in the Dark Fiber Solutions operating segment, and Ethernet, IP, Waves, and SONET SPGs, are now reported in the Network Connectivity operating segment. SPGs report directly to the reportable segment managers who are responsible for the operations and financial results for the Dark Fiber Solutions, Network Connectivity, Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure, and Other reportable segments (collectively, the  Revised Segments ). The segment managers report directly to the CODM, and it is the financial results of those segments that are evaluated and drive the resource allocation decisions made by the CODM. 

The Company s segments are further described below: 

Dark Fiber Solutions  . Through the Dark Fiber Solutions segment, the Company provides raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber and mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. The Company leases dark fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to its customers, who  light  the fiber using their own optronics. The Company s mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. Dark Fiber Solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms in the Dark Fiber Solutions segment tend to range from three to twenty years. 

Network Connectivity  . The Network Connectivity segment provides bandwidth infrastructure solutions over the Company s metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks where it uses optronics to light the fiber and the Company s customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. The Company s services within this segment include wavelength, Ethernet, IP and SONET. The Company targets customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Network Connectivity customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. 

Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure  . The Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure segment provides data center infrastructure solutions to a broad range of enterprise, carrier, content and cloud customers. The Company s services within this segment include colocation, interconnection, cloud, hosting and managed services, such as security and remote hands offerings. Solutions range in size from single cabinet and server support to comprehensive international outsourced IT infrastructure environments. The Company s data centers also support a large component of the Company s networking equipment for the purpose of aggregating and distributing data, voice, Internet, and video traffic. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years 

Zayo Canada  . The Zayo Canada segment is comprised of the recently acquired business of Allstream (see Note 2     Acquisitions  ). The services provided by this segment include legacy dark fiber, network connectivity, cloud and colocation infrastructure, voice, unified communications, managed security services and small and medium businesses ( SMB ) of Allstream.  Voice provides a full range of local voice services allowing business customers to complete telephone calls in their local exchange, as well as make long distance, toll-free and related calls. Unified communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as telephony (including IP telephony), instant messaging and video conferencing with non-  

21 

Table of Contents  

ZAYO GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

real-time communication services, such as integrated voicemail and e-mail.  Unified communications provides a set of products that give users the ability to work and communicate across multiple devices, media types and geographies. Managed security services provide proactive services and solutions designed to enable organizations to operate in an environment of constantly evolving threats from organized cyber-crime. The service provides real-time threat analysis and correlation of information security threats, response and mitigations services, secure access to the internet and the cloud, information risk and compliance services, and management of the IT security envelope.  Zayo Canada provides services to over 26,000 customers in the SMB market while leveraging its extensive network and product offerings. These include IP, internet, voice, IP trunking, cloud private branch exchange, collaboration services and unified communications. 

Other  . The Other segment is primarily comprised of ZPS. ZPS provides network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage our expertise in designing, acquiring and maintaining networks. Services are typically provided for a term of one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). 

Revenues for all of the Company s products are included in one of the Company s segments. The segment presentation has been recast for all prior periods presented for comparability. The results of operations for each segment include an allocation of certain indirect costs and corporate related costs, including overhead and third party-financed debt. The allocation is based on a percentage that represents management s estimate of the relative burden each segment bears of indirect and corporate costs. Management has evaluated the allocation methods utilized to allocate these costs and determined they are systematic, rational and consistently applied. Identifiable assets for each reportable segment are reconciled to total consolidated assets including unallocated corporate assets and intersegment eliminations. Unallocated corporate assets consist primarily of cash and deferred taxes.  

Segment Adjusted EBITDA  

Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company s CODM to evaluate segment operating performance.  

The Company defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA as earnings/(loss) from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains/(losses) on intercompany loans, and non-cash income/(loss) on equity and cost method investments. The Company uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods. The Company believes that the presentation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and facilitates comparison of the Company s results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. 

Segment Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by the Company and its Compensation Committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to employees. 

Segment Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company s results from operations and operating cash flows as reported under GAAP. For example, Segment Adjusted EBITDA:

Our fiscal year ends June 30 each year, and we refer to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 as  Fiscal 2017  and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as  Fiscal 2016.  

We are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.  

Our Segments  

We use the management approach to determine the segment financial information that should be disaggregated and presented. The management approach is based on the manner by which management has organized the segments within the Company for making operating decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance. As of September 30, 2016, we have five reportable segments as described below:  

Dark Fiber Solutions  . Through the Dark Fiber Solutions segment, we provide raw bandwidth infrastructure to customers that require more control of their internal networks. These services include dark fiber and mobile infrastructure (fiber-to-the-tower and small cell). Dark fiber is a physically separate and secure, private platform for dedicated bandwidth. We lease dark fiber pairs (usually 2 to 12 total fibers) to our customers, who  light  the fiber using their own optronics. Our mobile infrastructure services provide direct fiber connections to cell towers, small cells, hub sites, and mobile switching centers. Dark Fiber Solutions customers include carriers and other communication service providers, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, major media and content companies, large enterprises, and other companies that have the expertise to run their own fiber optic networks or require interconnected technical space. The contract terms in the Dark Fiber Solutions segment tend to range from three to twenty years.  

Network Connectivity  . The Network Connectivity segment provides bandwidth infrastructure solutions over our metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks where it uses optronics to light the fiber and our customers pay for access based on the amount and type of bandwidth they purchase. Our services within this segment include wavelength, Ethernet, IP and SONET. We target customers who require a minimum of 10G of bandwidth across their networks. Network Connectivity customers include carriers, financial services companies, healthcare, government institutions, education institutions and other enterprises. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years.  

Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure  . The Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure segment provides data center infrastructure solutions to a broad range of enterprise, carrier, content and cloud customers. The Company s services within this segment include colocation, interconnection, cloud, hosting and managed services, such as security and remote hands offerings. Solutions range in size from single cabinet and server support to comprehensive international outsourced IT infrastructure environments. The Company s data centers also support a large component of the Company s networking equipment for the purpose of aggregating and distributing data, voice, Internet, and video traffic. The contract terms in this segment tend to range from two to five years. 

Zayo Canada  . The Zayo Canada segment is comprised of the recently acquired business of Allstream, Inc. and Allstream Fiber U.S. Inc. (together,  Allstream ). The services provided by this segment include legacy dark fiber, network connectivity, cloud and colocation infrastructure, voice, unified communications, managed security services and small and medium businesses ( SMB ) of Allstream.  Voice provides a full range of local voice services allowing business customers to complete telephone calls in their local exchange, as well as make long distance, toll-free and related calls. Unified communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as telephony (including IP telephony), instant messaging and video conferencing with non-real-time communication services, such as integrated voicemail and e-mail.  Unified communications provides a set of products that give users the ability to work and communicate across multiple devices, media types and geographies. Managed security services provide proactive services and solutions designed to enable organizations to operate in an environment of constantly evolving threats from organized cyber-crime. The service provides real-time threat analysis and correlation of information security threats, response and mitigations services, secure access to the internet and the cloud, information risk and compliance services, and management of the IT security envelope.  Zayo Canada provides services to over 26,000 customers in the SMB market while leveraging its extensive network and product offerings. These include IP, internet, voice, IP trunking, cloud private branch exchange, collaboration services and unified communications.

O  ther.      Our Other segment is primarily comprised of ZPS. Through our professional services ZPS Strategic Product Group, we provide network and technical resources to customers who wish to leverage our expertise in designing, acquiring and maintaining networks.  Services are typically provided for a term of one year for a fixed recurring monthly fee in the case of network and on an hourly basis for technical resources (usage revenue). 

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations  

Business Acquisitions  

We were founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the ongoing demand for bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry. These trends have continued in the years since our founding, despite volatile economic conditions, and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on those trends. We have built a significant portion of our network and service offerings through 38 acquisitions through September 30, 2016.  

As a result of the growth of our business from these acquisitions, and capital expenditures and the increased debt used to fund those investing activities, our results of operations for the respective periods presented and discussed herein are not comparable.  

Recent Acquisitions 

Clearview 

On April 1, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity interest in Clearview International, LLC, a Texas based colocation and cloud infrastructure services provider, for cash consideration of $18.3 million.  The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. 

The acquisition consisted of two Texas data centers. The data centers, located at 6606 LBJ Freeway in Dallas, Texas and 700 Austin Avenue in Waco, Texas, added approximately 30,000 square feet of colocation space, as well as a set of hybrid cloud infrastructure services that complement our global cloud capabilities.    

The results of the acquired Clearview business are included in our operating results beginning April 1, 2016. 

Allstream 

On January 15, 2016, we acquired 100% of the equity interest in Allstream, Inc. and Allstream Fiber U.S. Inc. for cash consideration of CAD $422.9 million (or $297.6 million), net of cash acquired, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The consideration paid is net of CAD $42.1 million (or $29.6 million) of working capital and other liabilities assumed by us in the acquisition. The acquisition was funded with an incremental borrowing under our Term Loan Facility (as defined below). 

The acquisition added more than 18,000 route miles to our fiber network, including 12,500 miles of long-haul fiber connecting all major Canadian markets and 5,500 route miles of metro fiber network connecting approximately 3,300 on-net buildings concentrated in Canada s top five metropolitan markets. 

The operating results of the acquired Allstream business are included in our operating results beginning January 15, 2016. 

Viatel 

On December 31, 2015, we acquired 100% of the interest in Viatel Infrastructure Europe Ltd, Viatel (UK) Limited, Viatel France SAS, Viatel Deutschland GmbH and Viatel Nederland BV (collectively  Viatel ) for cash consideration of  92.9 million (or $101.2 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.    

34 

Table of Contents  

The Viatel acquisition provides us with Pan-European intercity and metro fiber capability via a 8,400 kilometer fiber network across eight countries. The transaction added 12 new metro networks, seven data centers and connectivity to 81 on-net buildings. Two wholly-owned subsea cable systems provide connectivity on two of Europe s key routes   London-Amsterdam and London-Paris. 

The operating results of the acquired Viatel business are included in our results beginning January 1, 2016. 

Dallas Data Center 

On December 31, 2015, the Company acquired a 36,000 square foot data center located in Dallas, Texas for cash consideration of $16.6 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.  

The operating results of the acquired Dallas Data Center business are included in our results beginning January 1, 2016. 

Substantial Indebtedness 

Term Loan Facility due 2021 and Revolving Credit Facility 

On May 6, 2015, we and Zayo Capital, Inc. ( Zayo Capital ) entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement whereby the Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) governing the senior secured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ) was amended and restated in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility to May 6, 2021. The interest rate margins applicable to the Term Loan Facility were decreased by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 2.75% with a minimum LIBOR of 1.0%. In addition, the amended and restated Credit Agreement removed the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and replaced such covenant with a springing senior secured leverage ratio maintenance requirement applicable only to the Revolver, increased certain lien and debt baskets, and removed certain covenants related to collateral. The terms of the Term Loan Facility require us to make quarterly principal payments of $5.1 million plus an annual payment of up to 50% of excess cash flow, as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement (no such payment was required during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015). 

The Revolver matures at the earliest of (i) April 17, 2020 and (ii) six months prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility, subject to amendment thereof.  The Credit Agreement also allows for letter of credit commitments of up to $50.0 million.  The Revolver is subject to a fee per annum of 0.25% to 0.375% (based on our current leverage ratio) of the weighted-average unused capacity, and the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver are subject to a 0.25% fee per annum. Outstanding letters of credit backed by the Revolver accrue interest at a rate ranging from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 3.0% per annum based upon our leverage ratio. 

On January 15, 2016, we and Zayo Capital entered into an Incremental Amendment (the  Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of     the Amendment, the Term Loan Facility was increased by $400.0 million (the  Incremental Term Loan ). The additional amounts borrowed bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.5% with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%. The $400.0 million add-on was priced at 99.0% (the  Term Loan Proceeds ). The issue discount of $4.8 million on the Amendment is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan Facility under the effective interest method. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended.  The Term Loan Proceeds were used to fund the Allstream acquisition (see Note 2     Acquisitions  ) and for general corporate purposes. 

On July 22, 2016, we and Zayo Capital entered into a Repricing Amendment (the  Repricing Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement.  Per the terms of the Amendment, the Incremental Term Loan was repriced to bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.0%, which represented a downward adjustment of 75 basis points. No other terms of the Credit Agreement were amended. 

35 

Table of Contents  

The weighted average interest rates (including margins) on the Term Loan Facility were approximately 3.75% and 3.9% at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Interest rates on the Revolver as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were approximately 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver. Standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of $7.9 million as of September 30, 2016, leaving $442.1 million available under the Revolver. 

6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 

On April 14, 2016, we and Zayo Capital closed a private offering (the  Additional 2025 Notes Offering ) of an additional $550.0 million of the 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the  2025 Unsecured Notes ) priced at 97.1%, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds for the Additional 2025 Unsecured Notes of $534.1 million.  The issue discount of $15.9 million on the Additional 2025 Notes Offering is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Unsecured Notes using the effective interest method. Interest on the 2025 Unsecured Notes is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2015. The 2025 Unsecured Notes will mature on May 15, 2025.     The net proceeds of the Additional 2025 Notes Offering plus cash on hand were used to (i) repay approximately $196.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) redeem the then outstanding $325.6 million 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020, including the required make-whole premium and accrued interest.      Per the terms of the Credit Agreement, the $196.0 million prepayment on the Term Loan Facility relieves the Company of its obligation to make quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan Facility until the cumulative amount of such relieved payments exceeds $196.0 million.      As a result of the redemption, we recorded a $2.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the write-off of unamortized debt discount on the Term Loan Facility during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016.   

Capital Expenditures  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we invested $208.3 million and $159.2 million, respectively, in capital expenditures primarily to expand our fiber network to support new customer contracts. We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures in future periods.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Background for Review of Our Results of Operations  

Revenue  

Our revenue is comprised predominately of monthly recurring revenue ( MRR ). MRR is related to an ongoing service that is generally fixed in price and paid by the customer on a monthly basis. We also report monthly amortized revenue ( MAR ), which represents the amortization of previously collected upfront charges to customers. Upfront charges are typically related to indefeasible rights of use ( IRUs ) structured as pre-payments rather than monthly recurring payments (though we structure IRUs as both prepaid and recurring, largely dependent on the customers  preference) and installation fees. The last category of revenue we report is other revenue. Other revenue primarily includes credits and adjustments, termination revenue, construction services, and equipment sales. 

Our consolidated reported revenue in any given period is a function of our beginning revenue under contract and the impact of organic growth and acquisition activity. Our organic activity is driven by net new sales ( bookings ), gross installed revenue ( installs ) and churn processed ( churn ) as further described below. 

Net New Sales  .   Net new sales ( bookings ) represent the dollar amount of orders, to be recorded as MRR and MAR upon installation, in a period that have been signed by the customer and accepted by our service delivery organization. The dollar value of bookings is equal to the monthly recurring price that the customer will pay for the   

36 

Table of Contents  

services and/or the monthly amortized amount of the revenue that we will recognize for those services. To the extent a booking is cancelled by the customer prior to it being installed, it is subtracted from the total bookings number in the period that it is cancelled. Bookings do not immediately impact revenue until they are installed (gross installed revenue). 

Gross Installed Revenue  .   Installs are the amount of MRR and MAR for services that have been installed, tested, accepted by the customer, and have been recognized in revenue during a given period.   Installs include new services, price increases, and upgrades. 

Churn Processed  .   Churn is any negative change to MRR and MAR. Churn includes disconnects, negative price changes, and disconnects associated with upgrades or replacement services. For each period presented, disconnects associated with attrition and upgrades or replacement services are the drivers of churn, accounting for more than 80% of negative changes in MRR and MAR while price changes account for less than 20%. Monthly churn is also presented as a percentage of MRR and MAR ( churn percentage ). 

Given the size and amount of acquisitions we have completed, we have estimated the revenue growth rate associated with our organic activity in each period reported. Our estimated organic growth rate is calculated as if acquisitions closed during the periods presented were closed on the first day of the earliest period presented within this Quarterly Report.   In calculating this pro-forma growth figure we add the revenue recorded by the  acquired companies  (including estimated purchase accounting adjustments) for the reporting periods prior to the date of inclusion in our results of operations, and then calculating the growth rate between the two reported periods.      The estimated pro-forma revenue growth rates  are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated on the first day of the earliest period presented.  As we conduct operations outside of the United States of America and have historically acquired companies with functional currencies other than the United States Dollar ( USD ), the estimated pro-forma revenue growth rates may not adequately reflect operational performance as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.   

We have foreign subsidiaries that enter into contracts with customers and vendors in currencies other than the USD   principally the Pound Sterling ( GBP ) and Canadian Dollar ( CAD ) and to a lesser extent the Euro and Swiss Franc ( CHF ). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenue and expenses each period. The comparisons excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates assume exchange rates remained constant at the comparative period rate. 

Operating Costs and Expenses 

Our operating costs and expenses consist of network expense ( Netex ), compensation and benefits, network operations expense ( Netops ), stock-based compensation expense, other expenses, and depreciation and amortization. 

Netex consists of third-party network service costs resulting from our leasing of certain network facilities, primarily leases of circuits and dark fiber, from carriers to augment our owned infrastructure, for which we are generally billed a fixed monthly fee. Netex also includes colocation facility costs for rent and license fees paid to the landlords of the buildings in which our colocation business operates, along with the utility costs to power those facilities. While increases in demand for our services will drive additional operating costs in our business, consistent with our strategy of leveraging our owned infrastructure assets, we expect to primarily utilize our existing network infrastructure or build new network infrastructure to meet the demand. In limited circumstances, we will augment our network with additional circuits or services from third-party providers. Third-party network service costs include the upfront cost of the initial installation of such circuits. Such costs are included in operating costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations over the respective service period. 

Compensation and benefits expenses include salaries, wages, incentive compensation and benefits. Employee-related costs that are directly associated with network construction, service installations (and development of business support systems) are capitalized and amortized to operating costs and expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses related to the departments attributed to generating revenue are included in our operating costs line item while compensation and benefits expenses related to the sales, product, and corporate departments are included in our selling, general and administrative expenses line item of our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

37 

Table of Contents  

Netops expense includes all of the non-personnel related expenses of operating and maintaining our network infrastructure, including contracted maintenance fees, right-of-way costs, rent for cellular towers and other places where fiber is located, pole attachment fees, and relocation expenses. Such costs are included in operating costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Stock-based compensation expense is included, based on the responsibilities of the awarded recipient, in either our operating costs or selling, general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Other expenses include expenses such as property tax, franchise fees, colocation facility maintenance, travel, office expense and other administrative costs. Other expenses are included in both operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses depending on their relationship to generating revenue or association with sales and administration.  

Transaction costs include expenses associated with professional services (i.e. legal, accounting, regulatory, etc.) rendered in connection with acquisitions or disposals (including spin-offs), travel expense, severance expense incurred on the date of acquisition or disposal, and other direct expenses incurred that are associated with signed and/or closed acquisitions or disposals. Transaction costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

* not meaningful 

Our total revenue increased by $138.1 million, or 38%, to $504.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $366.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue was driven by our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions as well as organic growth.  

We estimate that the period-over-period pro-forma revenue growth was approximately 2.5%. Our estimated pro-forma growth was driven by installs that exceeded churn over the course of both periods, resulting from continued strong demand for bandwidth infrastructure services broadly across our service territory and customer verticals offset by the impact of the strengthening of the USD.  The average exchange rate between the USD strengthened against the GBP by 15.3% and the exchange rates between the USD and Euro and USD and CAD weakened by 0.3% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   Normalizing our estimated pro-forma revenue growth to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we estimate that pro-forma revenue would have increased between the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 by an additional $4.4 million for a total period-over-period pro-forma revenue growth of 3.4%.  

Additional underlying revenue drivers included:  

Bookings increased period over period to $8.2 million from $6.4 million in combined MRR and MAR. The total contract value associated with bookings, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $562.1 million.

Dark Fiber Solutions  .   Revenue from our Dark Fiber Solutions segment increased by $13.4 million, or 10%, to $148.4 million from $135.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Dark Fiber is the largest SPG within the segment and benefited from continued growth in infrastructure demand. Our Mobile Infrastructure products also contributed to the segment s growth. Bookings of MRR and MAR for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.5 million (with a total contract value of approximately $421.8 million), an increase from the $2.0 million in bookings for the same period in the prior year. Gross installs remained consistent at $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The monthly churn percentage remained consistent between the two periods at 0.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, with total churn processed of $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Network Connectivity  .   Revenue from our Network Connectivity segment increased by $8.6 million, or 5%, to $175.6 million from $167.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was a result of both organic and acquisition related growth. 

Growth was strongest in the segment s Waves SPG, driven by customer demand and increased effectiveness in marketing these products, including price concessions that were proactively offered in exchange for customer contract extensions in Fiscal 2016. SONET is a legacy product, and its revenue declined between the two periods, consistent with our expectations. 

Bookings of MRR and MAR increased to $3.6 million from $3.4 million between the two comparative periods, with a total contract value of approximately $105.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Gross installs were $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The monthly churn percentage increased from 1.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 1.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, with a total churn processed of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure  .   Revenue from our Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure segment increased by $5.8 million, or 10%, to $64.1 million from $58.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was a result of both acquisition related and organic growth. 

zColo is the largest SPG within the segment and benefited from continued growth in infrastructure demand. Bookings of MRR and MAR increased to $1.1 million from $0.9 million between the two comparative periods, with a total contract value of approximately $34.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Gross installs were $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.7 million in the prior year. The monthly churn percentage decreased from 1.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 1.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in total churn processed of $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Other  .   Revenue from our Other segment decreased by $1.9 million, or 29%, to $4.6 million from $6.5 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The drop in revenue from the Other segment was primarily driven by fewer equipment sales. The Other segment represented approximately 1% of our total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

The following table reflects the stratification of our revenues during these periods. The substantial majority of our revenue continued to come from recurring payments from customers under contractual arrangements. 

Operating Costs and Expenses  

* not meaningful 

Our operating costs increased by $103.2 million, or 33%, to $417.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $314.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in consolidated operating costs was primarily due to a $21.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization and other increased costs as a result of our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions and organic growth of our network, offset by a $14.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation. 

Dark Fiber Solutions  .    Dark Fiber Solutions operating costs increased by $5.4 million, or 5%, to $117.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $111.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of a $9.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization and other increased costs as a result of Fiscal 2016 acquisitions and organic growth of our network, offset by a $5.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation. 

Network Connectivity  .    Network Connectivity operating costs increased by $1.2 million, or 1%, to $134.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $133.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of a $3.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization and other increased costs as a result of Fiscal 2016 acquisitions and organic growth of our network, offset by a $7.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation.  

Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure  .    Colocation and Cloud Infrastructure operating costs decreased by $2.2 million, or 3%, to $62.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $64.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating costs and expenses was primarily a result of a $2.7 million decrease  in stock-based compensation, offset by a $1.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. 

Other.      Other operating costs decreased to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was directly attributed to a decrease in revenue associated with equipment sales.

Netex  .    Our Netex increased by $42.7 million, or 84%, to $93.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $50.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Netex was primarily due to increased facility costs related to the colocation acquisitions completed in Fiscal 2016, partially offset by cost savings, as planned network related synergies were realized.  

Compensation and Benefits Expenses  .    Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $24.3 million, or 61%, to $63.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $39.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The increase in compensation and benefits expenses reflected the increase in headcount during Fiscal 2017 to support our growing business, including certain employees retained from businesses acquired during Fiscal 2016, and was partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense.  

Headcount as of the end of the respective periods was: 

Network Operations Expenses  .    Network operations expenses increased by $16.4 million, or 41%, to $56.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $39.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase principally reflected the growth of our network assets and the related expenses of operating that expanded network. Our total network route miles increased approximately 31% to 114,492 miles at September 30, 2016 from 87,273 miles at September 30, 2015. 

Other Expenses  .    Other expenses increased by $9.5 million, or 44%, to $31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of additional expenses attributable to our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions.

Transaction Costs  .   We recognized $3.0 million in transaction costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016  associated with our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions. We did not incur transaction costs during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Stock-Based Compensation  .    Stock-based compensation expense decreased by $14.1 million, or 31%, to $32.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily driven by certain tranches of the Company s pre-IPO common unit grants becoming fully vested prior to the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of post-IPO RSU grants vesting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $21.4 million, or 18%, to $138.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $117.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily a result of depreciation related to increased capital expenditures and increased amortization expense associated with our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions.     

Total Other Expense, Net  

The table below sets forth the components of our total other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Interest expense  .   Interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 1%, to $53.3 million from $53.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily a result of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps, and reduced interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness as a result of our Fiscal 2016 debt transactions, partially offset by an increase in indebtedness from the comparative period. 

Foreign currency loss on intercompany loans  .   Foreign currency loss on intercompany loans increased $0.5 million, or 5%, to an $11.2 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from a loss of $10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This non-cash loss was driven by the strengthening of the USD against the GBP period-over-period and the related impact on intercompany loans entered into by foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency. 

Provision for Income Taxes  

The Company s effective tax rates on pre-tax income/(loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 29.8% and 21.6%, respectively. 

The interim period effective tax rate is derived from anticipated pre-tax book income or loss for the full fiscal year adjusted for anticipated items that are deductible/non- deductible for tax purposes only (i.e., permanent items). Additionally, the tax expense or benefit related to discrete permanent differences in an interim period are recorded in the period they occur. 

42 

Table of Contents  

The interim effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was positively impacted by the United Kingdom ( UK ) tax rate decrease (described further below) as well as non-US tax expense not recognized due to full valuation allowances recorded on certain foreign entities. The effective tax continues to be negatively impacted by stock-based compensation expense related to the common units of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The interim effective tax rate was further negatively impacted by an excess of GAAP stock compensation expense for the current quarter, related to the Company s Restricted Stock Unit plan, over what is deductible for income tax purposes. 

In the UK, the main rate of corporation tax was reduced during the current quarter from 18% to 17%, applicable from April 1, 2020. The Company, in accordance with ASC 740-270-25, is recording the effect of this tax rate change on its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a discrete item in the current interim period. The impact of the change in the UK tax rate in the three months   ended September 30, 2016 was a reduction in the Company s tax effective tax rate of 7.4%. 

Adjusted EBITDA  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings/(loss) from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) adjusted to exclude acquisition or disposal-related transaction costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains/(losses) on intercompany loans, and non-cash income/(loss) on equity and cost method investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting for future periods. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and facilitates comparison of our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures.  

We also monitor Adjusted EBITDA because our subsidiaries have debt covenants that restrict their borrowing capacity that are based on a leverage ratio, which utilizes a modified EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding Notes. The modified EBITDA is consistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the quarter for which the debt compliance certification is due.  

Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to employees.  

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:  

does not reflect capital expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments;      

does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;      

does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on our debt; and      

does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.      

Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.

Reconciliations from segment and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from operations are as follows:  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, equity contributions, and incurrence of debt. Our principal uses of cash have been for acquisitions, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service.  

We have financial covenants under the indentures governing our Notes and our Credit Agreement that, under certain circumstances, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The indentures governing the 2023 Unsecured Notes and the 2025 Unsecured Notes limit any increase in our secured indebtedness (other than certain forms of secured indebtedness expressly permitted under such indentures) to a pro forma secured debt ratio of 4.50 times our previous quarter s annualized modified EBITDA (as defined in the indentures), and limit our incurrence of additional indebtedness to a total indebtedness ratio of 6.00 times the previous quarter s annualized modified EBITDA.  The Credit Agreement also contains a covenant, applicable only to the Revolver, that we maintain a senior secured leverage ratio below 5.25:1.00 at any time when the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolver is greater than 35% of the commitments under the Revolver. The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, make additional guaranties, incur additional liens on assets, or dispose of assets, pay dividends, or make other distributions, voluntarily prepay certain other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliated persons, make investments and amend the terms of certain other indebtedness. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including among others, non-payment of principal, interest, or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, insolvency or inability to pay debts, bankruptcy, or a change of control. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $192.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $99.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held in bank accounts and highly-liquid U.S. treasury money market funds.  Although we had a working capital deficit at September 30, 2016, a substantial portion of the   

44 

Table of Contents  

deficit is a result of a current deferred revenue balance of $126.8 million that we will be recognizing as revenue over the next twelve months. The actual cash outflows associated with fulfilling this deferred revenue obligation during the next twelve months will be significantly less than the September 30, 2016 current deferred revenue balance. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, we had $442.1 million available under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions.  

Our capital expenditures increased by $49.1 million, or 31%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $208.3 million from $159.2 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is a result of meeting the needs of our larger customer base resulting from our acquisitions and organic growth. We expect to continue to invest in our network for the foreseeable future. These capital expenditures, however, are expected to primarily be success-based; that is, in most situations, we will not invest the capital until we have an executed customer contract that supports the investment.  

As part of our corporate strategy, we continue to be regularly involved in discussions regarding potential acquisitions of companies and assets, some of which may be quite large. We expect to fund such acquisitions with cash from operations, debt issuances (including available borrowings under our $450.0 million Revolver), and available cash on hand. We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may refinance existing debt, issue new debt through the capital markets, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity.  

Cash Flows  

We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, in addition to cash and cash equivalents currently on-hand, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, and in any event for at least the next 12 to 18 months. Given the generally volatile global economic climate, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.  

We regularly consider acquisitions and additional strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions, which may require additional debt or equity financing. 

The following table sets forth components of our cash flow for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $37.5 million, or 19%, to $232.7 million from $195.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 include our net income of $15.7 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net income, principally depreciation and amortization of $138.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $32.0 million, foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $11.2 million, non-cash interest expense of $2.6 million and deferred income taxes of $4.8 million. Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $40.9 million, partially offset by amortization of deferred revenue of $27.5 million.  Cash flow during the period was increased by the net change in working capital components of $13.3 million.  

Net cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015 include the loss from operations of $15.2 million, plus the add backs of non-cash items deducted in the determination of net loss, principally depreciation and amortization of $117.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $46.1 million, foreign currency loss on intercompany loans of $10.7 million, non-cash cash interest expense of $3.5 million and deferred income taxes of

Table of Contents  

$2.0 million offset by an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of $7.9 million.  Also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities were additions to deferred revenue of $49.7 million, less amortization of deferred revenue of $20.4 million.  Cash flow during the period was increased by the net change in working capital components of $8.8 million.   

The increase in net cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily a result of additional earnings and synergies realized from our Fiscal 2016 acquisitions, and a $16.1 million decrease in cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest and organic growth. 

Cash Flows used in Investing Activities  

We used cash in investing activities of $206.8 million and $159.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our uses of cash for investing activities were primarily related to additions to property and equipment.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our principal uses of cash for investing activities were primarily $159.2 million in additions to property and equipment.  

Cash Flows (used in)/provided by Financing Activities  

Our net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities was $(1.7) million and $2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Our cash flows used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily comprised of $1.0 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations and a $0.7 million payment of debt issuance costs. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our cash flows provided by financing activities were   primarily comprised of a $7.9 million excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation offset by $4.1 million in principal payments on long-term debt and $1.2 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging, or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the condensed consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 10 -   Commitments and Contingencies   to the condensed consolidated financial statements, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   of our Annual Report or (iii) discussed under  Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       below.  

ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND   QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates from time to time and market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our cash flows and earnings. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding $1,430.0 million 2023 Unsecured Notes and $900.0 million 2025 Unsecured Notes (collectively, the  Notes ), a balance of $1,837.4 million on our Term Loan Facility, and $51.9 million of capital lease obligations. As of September 30, 2016, we had $442.1 million available for borrowing under our Revolver, subject to certain conditions. 

46 

Table of Contents  

Based on current market interest rates for debt of similar terms and average maturities and based on recent transactions, we estimate the fair value of our Notes to be $2,460.0 million as of September 30, 2016. Our 2023 Unsecured Notes and 2025 Unsecured Notes accrue interest at fixed rates of 6.00% and 6.375%, respectively. 

Both our Revolver and our Term Loan Facility accrue interest at floating rates subject to certain conditions. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rates (including margin) on the Term Loan Facility and our Revolver were approximately 3.75% and 3.6%, respectively. A hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rate on our Term Loan Facility of one percentage point would increase our annual interest expense by 0.8% or $15.5 million, which is limited as a result of the applicable interest rate as of September 30, 2016 being below the Credit Agreement s 1.0% LIBOR floor. A hypothetical increase of one percentage point above the LIBOR floor would increase the Company s annual interest expense by approximately $18.4 million before considering the offsetting effects of our interest rate swaps. 

In August 2012, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $750.0 million and a maturity date of June 30, 2017. The contracts state that we pay a 1.67% fixed rate of interest for the term of the agreements, beginning June 30, 2013. The counterparties pay to us the greater of actual LIBOR or 1.25%. We entered into the swap arrangements to reduce the risk of increased interest costs associated with potential future increases in LIBOR rates. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR rates of 100 basis points would increase the fair value of our interest rate swaps by approximately $3.9 million. 

We are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates if it is necessary to seek additional funding to support the expansion of our business and to support acquisitions. The interest rate that we may be able to obtain on future debt financings will be dependent on market conditions. 

We have exposure to market risk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our foreign activities accounted for 31% of our consolidated revenue. We monitor foreign markets and our commitments in such markets to assess currency and other risks. A 1% increase in foreign exchange rates would change consolidated revenue by approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangement designed to limit exposure to foreign currencies. As a result of our European expansion related to our acquisitions of Geo Networks Limited and Neo Telecoms as well as our recently closed acquisitions of Viatel and Allstream our level of foreign activities is expected to increase and if it does, we may determine that such hedging arrangements would be appropriate and will consider such arrangements to minimize our exposure to foreign exchange risk.  

We do not have any material commodity price risk. 

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS   AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Management has established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and our subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

47 

Table of Contents  

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of not completing the remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified and described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

As previously disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2016, the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting determined that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016 because of the material weaknesses described below.  The material weaknesses were caused by the Company not having a sufficient number of employees that were adequately trained with respect to COSO 2013 Framework, and the Company not conducting timely monitoring activities to determine the effective operation of control activities within the information technology organization and revenue recognition with respect to collectability criterion.   

The control deficiencies resulted in no misstatements in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  These control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded in Item 9A of our Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2016 that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016. 

Management s Remediation Plan 

Management is committed to remediating the control deficiencies and has been actively engaged in developing remediation plans to address the above control deficiencies.  Management is responsible for implementing changes and improvements in our internal control over financial reporting and for remediating the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company has taken the following actions to address the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting: 

redesigned user and developer access controls to restrict IT and financial users  access privileges to IT applications commensurate with their assigned responsibilities.     

developed a monitoring process designed to actively monitor program changes and user access activities to ensure that program changes and user access were appropriate and that any deficiencies were investigated and remediated.     

designed an enhanced set of internal controls around revenue recognition collectability criterion. Specifically, management documented expectations, criteria for investigation, and the level of precision used in the performance of the review control, and how outliers were addressed.     

Management started conducting additional training regarding evidence standards for documenting operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.      

Management has started to perform certain of the additional controls described above during the quarter; however, because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation of these material weaknesses will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective and there is no assurance that additional remediation steps will not be necessary.  Our remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting is ongoing, however, we expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed by June 30, 2017. 

Further, we are also in process of hiring additional personnel to assist with remediation efforts and internal control execution, as well as providing additional training for existing personnel.

Other than the actions taken as described above under  Management s Remediation Plan  there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We continue to implement the remediation plan outlined above to remediate the material weaknesses identified as part of our annual controls assessment.

ITEM 1.   LEGAL   PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time party to various litigation matters that we believe are incidental to the operation of our business. We record an appropriate provision when the occurrence of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We cannot estimate with certainty our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to any such pending litigation matters and it is possible one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on us. However, we believe that the outcome of such pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, our consolidated financial condition or our liquidity.

			 Shares Subject to the Plan and to Awards

			 Aggregate Limits  .  The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan shall be equal to fourteen (14) million.  Commencing with the first business day of each fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the Company s fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the Effective Date occurs, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be increased by a number equal to the lesser of (A) a number of shares of Common Stock that when added to the total number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to new Awards under the Plan (excluding from this calculation shares then subject to outstanding Awards) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Company would result in a total of number of shares available for issuance pursuant to new Awards under the Plan equal to six percent (6%) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Company, calculated on a fully diluted basis or (B) such lesser number of shares as determined by the Board.

			 Issuance of Shares  .

The aggregate number of shares available for issuance under this Plan at any time shall not be reduced by (i) shares subject to Awards that have been terminated, expired unexercised, forfeited or settled in cash, (ii) shares subject to Awards that have been retained or withheld by the Company in payment or satisfaction of the exercise price, purchase price or tax withholding obligation of an Award, or (iii) shares subject to      

5 

Exhibit 10.2 

Awards that otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares in connection with payment or settlement thereof.  In addition, shares that have been delivered (either actually or by attestation) to the Company in payment or satisfaction of the exercise price, purchase price or tax withholding obligation of an Award shall be available for issuance under this Plan.     

(c) 
			 Tax Code Limits  .  The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan shall be equal to fourteen (14) million, which number shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 14 only to the extent that such adjustment will not affect the status of any option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code.     

(d) 
			 Substitute Awards  .  Substitute Awards shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan or authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year.  Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary, or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines, has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan; provided that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were employees of such acquired or combined company before such acquisition or combination.     

6. 
			 Administration of the Plan     

(a) 
			 Administrator of the Plan  .  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Board shall fill vacancies on, and from time to time may remove or add members to, the Committee.  The Committee shall act pursuant to a majority vote or unanimous written consent.  Any power of the Committee may also be exercised by the Board, except to the extent that the grant or exercise of such authority would cause any Award or transaction to become subject to (or lose an exemption under) the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or cause an Award intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code not to qualify for such treatment.  To the extent that any permitted action taken by the Board conflicts with action taken by the Committee, the Board action shall control.  To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the Committee (or any successor) may by resolution delegate any or all of its authority to one or more subcommittees composed of one or more directors and/or officers, and any such subcommittee shall be treated as the Committee for all purposes under this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board or the Committee (or any successor) delegates to a subcommittee comprised of one or more officers of the Company (who are not also directors) the authority to grant Awards, the resolution so authorizing such subcommittee shall specify the total number of shares of Common Stock such subcommittee may award pursuant to such delegated authority, and no such subcommittee shall designate any officer serving thereon or any executive officer or non-employee director of the Company as a recipient of any Awards granted under      

6 

Exhibit 10.2 

such delegated authority.  The Committee hereby delegates to and designates the senior human resources officer of the Company (or such other officer with similar authority), and to his or her delegates or designees, the authority to assist the Committee in the day-to-day administration of the Plan and of Awards granted under the Plan, including without limitation the power to execute agreements evidencing Awards made under this Plan or other documents entered into under this Plan on behalf of the Committee or the Company.  The Committee may further designate and delegate to one or more additional officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary, and/or one or more agents, authority to assist the Committee in any or all aspects of the day-to-day administration of the Plan and/or of Awards granted under the Plan.     

(b) 
			 Powers of Committee  .  Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall be authorized and empowered to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the administration of this Plan, including, without limitation:     

(1) 
			 to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to this Plan and to define terms not otherwise defined herein;     

(2) 
			 to determine which persons are Eligible Persons, to which of such Eligible Persons, if any, Awards shall be granted hereunder and the timing of any such Awards;     

(3) 
			 to prescribe and amend the terms of the Award Agreements, to grant Awards and determine the terms and conditions thereof;     

(4) 
			 to establish and verify the extent of satisfaction of any performance goals or other conditions applicable to the grant, issuance, retention, vesting, exercisability or settlement of any Award;     

(5) 
			 to prescribe and amend the terms of or form of any document or notice required to be delivered to the Company by Participants under this Plan;     

(6) 
			 to determine the extent to which adjustments are required pursuant to Section 14;     

(7) 
			 to interpret and construe this Plan, any rules and regulations under this Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted hereunder, and to make exceptions to any such provisions if the Committee, in good faith, determines that it is appropriate to do so;     

(8) 
			 to approve corrections in the documentation or administration of any Award; and     

(9) 
			 to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan.     

The Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without amendment to the Plan, but subject to the limitations otherwise set forth in Section 18, waive or amend the operation of Plan provisions respecting exercise after Termination of Employment with the Company or an Affiliate.  The Committee or any member thereof may, in its sole and absolute discretion and, except as otherwise provided in Section 18, waive, settle or adjust any of the terms of any Award   

7 

Exhibit 10.2 

so as to avoid unanticipated consequences or address unanticipated events (including any temporary closure of an applicable stock exchange, disruption of communications or natural catastrophe). 

(c) 
			 Determinations by the Committee  .  All decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Committee regarding the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of or operation of any Award granted hereunder, shall be final and binding on all Participants, beneficiaries, heirs, assigns or other persons holding or claiming rights under the Plan or any Award.  The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems relevant, in its sole and absolute discretion, to making such decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or other employee of the Company and such attorneys, consultants and accountants as it may select.  Members of the Board and members of the Committee acting under the Plan shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the advice of counsel and shall incur no liability except for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of their duties.     

(d) 
			 Subsidiary Awards  .  In the case of a grant of an Award to any Participant employed by a Subsidiary, such grant may, if the Committee so directs, be implemented by the Company issuing any subject shares of Common Stock to the Subsidiary, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may determine, upon the condition or understanding that the Subsidiary will transfer the shares of Common Stock to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, such Award may be issued by and in the name of the Subsidiary and shall be deemed granted on such date as the Committee shall determine.     

(a) 
			 Terms Set Forth in Award Agreement  .  Awards may be granted at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the Plan to Eligible Persons as determined by the Committee.  The terms and conditions of each Award shall be set forth in an Award Agreement in a form approved by the Committee for such Award, which Award Agreement may contain such terms and conditions as specified from time to time by the Committee, provided such terms and conditions do not conflict with the Plan.  The Award Agreement for any Award (other than Restricted Stock awards) shall include the time or times at or within which and the consideration, if any, for which any shares of Common Stock may be acquired from the Company.  The terms of Awards may vary among Participants, and the Plan does not impose upon the Committee any requirement to make Awards subject to uniform terms.  Accordingly, the terms of individual Award Agreements may vary.     

(b) 
			 Rights of a Stockholder  .  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by an Award (including voting rights) until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of such shares of Common Stock.  No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such date, except as provided in Section 10(b) or Section 14 of this Plan or as otherwise provided by the Committee.

Exhibit 10.2 

(a) 
			 Grant, Term and Price  .  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of any Option shall occur at such time and be subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee or under criteria established by the Committee, which may include conditions based on continued employment or service, passage of time, attainment of age and/or service requirements, and/or satisfaction of performance conditions.  The term of an Option shall in no event be greater than ten (10) years; provided, however, the term of an Option (other than an Incentive Stock Option) shall be automatically extended if, at the time of its scheduled expiration, the Participant holding such Option is prohibited by law or the Company s insider trading policy from exercising the Option, which extension shall expire on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date such prohibition no longer applies.  The Committee will establish the price at which Common Stock may be purchased upon exercise of an Option, which, in no event will be less than the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date of grant; provided, however, that the exercise price per share of Common Stock with respect to an Option that is granted as a Substitute Award may be less than the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the date such Option is granted if such exercise price is based on a formula set forth in the terms of the options held by such optionees or in the terms of the agreement providing for such merger or other acquisition that satisfies the requirements of (i) Section 409A of the Code, if such options held by such optionees are not intended to qualify as  incentive stock options  within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and (ii) Section 424(a) of the Code, if such options held by such optionees are intended to qualify as  incentive stock options  within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.  The exercise price of any Option may be paid in cash or such other method as determined by the Committee, including an irrevocable commitment by a broker to pay over such amount from a sale of the Shares issuable under an Option, the delivery of previously owned shares of Common Stock or withholding of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise.     

(b) 
			 No Repricing without Stockholder Approval  .  Other than in connection with a change in the Company s capitalization (as described in Section 14), the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, reduce the exercise price of a previously awarded Option and, at any time when the exercise price of a previously awarded Option is above the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock, the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, cancel and re-grant or exchange such Option for cash or a new Award with a lower (or no) exercise price.     

(c) 
			 No Reload Grants  .  Options shall not be granted under the Plan in consideration for and shall not be conditioned upon the delivery of shares of Common Stock to the Company in payment of the exercise price and/or tax withholding obligation under any other employee stock option.     

(d) 
			 Incentive Stock Options  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, in the case of the grant of an Option intending to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, if the Participant owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company (a  10% Stockholder ), the exercise price of such Option must be at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of grant and the Option must expire within a period of not more than five (5) years from the date of grant.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8 to the contrary, options designated as      

9 

Exhibit 10.2 

Incentive Stock Options shall not be eligible for treatment under the Code as Incentive Stock Options (and will be deemed to be Nonqualified Stock Options) to the extent that either (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted, or (b) such Options otherwise remain exercisable but are not exercised within three (3) months (or such other period of time provided in Section 422 of the Code) of separation of service (as determined in accordance with Section 3401(c) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder).     

(e) 
			 No Stockholder Rights  .  Participants shall have no voting rights and will have no rights to receive dividends or Dividend Equivalents in respect of an Option or any shares of Common Stock subject to an Option until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares.     

9. 
			 Stock Appreciation Rights     

(a) 
			 General Terms  .  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of any Stock Appreciation Right shall occur at such time and be subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee or under criteria established by the Committee, which may include conditions based on continued employment or service, passage of time, attainment of age and/or service requirements, and/or satisfaction of performance conditions.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants from time to time either in tandem with or as a component of Options granted under the Plan ( tandem SARs ) or not in conjunction with other Awards ( freestanding SARs ).  Upon exercise of a tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares covered by the grant, the related Option shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of shares covered by such exercise.  Conversely, if the related Option is exercised as to some or all of the shares covered by the grant, the related tandem SAR, if any, shall be canceled automatically to the extent of the number of shares covered by the Option exercise.  Any Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with an Option may be granted at the same time such Option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Option, provided that the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the date of the SAR s grant is not greater than the exercise price of the related Option.  All freestanding SARs shall be granted subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to Options as set forth in Section 8 and all tandem SARs shall have the same exercise price as the Option to which they relate.  Subject to the provisions of Section 8 and the immediately preceding sentence, the Committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any Stock Appreciation Right as it shall deem appropriate.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be settled in Common Stock, cash, Restricted Stock or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.     

(b) 
			 No Repricing without Stockholder Approval  .  Other than in connection with a change in the Company s capitalization (as described in Section 14), the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, reduce the exercise price of a previously awarded Stock Appreciation Right and, at any time when the exercise price of a previously awarded Stock Appreciation Right is above the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock, the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, cancel and re-grant or exchange such Stock Appreciation Right for cash or a new Award with a lower (or no) exercise price.     

10 

Exhibit 10.2 

(c) 
			 No Stockholder Rights  .  Participants shall have no voting rights and will have no rights to receive dividends or Dividend Equivalents in respect of an Award of Stock Appreciation Rights or any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award of Stock Appreciation Rights until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares.     

10. 
			 Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units     

(a) 
			 Vesting and Performance Criteria  .  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall occur at such time and be subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee or under criteria established by the Committee, which may include conditions based on continued employment or service, passage of time, attainment of age and/or service requirements, and /or satisfaction of performance conditions.  In addition, the Committee shall have the right to grant Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Awards as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under other stockholder-approved compensation plans or arrangements of the Company.     

(b) 
			 Dividends and Distributions  .  Participants in whose name Restricted Stock is granted shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those shares of Common Stock, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.  The Committee will determine whether any such dividends or distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of Restricted Stock and/or subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the Restricted Stock with respect to which they were distributed or whether such dividends or distributions will be paid in cash.  Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to dividends or distributions only to the extent provided by the Committee.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will dividends or Dividend Equivalents be paid during the performance period with respect to unearned Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are subject to performance-based vesting criteria.  Dividends or Dividend Equivalents accrued on such shares shall become payable no earlier than the date the performance-based vesting criteria have been achieved and the underlying shares or Restricted Stock Units have been earned.     

(a) 
			 Payment Criteria  .  The Committee shall establish the performance criteria and level of achievement versus these criteria, or such other criteria (which need not be performance-based), that shall determine the amount payable under an Incentive Bonus, which may include a target, threshold and/or maximum amount payable and any formula for determining such achievement, and which criteria may be based on performance conditions.     

(b) 
			 Timing and Form of Payment  .  The Committee shall determine the timing of payment of any Incentive Bonus.  Payment of the amount due under an Incentive Bonus may be made in cash, Common Stock, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or other Awards, as determined by the Committee.     

(c) 
			 Discretionary Adjustments  .  Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals and, the amount paid under an Incentive Bonus on account of either financial performance      

11 

Exhibit 10.2 

or personal performance evaluations may be adjusted by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee shall determine.     

12. 
			 Deferral of Payment.    The Committee may, in an Award Agreement or otherwise, provide for the deferred delivery of Common Stock or cash upon settlement, vesting or other events with respect to Restricted Stock Units, or in payment or satisfaction of an Incentive Bonus.  No Award shall provide for deferral of compensation that is not intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code; provided, however, that the Company, the Board and the Committee shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Board or the Committee.     

13. 
			 Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Awards.    The Committee may provide that the Common Stock subject to or issued under an Award shall be subject to such further agreements, restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Committee in its discretion may specify prior to the grant, vesting, exercise or settlement of such Award, including without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the Common Stock issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award (including the actual or constructive surrender of Common Stock already owned by the Participant) or payment of taxes arising in connection with an Award.  Without limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued under an Award, including without limitation (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by the Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers, (iv) provisions requiring Common Stock be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations and (v) mandatory holding periods.     

14. 
			 Adjustment of and Changes in the Stock     

(a) 
			 The number and kind of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan (including under any Awards then outstanding), and the number and kind of shares of Common Stock subject to the limits set forth in Section 5 of this Plan, shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee to reflect any reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, dividend or distribution of securities, property or cash (other than regular, quarterly cash dividends), or any other event or transaction that affects the number or kind of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Such adjustment may be designed to comply with Section 424 of the Code or may be designed to treat the shares of Common Stock available under the Plan and subject to Awards as if they were all outstanding on the record date for such event or transaction or to increase the number of such shares of Common Stock to reflect a deemed reinvestment in shares of Common Stock of the amount distributed to the Company s securityholders.  The terms of any outstanding Award shall also be equitably adjusted by the Committee as to price, number or kind of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award, vesting, and other terms to reflect the foregoing events, which adjustments need not be uniform as between different Awards or different types of Awards.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to such an adjustment.     

12 

Exhibit 10.2 

(b) 
			 In the event there shall be any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of Common Stock, or any stock or other securities into which such Common Stock shall have been changed, or for which it shall have been exchanged, by reason of a Change in Control, other merger, consolidation or otherwise, then the Committee shall determine the appropriate and equitable adjustment to be effected, which adjustments need not be uniform between different Awards or different types of Awards.  In addition, in the event of such change described in this paragraph, the Committee may accelerate the time or times at which any Award may be exercised, consistent with and as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code, and may provide for cancellation of such accelerated Awards that are not exercised within a time prescribed by the Committee in its sole discretion.     

(c) 
			 In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, and except as otherwise expressly provided in the Award Agreement or another contract, including an employment agreement, or under the terms of a transaction constituting a Change in Control, the Committee shall provide for the treatment of outstanding Awards pursuant to any one of the following methods as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion:     

(1) 
			 the cancelation and cash settlement of all outstanding Awards; or     

(2) 
			 the conditions to the exercisability, grant, issuance, retention, vesting or transferability of, or any restrictions applicable to, all outstanding Awards shall lapse in full; provided, however, that in the case of any Award the vesting of which is in whole or in part subject to performance criteria or an Incentive Bonus, all conditions to the grant, issuance, retention, vesting or transferability of, or any other restrictions applicable to, such Award shall immediately lapse and the Participant shall have the right to receive a payment based on the greater of (i) performance through a date determined by the Committee, or (ii) target performance, if applicable; or      

(3) 
			 the assumption or continuation of all outstanding Awards or the substitution or conversion of all outstanding Awards with substantially equivalent economic value by the successor company; provided, however, that any such assumed, continued, substituted or converted Award shall provide for the lapse of conditions to exercisability, grant, issuance, retention, vesting or transferability of, or any restrictions applicable to, all assumed, continued, substituted or converted Awards in the event of a Participant s Termination of Employment without Cause within eighteen (18) months following a Change in Control; or     

(4) 
			 a combination of any of the above.       

(d) 
			 The Company shall notify Participants holding Awards subject to any adjustments pursuant to this Section 14 of such adjustment, but (whether or not notice is given) such adjustment shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.     

(e) 
			 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 14 to the contrary, an adjustment to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right under this Section 14 shall be made in a manner that will not result in the grant of a new Option or Stock Appreciation Right under Section 409A of the Code.  In addition, in no event shall any action be taken pursuant to this Section 14 that would change      

13 

Exhibit 10.2 

the payment or settlement date of an Award in a manner that would result in the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.     

15. 
			 Transferability.    Each Award may not be sold, transferred for value, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and each Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only by the Participant during his or her lifetime.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, outstanding Options may be exercised following the Participant s death by the Participant s beneficiaries or as permitted by the Committee.     

16. 
			 Compliance with Laws and Regulations.    This Plan, the grant, issuance, vesting, exercise and settlement of Awards thereunder, and the obligation of the Company to sell, issue or deliver shares of Common Stock under such Awards, shall be subject to all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, stock exchange rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required.  The Company shall not be required to register in a Participant s name or deliver Common Stock prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any foreign, federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable.  To the extent the Company is unable to or the Committee deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Common Stock hereunder, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such shares of Common Stock as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  No Option shall be exercisable and no Common Stock shall be issued and/or transferable under any other Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Common Stock underlying such Option is effective and current or the Company has determined that such registration is unnecessary.     

In the event an Award is granted to or held by a Participant who is employed or providing services outside the United States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, modify the provisions of the Plan or of such Award as they pertain to such individual to comply with applicable foreign law or to recognize differences in local law, currency or tax policy.  The Committee may also impose conditions on the grant, issuance, exercise, vesting, settlement or retention of Awards in order to comply with such foreign law and/or to minimize the Company s obligations with respect to tax equalization for Participants employed outside their home country. 

17. 
			 Withholding.    To the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, the Committee may and/or a Participant shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any withholding tax obligations that arise with respect to any Award, or the issuance or sale of any shares of Common Stock.  The Company shall not be required to recognize any Participant rights under an Award, to issue shares of Common Stock or to recognize the disposition of such shares of Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied.  To the extent permitted or required by the Committee, these obligations may or shall be satisfied by the Company withholding cash from any compensation otherwise payable to or for the benefit of a Participant, the Company withholding a portion of the shares of Common Stock that otherwise would be issued to a Participant under such Award or any other award held by the      

14 

Exhibit 10.2 

Participant or by the Participant tendering to the Company cash or, if allowed by the Committee, shares of Common Stock.     

18. 
			 Amendment of the Plan or Awards.    The Board may amend, alter or discontinue this Plan and the Committee may amend, or alter any agreement or other document evidencing an Award made under this Plan but, except as provided pursuant to the provisions of Section 14, no such amendment shall, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company:     

(a) 
			 increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which Awards may be granted under this Plan;     

(b) 
			 reduce the price at which Options may be granted below the price provided for in Section 8(a);     

(c) 
			 reprice outstanding Options or SARs as described in 8(b) and 9(b);     

(d) 
			 extend the term of this Plan;     

(e) 
			 change the class of persons eligible to be Participants;     

(f) 
			 increase the individual maximum limits in Section 5(c); or     

(g) 
			 otherwise amend the Plan in any manner requiring stockholder approval by law or the rules of any stock exchange or market or quotation system on which the Common Stock is traded, listed or quoted.     

No amendment or alteration to the Plan or an Award or Award Agreement shall be made which would impair the rights of the holder of an Award, without such holder s consent, provided that no such consent shall be required if the Committee determines in its sole discretion and prior to the date of any change in control that such amendment or alteration either (i) is required or advisable in order for the Company, the Plan or the Award to satisfy any law or regulation or to meet the requirements of or avoid adverse financial accounting consequences under any accounting standard, or (ii) is not reasonably likely to significantly diminish the benefits provided under such Award, or that any such diminishment has been adequately compensated. 

19. 
			 No Liability of Company.    The Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate which is in existence or hereafter comes into existence, the Board and the Committee shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (a) the non-issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Common Stock hereunder; and (b) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.     

20. 
			 Non-Exclusivity of Plan.    Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or the Committee to adopt such other incentive arrangements as either may deem desirable.     

15 

Exhibit 10.2 

21. 
			 Governing Law.    This Plan and any agreements or other documents hereunder shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable federal law.  Any reference in this Plan or in the agreement or other document evidencing any Awards to a provision of law or to a rule or regulation shall be deemed to include any successor law, rule or regulation of similar effect or applicability.     

22. 
			 No Right to Employment, Reelection or Continued Service.    Nothing in this Plan or an Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates to terminate any Participant s employment, service on the Board or service for the Company at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law, nor shall this Plan or an Award itself confer upon any Participant any right to continue his or her employment or service for any specified period of time.  Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under this Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company, any Subsidiary and/or its Affiliates.  Subject to Sections 4 and 18, this Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Board without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates.     

23. 
			 Section 409A Compliance  . The Board intends that, except as may be otherwise determined by the Committee, any Awards under the Plan satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related regulations and Treasury pronouncements to avoid the imposition of any taxes, including additional income taxes, thereunder. If the Committee determines that an Award, Award Agreement, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Participant to become subject to Section 409A of the Code, unless the Committee expressly determines otherwise, such grant of Award, payment, distribution, deferral election, transaction or other action or arrangement shall not be undertaken and the related provisions of the Plan and/or Award Agreement will be amended or deemed modified in as close a manner as possible to give effect to the original terms of the Award, or, only if necessary because a modification or deemed modification would not be reasonably effective in avoiding the additional income tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code, rescinded in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A  of the Code to the extent determined by the Committee without the consent of or notice to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Award intended by the Committee to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A  of the Code which is to be paid out when vested, such payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Award becomes vested, but in no event shall such payment be made later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Award became vested unless otherwise permitted under the exemption provisions of Section 409A of the Code.     

24. 
			 Specified Employee Delay.    To the extent any payment or benefit under this Plan is considered deferred compensation subject to (and not exempt from) the restrictions contained in Section 409A of the Code, such payment may not be made to a specified employee (as determined in accordance with a uniform policy adopted by the Company with respect to all arrangements subject to Section 409A of the Code) upon Separation from Service before the date that is six months after the specified employee s Separation form Service (or, if earlier, the specified employee s death).  Any payment that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be accumulated and paid on the sixth month plus one day following the specified      

16 

Exhibit 10.2 

employee s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as soon as administratively practicable after the specified employee s death).     

25. 
			 No Liability of Committee Members.    No member of the Committee shall be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by such member or on his behalf in his capacity as a member of the Committee nor for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each other employee, officer or director of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan may be allocated or delegated, against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person s own fraud or willful bad faith; provided, however, that approval of the Board shall be required for the payment of any amount in settlement of a claim against any such person.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company s Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.     

26. 
			 Severability.    If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.     

Unfunded Plan.    The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.  Participants are and shall at all times be general creditors of the Company with respect to their Awards.  If the Committee or the Company chooses to set aside funds in a trust or otherwise for the payment of Awards under the Plan, such funds shall at all times be subject to the claims of the creditors of the Company in the event of its bankruptcy or insolvency.

ZAYO GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.  

2014 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  

PEFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 

SUMMARY 

PART A1 AWARD 

The Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors of Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) has adopted a Performance Compensation Incentive Program (the  PCIP ) that will provide for the quarterly grant equity awards in the form of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) based upon Company and individual performance.   

You have been selected to participate in Part A1 of the PCIP, which is directed toward general employee population.  The following is a summary of the terms and conditions of your participation in Part A1 of the PCIP.   

Please note that your participation in the PCIP and the grant of awards to you under the PCIP does not constitute an employment contract, express or implied, nor impose upon the Company any obligation to employ or continue to employ you.  Nothing herein shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate your employment at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law.  In addition, please note that the Company may amend, suspend or discontinue the PCIP and/or your participation in any part of the PCIP at any time; provided that such amendment, suspension or termination will not affect your rights with respect to any outstanding awards previously granted to you under the PCIP without your consent. 

Quarterly Grants 

During your participation in Part A1 of the PCIP, you will eligible to receive awards on a quarterly basis, subject to being employed and in good standing on the first day of the Measurement Period (as defined below) and remain so through the RSU grant date for such Measurement Period.  

Awards under Part A1 of the PCIP are determined based upon the Company s Equity IRR (as defined below) performance over a two quarter period in which the second quarter precedes the quarter of the grant date ( Measurement Period ).        

Structure of Part A1 Awards 

Awards earned under Part A1 of the PCIP will be payable in the form of RSUs; provided, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay earned Part A1 awards in cash rather than RSUs.  RSUs awarded pursuant to Part A1 of the PCIP represent the right to receive, upon vesting, shares of the Company s common stock.  All RSUs awarded under the PCIP will be granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the  Plan ) and a form of Restricted Stock Unit award agreement adopted under the Plan to evidence the grant of RSUs awarded under Part A of the PCIP and included as Exhibit A hereto. 

Exhibit 10.3 

As set forth in more detail in the Restricted Stock Unit award agreement, RSUs granted in respect of Part A1 of the PCIP will vest,   provided the employee remains actively employed by the Company  , in full on the last day of the fourth fiscal quarter ending after the grant date of the RSU. For example, an RSU awarded in respect of Part A1 of the PCIP in February 2015 for the Measurement Period through actual results of the second fiscal quarter of FY 2015, will 100% cliff vest and convert to shares of the Company s common stock,   provided the Employee remains actively employed by the Company   on March 31, 2016. 

Measurement of Part A1 Awards 

For each fiscal quarter, you will have the opportunity to earn an award with an aggregate value equal to up to 200% of the quarterly amount of your annual Target Award.  The amount actually earned will be based upon (i) the aggregate Company Part A1 RSU pool funding as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and (ii) your individual payout as determined by Management in its sole discretion.  

The Committee will evaluate the Company and the Part A1 RSU pool funding (from which any individual participant s grant would be funded) based upon the Company s Equity IRR (as defined below) for the applicable Measurement Period.  While the Committee s determination of the Company s aggregate payout will be guided by the table below, they will take other factors into consideration and ultimately retains sole discretion in its determination.   

Note that 25% is simply the floor at which the Part A1 RSU pool may be allocated.  No individual participant in Part A1 of the PCIP has any guaranteed right to a minimum or any payment thereunder. 

Your individual participant payout may range from 0% to 200% of your Target Award for the quarter, as determined by Management at its sole discretion. Factors may include Company, group and individual performance and results.  

For purposes of the PCIP,  Equity IRR  for any Measurement Period means:  the percentage increase in the Company s Equity Value as measured over the Measurement Period.  For purposes of the PCIP,  Equity Value  means the Company s estimated enterprise value plus cash balance minus debt outstanding ( Net Debt ), with Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt determined based upon the Company s publicly-reported financial statements for any fiscal quarter.  

Exhibit 10.3 

Form of Payment of Part A1 Awards 

As described above, your Earned Award (as determined by either the Committee in its sole discretion or management pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Committee) pursuant to Part A1 of the PCIP for any fiscal quarter will generally be paid form of RSUs (to be granted promptly following the determination of the Earned Award).  The number of RSUs awarded for any fiscal quarter will equal your Earned Award and divided by the average closing price of the Company s common stock over the last ten (10) trading days of the fiscal quarter ending immediately prior to the grant date.

Exhibit 10.4 

ZAYO GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.  

2014 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  

SUMMARY 

PART B RSU PLAN 

The Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board of Directors of Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) has adopted a Performance Compensation Incentive Program (the  PCIP ) that will provide for the quarterly grant equity awards in the form of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) based upon Company and individual performance.   

You have been selected to participate in Part B of the PCIP, which is directed toward members of the Company s senior management group.  The following is a summary of the terms and conditions of your participation in Part B of the PCIP.   

Please note that your participation in the PCIP and the grant of awards to you under the PCIP does not constitute an employment contract, express or implied, nor impose upon the Company any obligation to employ or continue to employ you.  Nothing herein shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate your employment at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law.  In addition, please note that the Company may amend, suspend or discontinue the PCIP and/or your participation in any part of the PCIP at any time; provided that such amendment, suspension or termination will not affect your rights with respect to any outstanding awards previously granted to you under the PCIP without your consent. 

Quarterly Grants 

During your participation in Part B of the PCIP, you will eligible to receive awards on a quarterly basis, subject to being employed and in good standing on the first day of the Measurement Period (as defined below) and remain so through the RSU grant date for such Measurement Period. 

The aggregate target and maximum value of awards available on a quarterly basis to Part B participants under the under Part B of the PCIP shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Part B participants   and each participant s percentage participation in the quarterly target value   shall also be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion based upon any factors it deems relevant.  Awards under Part B of the PCIP will then be communicated to participants.  The first awards under Part B of the PCIP are anticipated to be granted immediately following the consummation of the Company s initial public offering.  Note that an employee s participation and percentage participation in any quarterly award is not a guarantee of future quarterly awards. 

Structure of Part B Awards 

Awards under Part B of the PCIP will be payable solely in the form of RSUs.  RSUs awarded pursuant to Part B of the PCIP will be granted pursuant to the Stock Plan and a form of Restricted Stock Unit award agreement adopted under the Stock Plan to evidence the grant of RSUs awarded under Part B of the PCIP and included as Exhibit B hereto. 

Exhibit 10.4 

As set forth in more detail in the Restricted Stock Unit award agreement, RSUs granted in respect of Part B of the PCIP will vest (if at all), subject to continued employment with the Company and Company stock price performance, on the last day of the fourth full fiscal quarter ending after the grant date of the RSU (such four fiscal quarter period the  Performance Period ).  For example, an RSU awarded in respect of Part B of the PCIP near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY 2015, will 100% cliff vest (if at all), subject to continued employment and Company stock price performance, on the last day of the third quarter of FY 2016 (March 31, 2016). 

Measurement of Part B Awards 

The number of RSUs earned under Part B awards, if any, will be determined following the end of the Performance Period to which such RSUs relate and based on the Company s stock price performance over the Performance Period.  The following table set forth the payout percentage, expressed as a percentage of the number of RSUs awarded to you, which may be earned by you under Part B of the PCIP based upon the Company s stock price performance over the Performance Period (calculated in the manner set forth below): 

Stock Price Performance Range  

Payout % of Target at Top of Range  

Average % Increase In Payout Within Range  

% to    %  

%  

%  

% to    %

%  

% to    %  

%  

%  

% to    %  

%  

%  

Examples: The payout percentage increases on average by     % for every     % increase in stock price performance above   % and up to   %.  The payout percentage increases on average by   % for every 1% increase in stock price performance above   % and up to   %.  There is no payout under the Award if stock price performance is below   %.   

In addition, should the Company s stock price performance over the Performance Period exceed    %, then the payout percentage shall be    % multiplied by the Beginning Price multiplied by    , then divided by the Ending Price.  

Note that the above payout percentages reflect (and are therefore net of) the benefit of the Company s stock appreciation over the Performance Period.  

For purposes of the Part B RSUs and the table above,  stock price performance  will be calculated as the percentage increase in the Company s stock price from the beginning to the end of the Performance Period, adjusted for dividends paid during the Performance Period (assuming such dividends are reinvested in the Common Stock on the dividend payment date).  For purposes of this calculation, the Company s stock price at the beginning of the Performance Period shall be the average closing price of the Company s common stock over the ten (10)     trading     day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the first day of the   

Exhibit 10.4 

Performance Period (the  Beginning Price ), and the Company s stock price at the end of the Performance Period shall be the average closing price of the Common Stock over the ten (10)     trading     day period ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period (the  Ending Price ). 

The actual number of Part B RSUs awarded to you in any quarter will be determined by first looking at the Company s stock price at the beginning of the applicable Performance Period and projecting what the Company s stock price would need to be at the end of the Performance Period in order for the Company to have achieved stock price performance of    % (assuming reinvestment of any dividend payments scheduled (as of the date of grant) to be made during the Performance Period).  Your number of awarded Part B RSUs would then equal the target dollar value allocated for your Part B RSU award for the applicable quarter divided by this ending stock price.

Exhibit 10.5 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 

This Employment Agreement (the    Agreement   ) is entered into as of   July 27, 2016   (the    Effective Date   ) between Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the    Company   ) and John F. Waters, Jr. (the    Executive   ) (each of the foregoing individually a    Party    and collectively the    Parties   ).  

WHEREAS, the Company wishes to employ the Executive and the Executive wishes to be employed by the Company, in each case, on the terms and conditions set forth herein; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 

1. 
			 Term  .  The term of the Executive s employment hereunder shall commence on August 15, 2016 and shall continue until terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof (the period between August 15, 2016 and the termination date referred to herein as the    Term   ).  During the Term, the Executive will devote substantially all of his business time and use his best efforts to advance the business and welfare of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates  .    The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from serving on civic or charitable boards or committees or managing personal investments,  so long as any such activities do not interfere with the performance of the Executive s responsibilities hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement is not a contract or a guarantee of employment for any specific period of time.  The Executive s employment with the Company is  at-will.      

2. 
			 Position  .  During the Term, the Executive shall serve as Chief Technology Officer and President of Network Solutions of the Company, and shall report directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company,     with direct accountability to the Chief Operating Officer for certain functions.  During the Term, the Executive shall also serve in such other capacities as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (the    Board   ) consistent with the Executive s position and shall render such other services for the Company as the Board may from time to time reasonably request and as shall be consistent with the Executive s position and responsibilities.       

3. 
			 Cash Compensation and Employee Benefits  .       

(a) 
			 Cash Compensation  .  During the Term, the Executive shall receive a base salary at a rate of $325,000 per annum, which shall be paid in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Company (the    Base Salary   ).       

(b) 
			 Incentive Cash Compensation  .  Beginning on October 1, 2016 and thereafter during the Term, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Company s discretionary Incentive Cash Compensation Program (the    ICC   ).  The Executive s target annual bonus under the ICC shall be $200,000 (with a target bonus of $50,000 per quarter), which shall be prorated to account for any partial year.   Actual payments under, and the terms and conditions of, the ICC shall be determined by the Board or the compensation committee thereof (the  Compensation Committee ) in its sole discretion.  Any bonus awarded pursuant to this Section      

3(b) shall be paid pursuant to the terms of the ICC or any successor bonus program; provided, however, that any such bonus payment will be paid no later than March 15 of the year following the calendar year in which it was earned.     

(c) 
			 Participation in Benefit Plans  .  During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to receive all perquisites and participate in all benefit plans and programs maintained by the Company that are available generally to its senior leadership team;    provided, however,   that the Executive s right to participate in such plans and programs shall not affect the Company s right to amend or terminate the general applicability of such perquisites, plans and programs.  The Company may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, amend, eliminate or establish additional benefit programs as it deems appropriate.  Notwithstanding the Company s paid vacation policy, the Executive is eligible to receive 20 days of paid vacation per calendar year; provided, however, that the Executive s paid vacation for 2016 will be prorated to August 15, 2016.     

(d) 
			 Expenses  .  During the Term, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable travel and other business expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties to the Company in accordance with the Company s applicable expense reimbursement policies and procedures.      To the extent that any reimbursements payable to the Executive are subject to the provisions of Section 409A (as defined below):     (i)  all such reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by the Executive, (ii) the amount of expenses reimbursed in one taxable year will not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent taxable year, and (iii) the right to such reimbursement under this Agreement will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Company agrees that, in determining reasonable travel and other business expenses for the Executive, it will apply the same customary practices it applies in determining reasonable travel and other business expenses for the senior leadership team.         

4. 
			 Equity Compensation Awards  .        

(a) 
			 Restricted Stock Units  .  During the Term, the Executive will be eligible to participate in the Company s equity incentive compensation plan as in effect from time to time (the    RSU Plan   ).  Beginning on January 1, 2017 and continuing throughout the Term, the Executive shall be eligible for awards under the RSU Plan with the aggregate annual target value of such awards equal to $3,125,000, which will be granted pursuant to the terms of the RSU Plan as in effect from time to time and such other terms and conditions as determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.   Any awards to the Executive under the RSU Plan shall be evidenced by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Company s standard forms of award agreement applicable generally to the senior leadership team of the Company as in effect from time to time.    The Executive s RSU structure will be consistent with and no less favorable than that provided to the Company s senior leadership team.  Currently, the senior leadership team participates in a mix of  Part A  and  Part B  (as such terms are defined in the RSU Plan), and the specific structures of each are approved by the Compensation Committee and are modified from time to time.  The Executive s input will be sought when making recommendations on the mix between Part A and Part B;  provided that no more than 50% of any such grant would consist of Part B.

(b) 
			 Sign-on Restricted Stock Units  .  In addition to the Executive s participation in the RSU Plan as described in Section 4(a), the Executive shall be eligible to receive a special one-time grant of restricted stock units (the    Sign-on RSUs   ) on the first date of the Executive s employment hereunder with an aggregate value on the grant date thereof equal to $3,500,000.  Unless the Executive s employment is terminated by the Company with Cause (defined below), or due to the Executive s resignation for any reason prior to an applicable vesting date, the Sign-on RSUs shall vest according to the following schedule: shares having an aggregate value of $700,000 (i.e., twenty-percent (20%) of the aggregate Sign-on RSUs) shall vest on each of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2017,  calculated on each such vesting date based upon the average closing price of the Company s common stock over the last ten trading days prior to such date.    For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company terminates the Executive s employment without Cause at any time on or before December 31, 2017, the Sign-on RSUs shall, to the extent not already vested, continue to vest according to the schedule described above.  Moreover, the Sign-on RSUs shall vest in full on the date that is sixty (60) days following a Change of Control (defined below) of the Company provided that the Executive is employed by the Company at the time of such Change of Control.  At the Company s sole discretion, the Sign-on RSUs may be settled in cash or shares of the Company s common stock.  The Sign-on RSUs shall be evidenced the Company s standard form of restricted stock unit award agreement with such modifications as necessary to conform to the terms and conditions of this Section 4(b).

Reg.   1.409A-1(h).  The Company and the Executive intend that their exercise of authority or discretion under this Agreement shall comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (   Section 409A   ).

The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to obtain independent legal, tax or other counsel in connection with Section 409A. Each payment under this Agreement is intended to be a  separate payment  and not a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A.  Any payments or reimbursements of any expenses provided for under this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treas. Reg.   1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv).

Exhibit 10.6 

ZAYO GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. 

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS  (Sign-on Restricted Stock Units) 

These Standard Terms and Conditions apply to the Award of restricted stock units granted pursuant to the Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), which are evidenced by a Grant Notice or an action of the Committee that specifically refers to these Standard Terms and Conditions and are designated as    Sign-on Restricted Stock Units   .  In addition to these Standard Terms and Conditions, the restricted stock units shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, which are incorporated into these Standard Terms and Conditions by this reference.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan. 

1. 
			 TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS     

Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), has granted to the Participant named in the Grant Notice provided to said Participant herewith (the  Grant Notice ) an award of a number of restricted stock units (the  Award  or the  Restricted Stock Units ) with each Restricted Stock Unit representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 (the  Common Stock ) specified in the Grant Notice.  The Award is subject to the conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions, and the Plan, each as amended from time to time.  For purposes of these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Grant Notice, any reference to the Company shall include a reference to any Subsidiary. 

2. 
			 VESTING AND FORFEITURE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS     

The Award shall not be vested as of the Grant Date set forth in the Grant Notice and shall be forfeitable unless and until otherwise vested pursuant to the terms of the Grant Notice and these Standard Terms and Conditions.  After the Grant Date, subject to termination or acceleration as provided in these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Award shall become vested as described in the Grant Notice with respect to that number of Restricted Stock Units as set forth in the Grant Notice.  Restricted Stock Units that have vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture are referred to herein as  Vested RSUs.    

3. 
			 SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS     

Each Vested RSU will be settled by the delivery of one share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment under Section 14 of the Plan) to the Participant or, in the event of the Participant s death, to the Participant s estate, heir or beneficiary, promptly following the Vesting Date (but in no event later than 30 days following the Vesting Date); provided that the Participant has satisfied all of the tax withholding obligations described in Section 6 below, and that the Participant has completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Company deems appropriate to enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock.  The date upon which shares of Common Stock are to be issued under this Section 3 is referred to as the  Settlement Date.   The issuance of the shares of Common Stock hereunder may be effected by the issuance of a stock certificate, recording shares on the stock   

Exhibit 10.6 

records of the Company or by crediting shares in an account established on the Participant s behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as determined by the Company.  Fractional shares will not be issued pursuant to the Award.   

Notwithstanding the above, (i) the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period when the Company determines that the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any federal, state or other applicable laws, (ii) the Company may issue shares of Common Stock hereunder subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Company s counsel, are necessary to comply with securities or other regulatory requirements, and (iii) the date on which shares are issued hereunder may include a delay (which delay shall in no event extend beyond 30 days following the Vesting Date) in order to provide the Company such time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters.   

4. 
			 RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER     

Participant shall not be, nor have any of the rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of any RSUs unless and until shares of Common Stock settled for such RSUs shall have been issued by the Company to Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Grant Date and until the earlier of (a) the time when the Restricted Stock Units become vested and payable in accordance with the terms hereof or (b) the time when the Participant s right to receive Common Stock upon payment of Restricted Stock Units is forfeited, on the date that the Company pays a cash dividend (if any) to holders of Common Stock generally, the Participant shall be entitled to a number of additional whole Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) the product of (A) the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Common Stock on such date and (B) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including Dividend Equivalents paid thereon) previously credited to the Participant as of such date, by (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on such date.  Such Dividend Equivalents (if any) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled or forfeited in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units to which the Dividend Equivalents were credited. 

5. 
			 RESTRICTIONS ON RESALES OF SHARES     

The Company may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Vested RSUs, including without limitation (a) restrictions under an insider trading policy, (b) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and other holders and (c) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers.  

6. 
			 TAX WITHHOLDING     

The Company has the right to deduct or otherwise effect a withholding of the amount of any taxes (including, but not limited to, any FICA, FUTA, and similar taxes) required by federal,   

Exhibit 10.6 

state, local or foreign laws to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units; or, in lieu of such withholding, to require that the Grantee pay to the Company in cash (or, at the sole discretion of the Committee, in the form of shares of Common Stock or net settlement of the Award) the amount of any taxes required to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units.  Unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company or any affiliate are satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to issue a certificate for any of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Award (whether vested or unvested). 

7. 
			 NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARD     

The Participant understands, acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or as permitted by the Committee, the Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise directly or indirectly encumbered or disposed of other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.   

8. 
			 NON-COMPETE; NON-SOLICIT       

The Participant hereby agrees that during Participant s service with the Company and for a period of one year after Participant s Termination of Employment (the  Restricted Period ), Participant will not directly or indirectly engage or participate in (whether as an employee, consultant, proprietor, partner, director or otherwise) any position (i) of a business development/mergers and acquisitions nature, with any person, firm, corporation or business that engages in owning or operating fiber networks in the United States or other area or region in which the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate conducts business, or (ii) of a sales, sales management, sales engineering, marketing, product or network development nature, or any senior management level position,  if such position involves, directly or indirectly, products or services similar to the Company s being sold to one or more of the Company s top 200 customers at any time during the period between the Grant Date and the date on which a violation of this Section 8 occurs (a current list of such top 200 customers as of the Grant Date of this Award is attached hereto as Exhibit A), or (iii) any business in an area or region in which the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate conducts business as of the date the event occurs which is directly in competition with a business then conducted by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate.  In addition, during the Restricted Period, Participant will not (x) induce any customer or supplier of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, with which the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate has a business relationship, to curtail, cancel, not renew, or not continue his or her or its business with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or (y) induce, or attempt to influence, any employee of or service provider to the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate such employment or service, or (z) interfere with or harm, or attempt to interfere with or harm, the relationship of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate with any person who at any time was a customer or supplier of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate or otherwise had a business relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate or hire, solicit for hire or cause to be hired, either as an employee, contractor or consultant, any person who is currently employed, or was employed at any time during the six-month period prior thereto, as an employee, contractor or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8 shall not apply (i) in any case where the   

Exhibit 10.6 

Participant s Termination of Employment by the Company was not for Cause or (ii) at any time after expiration of the Restricted Period.  For avoidance of doubt, this Section 8 will apply in any case where the Participant voluntarily terminates service with the Company or where the Participant experiences a Termination of Employment with Cause.  In the event that Participant violates the terms of this Section 8, the Company shall provide Participant with written notice of such violation and all of Participant s Restricted Stock Units hereunder, including Vested RSUs, to the extent then outstanding, will be automatically, and without any further action on the part of the Company, forfeited as of the date of such written notice from Company. 

9. 
			 WAIVER OF CLAIMS       

By executing the Grant Notice, Participant hereby releases and discharges Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents or successors of and from any demands or claims, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, arising out of Participant s employment or other service with Company, including, but not limited to, claims of breach of express or implied contract, promissory estoppel, detrimental reliance, infliction of emotional distress, harassment and/or hostile work environment, claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the WARN Act, or claims of discrimination under the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Internal Revenue Code, New York Anti-Discrimination Act, or any other local, state or federal law or regulation, as of the Grant Date. 

10. 
			 OTHER AGREEMENTS SUPERSEDED     

The Grant Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the Participant and the Company regarding the Award.  Any prior agreements, commitments or negotiations concerning the Award are superseded. 

11. 

LIMITATION OF INTEREST IN SHARES SUBJECT TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS     

Neither the Participant (individually or as a member of a group) nor any beneficiary or other person claiming under or through the Participant shall have any right, title, interest, or privilege in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the purpose of the Plan or subject to the Grant Notice or these Standard Terms and Conditions except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, as shall have been issued to such person in connection with the Award.  Nothing in the Plan, in the Grant Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions or any other instrument executed pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the Company s employ or service nor limit in any way the Company s right to terminate the Participant s employment at any time for any reason. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, this Award is not intended to provide for a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and is intended to qualify for as a  short-term deferral  under Section 409A of   

Exhibit 10.6 

the Code, and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be construed or deemed to be amended as necessary to effect such intent.  Under no circumstances, however, shall the Company have any liability under the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions for any taxes, penalties or interest due on amounts paid or payable pursuant to the Plan or these Standard Terms and Conditions, including any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.   

(a) 

In the event that any provision of these Standard Terms and Conditions is declared to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be reformed, if possible, to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, or otherwise deleted, and the remainder of these Standard Terms and Conditions shall not be affected except to the extent necessary to reform or delete such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision.     

(b) 

The headings preceding the text of the sections hereof are inserted solely for convenience of reference, and shall not constitute a part of these Standard Terms and Conditions, nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect.     

(c) 

These Standard Terms and Conditions shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective permitted heirs, beneficiaries, successors and assigns.     

(d) 

These Standard Terms and Conditions shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.     

(e) 

In the event of any conflict between the Grant Notice, these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the Grant Notice and these Standard Terms and Conditions shall control.  In the event of any conflict between the Grant Notice and these Standard Terms and Conditions, the Grant Notice shall control.     

(f) 

All questions arising under the Plan or under these Standard Terms and Conditions shall be decided by the Committee in its total and absolute discretion.       

14. 
			 ELECTRONIC DELIVERY     

By executing the Grant Notice, the Participant hereby consents to the delivery of information (including, without limitation, information required to be delivered to the Participant pursuant to applicable securities laws) regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Plan, and the Restricted Stock Units via Company web site or other electronic delivery.
