NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

ZAP was incorporated in California in September, 1994 (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  ZAP Group ).  ZAP Group markets electric, alternative energy, and fuel efficient automobiles and commercial vehicles, motorcycles and scooters, and other forms of personal transportation. The Company s business strategy is to develop, acquire, and commercialize electric vehicles and electric vehicle power systems which the Company believes have fundamental practical and environmental advantages over available internal combustion modes of transportation and that can be produced commercially on an economically competitive basis.

In pursuit of a manufacturing plant and a partner with an existing product line, a distribution and customer support network in China, and experience in vehicle manufacturing, ZAP acquired a majority of the outstanding equity in Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co., Ltd. ( Jonway Auto ). The Company believes its 51% acquisition of Jonway Auto will enable it to access the rapidly-growing Chinese market for electric vehicles ( EV ) and to expand its EV business and distribution network around the world. The Company also believes Jonway Auto s ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility provides the competitive production capacity and resources to support production of ZAP Group s new line of electric SUV, minivan, and Neighborhood EV ( NEV ).

Jonway Auto is a limited liability company incorporated in Sanmen County, Zhejiang Province of the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ) on April 28, 2004 by Jonway Group Co., Ltd. ( Jonway Group ). Jonway Group is under the control of three individuals, Wang Huaiyi, Alex Wang (the son of Wang Huaiyi) and Wang Xiaoying (the daughter of Wang Huaiyi and all three individuals collectively referred to as the  Wang Family ).

ZAP has a wholly owned subsidiary, ZAP Hong Kong, a Hong Kong limited company. ZAP Hong Kong was established in 2011 as a wholly foreign owned enterprises ( WFOE ) and has no operation since incorporated. Jonway Auto established three wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely, Taizhou Selling Co., Ltd., focusing on vehicles marketing and distribution, Taizhou Fuxing Vehicle Sale Co., Ltd., focusing on minivan marketing and distribution in China, and Taizhou Vehicle Leasing Co., Ltd., focusing on the vehicle leasing business in Taizhou.

NOTE 2   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s current liabilities exceeded the current assets by approximately $70.9 million and its equity deficiency was $23.0 million, which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company has recurring net losses. Given the Company s expected capital expenditure in the foreseeable future, the Company has comprehensively considered its available sources of funds as follows:

Financial support and credit guarantee from related parties; and 

Other available sources of financing from domestic banks and other financial institutions given its credit history. 

The Company does not currently have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain its operations for the next twelve months. The Company plans to substantially increase its cash flows from operations and revenue derived from its products. If the Company s revenues do not reach the level anticipated in its plan and the Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In assessing the Company s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash on-hand, and its operating and capital expenditure commitments.  The Company s principal liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations.

8 

Jonway Auto intends to utilize its existing credit lines (see Note 7) to expand its electric vehicle business as well as other future vehicle models.  This includes on-going working capital needs, electric vehicle production equipment requirements, testing, homologation and new EV product molds. Also the Company s principal shareholder, Jonway Group, has agreed to provide the necessary support to meet the Company s financial obligations through September 30, 2017 in the event that the Company requires additional liquidity. In addition, China Electric Vehicle Corporation ( CEVC ) has renewed the convertible note with an extension through December 31, 2016 (see Note 8).  The Company does not intend to extend the term of this CEVC convertible note when it matures on December 31, 2016, and will most likely repay CEVC with Jonway Auto shares as per the terms and condition originally stipulated in the Convertible Note agreement.  With the conversion of the CEVC Convertible Note,  the additional equity investment into Jonway Auto would reduce ZAP s majority equity ownership in Jonway Auto. As a result, the qualification for ZAP to consolidate Jonway Auto would have to be reassessed based on ZAP s financial control, board and management control of Jonway Auto.

The Company will require additional capital to expand its current operations.  In particular, the Company requires additional capital to continue development of its electric vehicle business, to continue strengthening its dealer network and after-sale service centers and expanding its market initiatives.  The Company also requires financing the investment for the continued roll-out of new products and to add qualified sales and professional staff to execute on its business plan and pursue its efforts in the research and development of advanced technology vehicles, such as the new ZAP Alias, the electric and other fuel efficient vehicles.

The Company intends to fund its short and long term liquidity needs related to operations through the incurrence of indebtedness, equity financing or a combination of both.  The Company s ability to fund these needs will depend on its future performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors beyond its control, including trends in its industry and technological developments.

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of ZAP, and its subsidiaries, and are prepared in accordance with United States ( U.S. ) generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Management considers subsidiaries to be companies that are over 50% controlled. Significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation; profits from intercompany sales, are also eliminated; non-controlling interests are included in equity.  The Company accounts for its 37.5% interest in the ZAP Hangzhou and its 50% interest in Shanghai Zapple using the equity method of accounting because it has significant influence but not control. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the 2015 annual report on Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, contractual allowances and uncollectible accounts, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, stock based compensation, litigation and contingencies. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results and values may differ significantly from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenues for non-Jonway Auto sales when all of the following criteria have been met:

- 
  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. The Company generally relies upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. 

- 
 Sales price is fixed or determinable. The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.  

- 
 Delivery has occurred. The Company uses shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. The Company s customary shipping terms are FOB shipping point. 

- 
 Collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by the Company s credit checks and their payment histories. The Company records accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated customer returns. 

The Company records revenues for Jonway Auto sales only upon the occurrence of all of the following conditions:

- 
 The Company has received a binding purchase order from the customer or distributor authorized by a representative empowered to commit the purchaser (evidence of a sale); 

- 
 The purchase price has been fixed, based on the terms of the purchase order; 

- 
 The Company has delivered the product from its factory to a common carrier acceptable to the customer; and 

- 
 The Company deems the collection of the amount invoiced probable. 

The Company provides no price protection. Sales are recognized net of sale discounts, rebates and return allowances.

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 820,  Fair Value Measurements  and Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to use observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1: 
 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level 2: 
 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: 
 Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions and methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value. 

The carrying value of current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  The carrying value of the senior convertible debt (see Note 8), which approximates fair value, is influenced by interest rates and the Company s stock price, and is determined by prices for the convertible debts observed in market trading, which are Level 2 inputs.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary/investments, maintain their accounting records in United States Dollars ( US$ ) whereas Jonway Auto maintains its accounting records in the currency of Renminbi ( RMB ), being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.

Jonway Auto s principal country of operations is the PRC. The financial position and results of the Company s operations are determined using RMB, the local currency, as the functional currency.  The results of operations and the statement of cash flows denominated in foreign currency are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period.  Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date.  The equity denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution.  Due to the fact that cash flows are translated based on the average translation rate, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholder s equity as  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 

The value of RMB against US$ and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China s political and economic conditions, any significant revaluation of RMB may materially affect the Company s financial condition in terms of US$ reporting.  The following table outlines the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report:

NOTE 8 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT

Convertible debts are presented below:

(a) 
 Senior convertible debt - CEVC 

On January 12, 2011, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with China Electric Vehicle Corporation ( CEVC ), a British Virgin Island company whose sole shareholder is Cathaya Capital, L.P., and a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership ( Cathaya ).  Priscilla Lu was the former chairwoman of the board of directors of ZAP, a managing partner of Cathaya and a director of CEVC.

Pursuant to the Agreement, (i) CEVC purchased from the Company a Senior Secured Convertible Note (the  Note ) in the principal amount of $19 million, as amended; (ii) the Company issued to CEVC a warrant (the  Warrant ) exercisable for two years for the purchase up to 20 million shares of the Company s Common Stock at $0.50 per share, as amended;  (iii) the Company, certain investors and CEVC entered into an Amended and Restated Voting Agreement that amended and restated that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2009 that was previously granted to Cathaya Capital L.P.; (iv) the Company, certain investors and CEVC entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement that amended and restated that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2009, that was previously granted to Cathaya Capital L.P which grants certain registration rights relating to the Note and the Warrant; and (v) the Company and CEVC entered into a Security Agreement that secures the Note with all of the Company s assets other than those assets specifically excluded from the lien created by the Security Agreement.

16 

NOTE 8 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT   continued

The note is convertible upon the option of CEVC at any time, into (a) shares of Jonway Auto capital stock owned by ZAP at a conversion rate of 0.003743% of shares of Jonway Auto capital stock owned by ZAP for each $1,000 principal amount of the Note being converted; or (b) shares of ZAP common stock at a conversion rate of 4,435 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of the Note being converted.

This convertible note was extended until December 31, 2016 with interest accrual at 8% per annum with original maturing date of February 12, 2012. According to Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 470-10, the market interest should be imputed for the non-interest bearing loan between the related parties; therefore in the extended agreement the Convertible Note bears a market interest rate at 8%. With the new extension, the principal of $20.7 million has the same conversion terms to cash, and will also be convertible in part or in whole to shares of ZAP or Jonway Auto at maturity date or at any time with a 90 day notice. Beginning August 12, 2013 within 10 calendar days following the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company is required to pay Holder the Additional Interest accrued during such fiscal quarter by issuing the Holder or a party designated by the Holder, the number of shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to the Additional Interest accrued during such fiscal quarter divided by the average of the Closing Prices for each trading day during such fiscal quarter ending on (and including) the last Trading Day of such fiscal quarter. The Additional Interest Rate may be amended from time to time with the written consent of the Holder and the Company. In addition, the warrants issued in connection with the CEVC note were amended for the change of the terms of conversion and for the extension of the maturity date until December 31, 2016 (See Note 11).

Upon expiration date of the CEVC note on December 31, 2016, it is most likely that this convertible note will be repaid by ZAP in the form of Jonway Auto shares in order to reduce the liability of ZAP. If the CEVC note is repaid by Jonway Auto shares, ZAP s ownership of Jonway Auto would be reduced to less than majority interest, resulting in need to reconsider eligibility for consolidation.  Due to the increasing accumulation of debt from Jonway Auto, largely because of the lack of working capital to fulfill orders, Jonway Auto may seek equity funding in order to meet its operational financial needs.  If this were to happen, then the additional equity investment into Jonway Auto would also reduce ZAP s majority equity ownership in Jonway Auto. As a result, the qualification for ZAP to consolidate Jonway Auto would have to be reassessed based on ZAP's financial control, board and management control of Jonway Auto.

Interest expense related to CEVC convertible note for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $416,981 and $1,242,929, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $416,981 and $1,237,345, respectively. Accrued interest related to CEVC convertible note was $829,429 and $833,961, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

(b) 
 Convertible debt   Mr. Luo Hua Liang 

On September 3, 2015, the board approved issuance of a convertible note to Mr. Luo Hua Liang (the CEO s brother in-law) for his investment of RMB 5 million immediately deposited within one week of signing of the agreement and another investment up to RMB 5 million within one month of signing of the agreement. Both notes have one year terms at the interest rate of 12% per annum, and they have been extended one year to September 2017. The investment was transferred to Jonway Auto as the loan from the Company to Jonway Auto. The convertible note shall either be repaid in cash from Jonway Auto or be paid in ZAP shares. The convertible note s conversion price is $0.06 per share.  

Interest expense related to this convertible debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $22,437 and $68,199, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $7,078 and $7,078, respectively. Accrued interest related to CEVC convertible note was $96,852 and $30,133, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

The current board members remaining on the board are Alex Wang and Wang Huaiyi.

The principal activities of Jonway Auto until recently were the production and sales of gasoline models of the SUVs and minivans in China using the consigned UFO license from an affiliate of Jonway Group.  Over the past several years, Jonway Auto continued the production and sales of its gasoline model SUV and minivan, while developing and ramping production of its EV product line. Jonway Auto received type approval of its EV SUV and EV certification of its manufacturing facility from the Chinese government.  It also developed two different full electric EV models for its minivan, one with lithium batteries, which has longer range and more power, and the other with lead acid batteries, intended for lower speed and shorter range.  Jonway Auto began production on a new NEV, the  Urbee , in 2014 and 2015.  The primary market for the Urbee is the growing aging and young adult population in China that generally do not hold a driver s license.

ZAP and Jonway Auto are focused on the EV fleet markets in China. However, the market for EV fleet is challenged by the lack of working capital for the manufacturers to support lithium batteries.  The recent delay in subsidy payments by the central government for EV lithium batteries has created uncertainty in the EV market overall in China.  Without the fast turnaround on the subsidies for lithium batteries to support the working capital, the growth of electric vehicles for delivery minivan will slow down. Thus the revenue and sales of Jonway Auto will drop substantially. 

Jonway Auto s EV minivan is well-positioned for government city utility and maintenance transportation and service. The minivan was designed with removable rear seats so that it may also serve as a delivery van for use in the projected rapid growth market of EVs used for the transport of goods and packages in China. This EV minivan comes in both lithium battery configuration which is eligible for government subsidies as well as lead acid version which is much cheaper but is not eligible for subsidy.

ZAP and Jonway Auto s new EV product lines now include the A380 SUV EV, minivan EV, and the Urbee. Both the EV SUV and EV minivan products leverage the production moldings and the manufacturing engineering infrastructure and facilities currently in place for the gasoline models of these vehicles. The new Urbee started its first production delivery in 2014.  The first production deliveries of the EV SUV and Minivans occurred in 2015.

ZAP and Jonway Auto are seeking funding and partnerships to manage the sales and production demands of the EV fleet market in China.  Ultimately, the objective is to be able to build its own financial strength in order to sell and produce the whole EV minivan so that direct sales to major customers, partners or dealers can be achieved to further improve gross margins.  

25 

Our strategy in the longer term is to serve the growing fleet EV market with the EV minivan and EV SUV, with emphasis initially on the EV minivan for delivery market. While many electric vehicle companies are focused on passenger cars and sedans for mainstream consumers, ZAP and Jonway Auto believe government and corporate fleets can more quickly and more successfully deploy electric vehicles because they are more likely to have adequate charging infrastructure, service and support and the vehicles may travel along predictable routes and have a central point of operation. Fleet markets or delivery vehicles are more sensitive to the economics of fuel cost and when electric vehicles can be offered at comparable prices to gasoline vehicles, given the support of subsidies, the proposition to use EVs can be compelling for these markets.

The high cost of lithium battery EV power train has created working capital challenges for Jonway Auto. This represents more than 60 percent of the cost of the minivan EVs that are being produced.   Therefore without adequate working capital that is able to sustain a long payback period of over 18 months for reimbursements from the government for subsidies, the EV minivan market will be stalled for the time being.

With the demand for high working capital, outstanding liability that Jonway Auto has accrued and the lack of bank financing because of Chinese bank credit crunch, ZAP and Jonway Auto are looking at several options to address the financial needs and outstanding liabilities.  Jonway Auto may in the future be looking for equity financing in China which may reduce ZAP s majority ownership of Jonway Auto.  Therefore, ZAP is considering reorganizing the company to reduce the financial burdens of the bank loans and supplier payables that were carried over from the gasoline vehicle business under Jonway Auto and separating this from the business associated with the sales and marketing of EVs produced by Jonway and potentially with other partner companies  electric vehicles, such as the recent agreement signed with Dong Feng Automobile for the EV minivans. Currently the sales and marketing organization of Jonway Auto is under a separate subsidiary of Jonway Auto, and this may be retained by ZAP while reorganizing the manufacturing production arm of Jonway Auto. The repayment of the CEVC convertible note would also reduce the outstanding liability of ZAP, while maintaining control of the sales and marketing of Jonway Auto s business with the sales subsidiary.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth, as a percentage of net sales, certain items included in ZAP s condensed consolidated statements of operations (see Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes) for the periods indicated:

These results of operations that have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that include the results of operations of Jonway Auto since the date of ZAP s acquisition of 51% of the equity shares of Jonway Auto on January 21, 2011.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Net sales  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.3 million as compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease of sales was mainly due to the intense competitions in the auto market.

Jonway Auto s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $3.81 million from $7.09 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 compared to $3.28 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

The sales volume decreased because of the decline in sales for SUV and Urbee.  The sales of SUV decreased by $2.9 million from $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $Nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   The sales of Urbee decreased by $2.5 million from $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $Nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  However, the sales for  EV minivans  increased significantly, from $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

The increased sales of EV minivans provided strong confidence to the Company to continue focus on  the EV fleet markets in China. With the continued and more effective incentives made by the China government for both manufacturers and consumers, as well as the increased awareness of improving air quality, the Company believes that it EV SUV and EV minivan products have substantial market opportunities in China, and the sales of these products are expected to continue grow rapidly in the following years. 

Gross loss  increased by $185,000 from a gross loss of $194,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a gross loss of $379,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Our margins decreased from (2.71)% to (11.53)%.  The decrease of the gross loss was primarily due to the decrease in sales and increase in cost per unit.

Jonway Auto s gross loss increased by $191,000 from a gross loss $189,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a gross loss of $380,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The sales volume for both SUV and Urbee dropped significantly in three months ended September 30, 2016 in comparing with the same period last year.

Sales and marketing expenses  decreased $0.4 million from $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease was mainly due to the less marketing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The percentage of sales and marketing expense to net sales increased from 12.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 13.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the decrease in net sales.

General and administrative expenses  decreased by $0.1 million from $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $2.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The General and administration expenses for three months ended September 30, 2015 were consistent with the same period last year.

Research and development expenses  increased by $46,000 from $38,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $84,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase was mainly due to more research and development activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Interest expense, net  decreased by $21,000 from $646,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $625,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease was due to the lower borrowing rate.

Other income  increased by $8,000 from $374,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $382,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Other income remained consistent with the same period in prior year.

Net loss  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.3 million compared to $3.7 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above.

27 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

Net sales  decreased by $11.3 million to $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $20.9 million in September 30, 2015.  The decrease of sales was mainly due to the intense competitions in the auto market.

Jonway Auto s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $11 million from $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The sales volume decreased because of the decline in sales for SUV and Urbee.  The sales of SUV decreased by $8.5 million from $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The sales of Urbee decreased by $7.41 million from $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.09 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  However, the sales for  EV minivans  increased significantly, from $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The increased sales of EV minivans provided strong confidence to the Company to continue focus on  the EV fleet markets in China. With the continued and more effective incentives made by the China government for both manufacturers and consumers, as well as the increased awareness of improving air quality, the Company believes that it EV SUV and EV minivan products have substantial market opportunities in China, and the sales of these products are expected to continue grow rapidly in the following years. 

Gross loss  increased by $0.06 million from a gross loss of $0.98 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a gross loss of $1.04 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase of the gross loss was primarily due to the decrease in sales and increase in cost per unit.

Jonway Auto s gross loss decreased by $0.01 million from a gross loss $1.05 million for the first nine months of 2015 to a gross loss of $1.04 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in gross loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was principally related to the higher profits on the sales of EV minivans.

Sales and marketing expenses  in the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $1.3 million from $2.8 million in 2015 to $1.5 million in 2016.  The decrease was mainly due to the less marketing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of sales, the expense increased from 13.37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 15.53% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

General and administrative expenses  decreased by approximately $0.9 million, from $6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due the less spending on general and administrative activities for expense saving purpose.

Research and development expenses  decreased by $1.5 million from $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease was mainly due to the less research and development activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016

Interest expense, net  decreased by $0.2 million from an interest expense of $2.1 million for the first nine months of 2015 to interest expense of $1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was due to the lower borrowing rate.

Other income  decreased $0.1 million from $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other income remained consistent with the same period in prior year.

Net loss  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.1 million compared to $13.9 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States ( U.S. ) generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, contractual allowances and uncollectible accounts, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, stock based compensation, litigation and contingencies. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results and values may differ significantly from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenues for non-Jonway Auto sales when all of the following criteria have been met:

-         Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. The Company generally relies upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. 

-         Sales price is fixed or determinable. The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.  

-         Delivery has occurred. The Company uses shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. The Company s customary shipping terms are FOB shipping point. 

-         Collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by the Company s credit checks and their payment histories. The Company records accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated customer returns. 

The Company records revenues for Jonway Auto sales only upon the occurrence of all of the following conditions:

-         The Company has received a binding purchase order from the customer or distributor authorized by a representative empowered to commit the purchaser (evidence of a sale); 

-         The purchase price has been fixed, based on the terms of the purchase order; 

-         The Company has delivered the product from its factory to a common carrier acceptable to the customer; and 

-         The Company deems the collection of the amount invoiced probable. 

- 
 The Company provides no price protection. Sales are recognized net of sale discounts, rebates and return allowances.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to provide guidance  on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The guidance specifically addresses cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the diversity in practice. The guidance will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2018, but early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra - Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.

The amendments are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, to provide guidance on the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by amending how a reporting entity, that is a single decision maker of a VIE, treats indirect interests in that entity held through related parties that are under common control.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded the current assets by approximately $70.9 million and our equity deficiency was $23.0 million, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, we have recurring net losses. Given our expected capital expenditure in the foreseeable future, we have comprehensively considered our available sources of funds as follows:

Financial support and credit guarantee from related parties; and 

Other available sources of financing from domestic banks and other financial institutions given our credit history. 

The Company does not currently have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain its operations for the next twelve months. The Company plans to substantially increase our cash flows from operations and revenue derived from our products. If the Company s revenues do not reach the level anticipated in our plan and the Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay our debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand, and our operating and capital expenditure commitments.  Our principal liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations.

In June 2015, the Company was approved for up to an aggregate of $6.9 million of a credit line from China Everbright Bank with 50% restricted cash deposited and credit exposure of $3.5 million. The Company renewed the agreement in June 2016 and the renewed agreement expires in June 2017.  The credit line is secured by  a land use right and a building with a total carrying amount of $2.1 million. Three shareholders and  the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )  also personally guaranteed on this credit line.   As of September 30, 2016, $6.0 million was drawn down as notes payable from China Everbright Bank.  The amount of restricted cash deposited with the bank was $3.0 million. As of September 30, 2016,   the unused line of credit was approximately $0.45 million. 

In March 2014, the Company has obtained up to an aggregate of $15.0 million of credit line with the credit exposure of $5.5 million from CITIC Sanmen Branch through Jonway Auto.  The credit line was extended for one more year and expires in November 2016. The credit line is secured by land and building owned by Jonway Auto and guaranteed by the related party   Jonway Group.   The shareholder and the CEO also personally guaranteed this credit line.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed aggregated $5.5 million loans with various due dates in March 25, 2017 to April 26, 2017 from CITIC Sanmen Branch. The loans carried at annual interests of 6.0%.  The Company has also drawn down $4.0 million in the form of notes payable as of September 30, 2016.  The Company deposited $4.0 million restricted cash as collateral for these notes payable. These notes are due from in March 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, the line of credit has been fully utilized. 

The Company has qualified for an aggregate of $5.0 million of a credit line from ICBC. This credit line is secured by land and buildings owned by Jonway Auto and guaranteed by related parties.  The credit line expires in March 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, the total outstanding loan under this credit line was $4.5 million. The annual interest rates are from 4.36% to 6.66%.  The loans are due in various dates through  July 22, 2017 . As of September 30, 2016, the unused line of credit was approximately $0.45 million. 

Jonway Auto intends to utilize the above credit lines to expand its electric vehicle business as well as other future vehicle models.  This includes on-going working capital needs, electric vehicle production equipment requirements, testing, homologation and new EV product molds. Also the Company s principal shareholder, Jonway Group, has agreed to provide the necessary support to meet the Company s financial obligations through September 30, 2017 in the event that the Company requires additional liquidity. In addition, China Electric Vehicle Corporation ( CEVC ) has renewed the convertible note with an extension through December 31, 2016.  The Company does not intend to extend the term of this CEVC convertible note when it matures on December 31, 2016, and will most likely repay CEVC with Jonway Auto shares as per the terms and condition originally stipulated in the Convertible Note agreement.  With the conversion of the CEVC Convertible Note, the additional equity investment into Jonway Auto would reduce ZAP's majority equity ownership in Jonway Auto. As a result, the qualification for ZAP to consolidate Jonway Auto would have to be reassessed based on ZAP's financial control, board and management control of Jonway Auto.

31 

The Company will require additional capital to expand its current operations.  In particular, the Company requires additional capital to continue development of its electric vehicle business, to continue strengthening its dealer network and after-sale service centers and expanding its market initiatives.  The Company also requires financing the investment for the continued roll-out of new products and to add qualified sales and professional staff to execute on its business plan and pursue its efforts in the research and development of advanced technology vehicles, such as the new ZAP Alias, the electric and other fuel efficient vehicles.

The Company intends to fund its long term liquidity needs related to operations through the incurrence of indebtedness, equity financing or a combination of both.  The Company s ability to fund these needs will depend on its future performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors beyond its control, including trends in its industry and technological developments.  

32 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

None.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

As a smaller reporting, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item 3.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

As discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified a lack of sufficient control in the area of technical competency in review and approval of financial reporting processes. This control weakness allowed for reconciliations, reports and other documents to be insufficiently reviewed prior to being approved by management and audit adjustments to be identified by our auditors as part of their year-end audit work. This material weakness resulted in errors in the recording of non-routine and complex accounting transactions in the preparation of our annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company is considering utilizing outside accounting experts to assist us in accounting for future complex transactions.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co- Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

No significant changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting during this quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

ZAP is in arrears with the settlement payment to Hogan   Lovells. The current negotiated balance due is $779,500.  Hogan   Lovells agreed to reduce the total amount owed by $453,827, as long as we did not default on our payment agreement. If Hogan   Lovells does seek a judgment, the total balance due immediately would be $1,233,327, recorded by the Company in its books and records. Currently ZAP is seeking additional funding, and is working with prospective investors or lenders so ZAP can resume the installment payments to Hogan   Lovells.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company accrued approximately $1.2 million for this litigation.
