Note 1.  Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  OUTFRONT Media Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries (collectively,  we,   us  or  our ) is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) which provides advertising space ( displays ) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the  U.S. ) and Canada. Our portfolio includes billboard displays, which are predominantly located in densely populated major metropolitan areas and along high-traffic expressways and major commuting routes. We also have a number of exclusive multi-year contracts to operate advertising displays in municipal transit systems. We have displays in all of the   25   largest markets in the U.S. and over   150   markets across the U.S. and Canada. We currently manage our operations through   three   operating segments (1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our   U.S. Media   reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing.  
    
  On April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the  Disposition ), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America (see Note 10.   Acquisitions and Dispositions  :   Dispositions   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of our management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain reclassifications of prior year s data have been made to conform to the current period s presentation. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and notes thereto, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016  .  
    
  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Note 2.  New Accounting Standards 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (the  FASB s ) principles-based guidance addressing the recognition of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability.  We elected to adopt the guidance on a retrospective basis. As a result,   $26.0 million   of debt issuance costs was recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of our debt liability on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $4.4 million   from   Other current assets   and   $25.3 million   from   Other assets   was reclassified to   Long-term debt, net  , on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015. Regarding line-of-credit arrangements, we continue to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. This guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted the FASB s guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. We elected to adopt the guidance on a prospective basis. This guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements. 
    
  Recent Pronouncements 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted and must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Stock Compensation 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies accounting for share-based compensation. The difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting on share-based payment awards (excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies, including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the statement of operations. Excess tax benefits should be classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. An entity may choose to either continue to accrue forfeitures based on the number of awards expected to vest or can account for forfeitures as they occur. The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in applicable jurisdictions. Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Each individual amendment is to be applied using either a prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective basis, as required. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted and must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance addressing the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In May 2014 (updated in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016), the FASB issued principles-based guidance addressing revenue recognition issues. The guidance will be applied to all contracts with customers regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. The guidance requires that the amount of revenue a company should recognize reflect the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods and services. This guidance is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 3.  Property and Equipment 
    
  The table below presents the balances of major classes of assets and accumulated depreciation. 

Depreciation expense was   $26.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $28.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Depreciation expense was   $84.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $85.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  

Note 4.  Intangible Assets 
    
  Our identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of acquired permits and leasehold agreements, franchise agreements which grant us the right to operate out-of-home structures in specified locations and the right to provide advertising space on railroad and municipal transit properties. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is the respective life of the agreement that in some cases includes historical experience of renewals. 
    
  Our identifiable intangible assets consist of the following: 

All of our identifiable intangible assets, except goodwill, are subject to amortization. Amortization expense was   $28.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $29.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of   $9.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $9.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Amortization expense was   $87.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $86.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which includes the amortization of direct lease acquisition costs of   $28.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $26.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Direct lease acquisition costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related customer lease term, which generally ranges from four weeks to one year.

Note 5.  Asset Retirement Obligation 
    
  The following table sets forth the change in the asset retirement obligations associated with our advertising structures located on leased properties.   The obligation is calculated based on the assumption that all of our advertising structures will be removed within the next 50 years.   The estimated annual costs to dismantle and remove the structures upon the termination or non-renewal of our leases are consistent with our historical experience.  

Note 6.  Related Party Transactions 
    
  We have a   50%   ownership interest in   two   joint ventures that operate transit shelters in the greater Los Angeles area and Vancouver, and   three   joint ventures which operate a total of   15   billboard displays in New York and Boston. All of these ventures are accounted for as equity investments. These investments totaled   $23.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $21.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , and are included in   Other assets   on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We provided sales and management services to these joint ventures and recorded management fees in   Revenues   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations of   $1.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $2.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $5.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $5.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Term Loan 
    
  The interest rate on the term loan due in 2021 (the  Term Loan ) was   3.0%   per annum as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , a discount of   $1.1 million   on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through   Interest expense, net  , on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  On October 31, 2016, we made an additional discretionary payment of   $10.0 million   on the Term Loan. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a discount of   $0.5 million   on   $150.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5.250%   Senior Unsecured Notes due   2022  , remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through   Interest expense, net,   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a premium of   $3.1 million   on   $100.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5.625%   Senior Unsecured Notes due   2024  , remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through   Interest expense, net  , on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  We also have a   $425.0 million   revolving credit facility, which matures in   2019   (the  Revolving Credit Facility ).  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
    
  The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was   $0.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $0.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , and   $1.4 million   in each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately   $31.7 million   against the Revolving Credit Facility.  
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The credit agreement dated January 31, 2014 (the  Credit Agreement ), governing the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company s and our subsidiaries  abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company s or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC s ( Finance LLC s ) capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers.  
    
  The terms of the Credit Agreement require that, as long as any commitments remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0.   As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was   1.3   to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement.   The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0.   As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was   4.8   to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with our debt covenants. 
    
  Letter of Credit Facility 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we issued letters of credit totaling approximately   $66.2 million   under our   $80.0 million   letter of credit facility. The fee under the letter of credit facility was immaterial in each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

     Table of Contents        
  OUTFRONT Media Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

Effective October 21, 2016, we temporarily reduced our   $80.0 million   letter of credit facility by   $12.0 million   to   $68.0 million  , as we are in the process of bifurcating our letter of credit facility for administrative purposes. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had deferred   $28.5 million   in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through   Interest expense, net,   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. 
    
  Fair Value 
    
  Under the fair value hierarchy, observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are defined as Level 1; observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability are defined as Level 2; and unobservable inputs for the asset or liability are defined as Level 3. The aggregate fair value of our debt, which is estimated based on quoted market prices of similar liabilities, was approximately   $2.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of our debt is classified as Level 2.  

Note 8.  Equity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   450,000,000   shares of our common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, were authorized;   138,037,327   shares were issued and outstanding; and   50,000,000   shares of our preferred stock, par value   $0.01   per share, were authorized with   no   shares issued and outstanding. 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   79,690   shares, valued at approximately   $1.9 million  , of our common stock to Videri Inc. ( Videri ) in connection with licenses and services received under a development and license agreement (the  Videri Agreement ) with Videri and J M Holding Enterprises, Inc. We have capitalized the payments, which are related to the development of software and equipment to be utilized within digital displays, as construction in progress within   Property and equipment, net  , on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
    
  On   October 27, 2016  , we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.34   per share on our common stock, payable on   December 30, 2016  , to stockholders of record at the close of business on   December 9, 2016  . 

Note 9.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  On April 1, 2016, in connection with the Disposition, we recognized   $99.9 million   in unrealized foreign currency translation losses. These losses were previously included in the carrying value of the outdoor advertising business in Latin America, resulting in a   Loss on real estate assets held for sale   in the fourth quarter of 2015. (See Note 10.   Acquisitions and Dispositions  :   Dispositions   to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Dispositions 
    
  The Disposition was completed on   April 1, 2016  , and in connection with the Disposition, we received   $82.0 million   in cash plus working capital, which is subject to post-closing adjustments. We recorded a loss on real estate assets held for sale of approximately   $1.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the Disposition, the assets and liabilities of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America had been classified as   Assets held for sale   and   Liabilities held for sale   on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2015. The components of   Assets held for sale   and   Liabilities held for sale,   which were written off upon completion of the Disposition, were as follows: 

(a) 
    Loss on real estate assets held for sale   is primarily comprised of the impact of including unrecognized foreign currency translation adjustment losses in the carrying value of assets held for sale.

Note 12.  Retirement Benefits 
    
  The following table presents the components of net periodic pension cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for our pension plans:  

(a) 
    Reflects amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income. 
       
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $1.6 million   to our pension plans. In   2016  , we expect to contribute approximately   $2.1 million   to our pension plans. 

Note 13.  Income Taxes 
    
  We are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) and, accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distributed to our stockholders. We have elected to treat our subsidiaries that participate in certain non-REIT qualifying activities, and our foreign subsidiaries, as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). As such, we have provided for their federal, state and foreign income taxes. 
    
  Our effective income tax rate represents a combined annual effective tax rate for federal, state, local and foreign taxes applied to interim operating results.  
    
  In the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction, the impact of state and local taxes, and the effect of foreign operations.  

Note 14.  Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) 

(a) 
    The potential impact of an aggregate   0.2 million   granted RSUs, PRSUs and stock options in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   0.6 million   granted RSUs, PRSUs and stock options in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   0.5 million   granted RSUs, PRSUs and stock options in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   0.1 million   granted RSUs, PRSUs and stock options in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , were antidilutive.

Note 15.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Our off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that are payable over several years. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  We have long-term operating leases for office space, billboard sites and equipment, which expire at various dates. Certain leases contain renewal and escalation clauses. 
    
  We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 
    
  We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, including within the sports venues, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 
    
  On July 22, 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the  MTA ) to extend our existing transit contract for providing advertising services throughout the New York City subway system from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on or after July 1, 2016. On July 22, 2015, we also entered into an agreement with the MTA to modify our existing bus and commuter rail advertising contract to change the MTA s right to terminate the contract at any time, to a right to terminate at any time on or after July 1, 2016, and the right to exclude billboards on the MTA s properties from any termination. The MTA has issued a  Request for Proposals  to prospective operators for the subway, bus and commuter rail (Metro-North and Long Island Railroad) concessions, in any combination, each for a ten-year contract, with an additional five-year renewal period at the MTA s option. On May 18, 2016, we submitted a response to the MTA. In mid-October, the MTA issued a follow-up request that refined its timeline and bid requirements, particularly relating to digital deployment and the communications platform. We are currently working on this next bid submission. Accordingly, on November 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the MTA to extend the expiration of our existing contracts for transit advertising services from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on 90 days  notice. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , several marketing and multimedia rights contracts were renewed, resulting in additional guaranteed minimum annual payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , guaranteed minimum annual payments are as follows:

Letters of Credit 
    
  We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated   $119.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and were not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  On an ongoing basis, we are engaged in lawsuits and governmental proceedings and respond to various investigations, inquiries, notices and claims from national, state and local governmental and other authorities (collectively,  litigation ). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in our opinion, none of our current litigation is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Note 16.  Segment Information 
    
  Effective April 1, 2016, we changed the segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from the Disposition and recent acquisitions, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy. We currently manage our operations through   three   operating segments (1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our   U.S. Media   reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in other. Our new segment reporting therefore includes   U.S. Media   and other.  
    
  The following tables set forth our financial performance by segment. Historical financial information by reportable segment has been recast to reflect the changes in segment reporting with no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements. Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America (see Note 10.   Acquisitions and Dispositions  :   Dispositions   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Historical operating results for our advertising business in Latin America are included in other.   

We present   Operating income (loss)   before   Depreciation  ,   Amortization  ,   Net (gain) loss on dispositions,     Stock-based compensation,     Restructuring charges   and   Loss on real estate assets held for sale   ( Adjusted OIBDA ) as the primary measure of profit and loss for our segments in accordance with the FASB guidance for segment reporting.

  We and our material existing and future direct and indirect   100%   owned domestic subsidiaries (except Finance LLC and Outfront Media Capital Corporation, the borrowers under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility) guarantee the obligations under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. Our senior unsecured notes are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us and each of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantees the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 7.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on   February 29, 2016  , and the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  This MD A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in the sections entitled  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016  , and the section entitled  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements  .    Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to (i)  the Company,   we,   our,   us  and  our company  mean OUTFRONT Media Inc., a Maryland corporation, and unless the context requires otherwise, its consolidated subsidiaries, and (ii) the  25 largest markets in the U.S.,   over   150   markets in the U.S. and Canada  and  Nielsen Designated Market Areas  are based, in whole or in part, on Nielsen Media Research s Designated Market Area rankings as of January 1, 2016.  

Overview 
    
  We are a real estate investment trust ( REIT ), which provides advertising space ( displays ) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the  U.S. ) and Canada. We currently manage our operations through   three   operating segments (1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our   U.S. Media   reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in other (see Note 16.   Segment Information   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America.  
    
  On April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the  Disposition ), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. (See Note 10.   Acquisitions and Dispositions  :   Dispositions   to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The operating results of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America through April 1, 2016, are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, and are included in other in our segment reporting.  
    
  Business 
    
  We are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas ( DMAs ), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and over   150   markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser s website or retail location  one mile down the road.   
    
  Using Geopath Out of Home Ratings, the out-of-home advertising industry s audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our recently launched ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location.  
    
  We believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are ALWAYS ON , are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective  stand-alone  medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio and print. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our  
  
   30  

     Table of Contents  

customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, creative design support, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for the majority of our business.  
    
  U.S. Media.    Our   U.S. Media   segment generated   25%   of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   26%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , and generated   16%   in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   16%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Our   U.S. Media   segment generated   25%   of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   27%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , and generated   16%   in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   15%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our   U.S. Media   segment generated   $356.7 million   of   Revenues   and   $129.3 million   of   Operating income   before   Depreciation  ,   Amortization  ,   Net (gain) loss on dispositions,     Stock-based compensation,     Restructuring charges   and   Loss on real estate assets held for sale   ( Adjusted OIBDA ). In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , our   U.S. Media   segment generated   $346.3 million   of   Revenues   and   $121.0 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our   U.S. Media   segment generated   $1,025.8 million   of   Revenues   and   $347.9 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , our   U.S. Media   segment generated   $988.2 million   of   Revenues   and   $331.5 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. (See the  Segment Results of Operations  section of this MD A.) 
    
  Other   (includes International and Sports Marketing).  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Other   generated   $26.1 million   of   Revenues   and   $2.2 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  ,   Other   generated   $40.4 million   of   Revenues   and   $4.5 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   Other   generated   $90.7 million   of   Revenues   and   $12.8 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   Other   generated   $127.1 million   of   Revenues   and   $17.0 million   of Adjusted OIBDA. 
    
  Economic Environment 
    
  Our revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control.  
    
  Business Environment 
    
  The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for customers, structures and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional platforms such as, broadcast and cable television, radio, print media and direct mail marketers. Increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our most heavily trafficked locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital billboard displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital billboard displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production costs. In addition, digital billboard displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display (up to eight per minute). As a result, digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays, and digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays.  
    
  Our revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season. 
    
  We have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our largest categories of advertisers were   television  ,   retail   and   healthcare/pharmaceuticals  , which represented   10%  ,   7%   and   7%   of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, respectively. During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , our largest categories of advertisers were television, retail and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 11%, 8% and 6% of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our largest categories of advertisers were   television  ,   retail   and   healthcare/pharmaceuticals  , which represented   8%  ,   8%   and   7%   of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , our largest categories of advertisers were television, retail and healthcare/pharmaceuticals, which represented 9%, 9% and 7% of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

Our large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   47%   of our   U.S. Media   segment revenues from national advertising campaigns compared to approximately   49%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   46%   of our   U.S. Media   segment revenues from national advertising campaigns compared to approximately   47%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Our transit business requires us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain new contracts. In November 2014, we were informed that we were not successful in our bid to renew the New York City phone kiosk contract, which we obtained as part of the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses of Van Wagner Communications, LLC on October 1, 2014, and our operation of these kiosks ceased during the first quarter of 2015. In the three months ended March 31, 2015, we generated revenue of $1.6 million related to these operations.  
    
  On July 22, 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the  MTA ) to extend our existing transit contract for providing advertising services throughout the New York City subway system from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on or after July 1, 2016. On July 22, 2015, we also entered into an agreement with the MTA to modify our existing bus and commuter rail advertising contract to change the MTA s right to terminate the contract at any time, to a right to terminate at any time on or after July 1, 2016, and the right to exclude billboards on the MTA s properties from any termination. Our transit contract with the MTA represents   57%   of our   U.S. Media   segment transit and other revenues, or   18%   of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and represents   57%   of our   U.S. Media   segment transit and other revenues, or   18%   of our total   U.S. Media   segment revenues, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The MTA has issued a  Request for Proposals  to prospective operators for the subway, bus and commuter rail (Metro-North and Long Island Railroad) concessions, in any combination, each for a ten-year contract, with an additional five-year renewal period at the MTA s option. On May 18, 2016, we submitted a response to the MTA. In mid-October, the MTA issued a follow-up request that refined its timeline and bid requirements, particularly relating to digital deployment and the communications platform. We are currently working on this next bid submission. Accordingly, on November 7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the MTA to extend the expiration of our existing contracts for transit advertising services from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the MTA on 90 days  notice. 

Key Performance Indicators 
    
  Our management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below. 
    
  Several of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

(a) 
    Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues ). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

    See the  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  and  Revenues  sections of this MD A for reconciliations of   Operating income   to Adjusted OIBDA,   Net income   to FFO and AFFO, and   Revenues   to organic revenues.  
       
  Adjusted OIBDA 
    
  We calculate Adjusted OIBDA as   Operating income (loss)   before   Depreciation  ,   Amortization  ,   Net (gain) loss on dispositions,     Stock-based compensation,     Restructuring charges   and   Loss on real estate assets held for sale  . We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management s opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  
    
  FFO and AFFO 
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). FFO reflects net income (loss) adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, the non-cash effect of loss on real estate assets held for sale and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis.  AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes costs related to restructuring charges, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred financing costs, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO, AFFO, and related per weighted average share amounts, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management s opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs.  
    
  Since Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO and, as applicable, related per weighted average share amounts, are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for,   Operating income (loss)  ,   Net income (loss)  ,   Revenues   and   Net income (loss) per common share   for basic and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.

  FFO in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , of   $81.9 million   increased   16%   compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due higher net income. AFFO       in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $87.2 million  , an increase of   26%   compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher deferred income taxes, higher net income, decreased direct lease acquisition costs, lower maintenance capital expenditures and higher stock-based compensation. FFO in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , of   $209.6 million   increased   9%   compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher net income, increased amortization of direct lease acquisition costs and a loss on real estate assets held for sale. AFFO       in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $217.2 million  , an increase of   14%   compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher net income, increased amortization of direct lease acquisition costs, a loss on real estate assets held for sale, lower maintenance capital expenditures, lower restructuring charges and higher stock-based compensation.  

Analysis of Results of Operations 
    
  Revenues 
    
  We derive   Revenues   primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period. For space provided to advertisers through the use of an advertising agency whose commission is calculated based on a stated percentage of gross advertising spending, our   Revenues   are reported net of agency commissions.

    Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with significant acquisitions and divestitures, revenues associated with business lines we no longer operate, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates ( non-organic revenues ).  
              (b) 
    Revenues on a constant dollar basis are calculated as reported revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We provide constant dollar revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between periods, which are not under management s direct control. Our management believes constant dollar revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since constant dollar revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Constant dollar revenues, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 
       
  Total revenues decreased   $3.9 million  , or   1.0%  , and organic revenues increased   $8.6 million  , or   2%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. Total revenues increased   $1.2 million   and organic revenues increased   $34.4 million  , or   3%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. In constant dollars, revenues increased   $6.4 million  , or   1%  , and organic revenues increased   $34.4 million  , or   3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. 
    
  Non-organic revenues primarily reflects acquisitions and dispositions, and the discontinuation of a business line in the first quarter of 2015.  
    
  Total billboard revenues decreased   $7.8 million  , or   3%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, principally driven by the impact of the Disposition and lower performance in Canada, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays. Total billboard revenues decreased   $10.8 million  , or   1%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, principally driven by the impact of the Disposition, lower performance in Canada, the impact of the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015 and foreign currency exchange losses of   $4.5 million  , partially offset by an increase in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays. In constant dollars, billboard revenues decreased   $6.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period.

The increases in organic billboard revenues in the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year periods, are due to increases in average revenue per display (yield) and the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by lower performance in Canada. 
    
  Total transit and other revenues increased   $3.9 million  , or   4%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, driven by stronger market conditions in local advertising, the impact of an acquisition and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition and a reduction in national advertising revenues. Total transit and other revenues increased   $12.0 million  , or   4%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, driven by stronger market conditions in local advertising, the impact of an acquisition and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period, partially offset by lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events, the impact of the Disposition and a reduction in national advertising revenues.

  Operating Expenses 

Billboard property lease expenses represented   33%   of billboard revenues in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   34%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Transit franchise expenses represented   60%   of transit revenues in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   61%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased by   $3.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. Billboard property lease expenses represented   34%   of billboard revenues in each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. Transit franchise expenses represented   62%   of transit revenues in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   63%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased by   $2.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. The decrease in billboard property lease costs in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to the impact of the

  The increase in transit franchise expenses in the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to the increase in transit revenues, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (decreases of   $1.0 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and   $2.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year periods). 
    
  Posting, maintenance and other expenses decreased   $4.3 million  , or   7%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. Posting, maintenance and other expenses decreased   $9.5 million  , or   5%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. The decreases in posting, maintenance and other expenses in the three months and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior year periods, were primarily due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $5.6 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and   $11.7 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016). 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG A ) 
    
  SG A expenses represented   17%   of   Revenues   in each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. SG A expenses decreased   $2.1 million  , or   3%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $3.6 million  ) and lower professional fees, including non-recurring legal costs in 2015, partially offset by increased sales and other compensation-related expenses, and lower administrative costs. SG A expenses represented   18%   of   Revenues   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   17%   in the same prior-year period. SG A expenses increased   $3.1 million  , or   2%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to increased sales and other compensation-related expenses, higher professional fees, partially offset by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $8.1 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same prior-year periods), lower administrative costs and non-recurring legal costs in 2015. 
    
  Depreciation 
    
  Depreciation   decreased   $1.7 million  , or   6%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards.   Depreciation   decreased   $0.8 million  , or   1%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to the impact of the Disposition, partially offset by higher depreciation associated with the increased number of digital billboards. 
    
  Amortization 
    
  Amortization   decreased   $0.8 million  , or   3%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, principally driven by decreased direct lease acquisition costs of   $9.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.4 million   in the same prior-year period. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were   $9.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $9.4 million   in the same prior-year period.   Amortization   increased   $0.9 million  , or   1%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, principally driven by increased direct lease acquisition costs of   $28.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $26.1 million   in the same prior-year period, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets. Capitalized direct lease acquisition costs were   $27.9 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $26.3 million   in the same prior-year period. 
    
  Interest Expense, Net 
    
  Interest expense, net,   was   $28.3 million   (including   $1.6 million   of deferred financing costs) in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $28.9 million   (including   $1.5 million   of deferred financing costs) in the same prior-year period.   Interest expense, net,   was   $85.6 million   (including   $4.8 million   of deferred financing costs) in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $85.6 million   (including   $4.4 million   of deferred financing costs) in the same prior-year period.

Segment Results of Operations 
    
  We present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our reportable segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting. (See the  Key Performance Indicators  section of this MD A and Note 16.   Segment Information   to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
    
  Effective April 1, 2016, we changed the segments that we use to review operating results and make decisions regarding segment performance and resource allocation. Given the changes in our portfolio resulting from the Disposition and recent acquisitions, we made this change to better align our segments with our business strategy. We currently manage our operations through   three   operating segments (1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our   U.S. Media   reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in other. Our new segment reporting therefore includes   U.S. Media   and other.  
    
  The following table presents our   Revenues  , Adjusted OIBDA,   Operating income (loss)   and   Depreciation   and   Amortization   by segment, in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Historical financial information by reportable segment has been recast to reflect the changes in segment reporting with no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements. Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America (see Note 10.   Acquisitions and Dispositions  :   Dispositions   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Historical operating results for our advertising business in Latin America are included in other.

  Total   U.S. Media   segment revenue growth in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , reflects strong local revenues, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards and growth attributable to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays. In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   47%   of our   U.S. Media   segment revenues from national advertising campaigns compared to approximately   49%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Total   U.S. Media   segment revenue growth in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflects strong local revenues, an increase in average revenue per display (yield) in billboards and growth attributable to the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of billboard advertising structures in the second quarter of 2015, the loss of the New York City phone kiosk contract in the first quarter of 2015 and lower advertising revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from major sports entertainment events. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   46%   of our   U.S. Media   segment revenues from national advertising campaigns compared to approximately   47%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Other   SG A expenses decreased   $3.4 million  , or   40%  , in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $3.6 million  ), partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment.   Other   operating expenses decreased   $24.1 million  , or   29%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $22.8 million  , or   72%  ) and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment.   Other   SG A expenses decreased   $8.1 million  , or   31%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by the impact of the Disposition (a decrease of   $8.1 million  , or   72%  ), foreign currency exchange rates and lower expenses in Canada, partially offset by higher expenses related to our Sports Marketing operating segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

* 
    Calculation is not meaningful. 
       
  We continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, franchise rights, acquisitions, capital expenditures, interest and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).  
    
  In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions could be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.  
    
  Our long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total indebtedness of   $2.2 billion  .

On   October 27, 2016  , we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.34   per share on our common stock, payable on   December 30, 2016  , to stockholders of record at the close of business on   December 9, 2016  . 
    
  Debt 
    
  Long-term debt, net, consists of the following: 

(a) 
    See Note 2.   New Accounting Standards   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Term Loan 
    
  The interest rate on the term loan due in 2021 (the  Term Loan ) was   3.0%   per annum as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , a discount of   $1.1 million   on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through   Interest expense, net  , on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, we made aggregate discretionary payments of   $60.0 million   on the Term Loan. On October 31, 2016, we made an additional discretionary payment of   $10.0 million   on the Term Loan. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a discount of   $0.5 million   on   $150.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5.250%   Senior Unsecured Notes due   2022  , remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through   Interest expense, net,   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a premium of   $3.1 million   on $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024, remains unamortized. The premium is being amortized through   Interest expense, net,   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  We have a   $425.0 million   revolving credit facility, which matures in   2019   (the  Revolving Credit Facility ).  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  

44  

     Table of Contents  

The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was   $0.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $0.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , and   $1.4 million   in each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately   $31.7 million   against the Revolving Credit Facility.  
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The credit agreement dated January 31, 2014 (the  Credit Agreement ), governing the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that limit the Company s and our subsidiaries  abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company s or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC s ( Finance LLC s ) capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers.  
    
  The terms of the Credit Agreement require that, as long as any commitments remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0.   As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was   1.3   to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement.   The Credit Agreement also requires that, in connection with the incurrence of certain indebtedness, we maintain a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0.   As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was   4.8   to 1.0, as adjusted for the non-cash loss on real estate assets held for sale related to the Disposition and to give pro forma effect to acquisitions and dispositions, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in compliance with our debt covenants. 
    
  Letter of Credit Facility 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we issued letters of credit totaling approximately   $66.2 million   under our   $80.0 million   letter of credit facility. The fee under the letter of credit facility was immaterial in each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Effective October 21, 2016, we temporarily reduced our   $80.0 million   letter of credit facility by   $12.0 million   to   $68.0 million  , as we are in the process of bifurcating our letter of credit facility for administrative purposes. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had deferred   $28.5 million   in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through   Interest expense, net,   on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, letter of credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table sets forth our cash flows in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Cash provided by operating activities   increased   $24.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, principally as a result of lower upfront transit franchise payments in the first quarter of 2016 and higher net income, as adjusted for non-cash items. 
    
  Cash used for investing activities   decreased   $25.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $45.6 million   in capital expenditures, completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately   $64.7 million   and received   $90.4 million   in net proceeds from dispositions, primarily related to the Disposition. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $43.0 million   in capital expenditures, completed several acquisitions for a total purchase price of approximately   $11.1 million   and received   $8.8 million   in proceeds from dispositions. 
    
  The following table presents our capital expenditures in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Capital expenditures increased   $2.6 million  , or   6%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period, driven by installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards and an increase in digital display spending, partially offset by decreased expenditures to renovate certain office facilities. 
    
  For the full year of 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $65.0 million to $70.0 million, which will be used primarily for maintenance, growth in digital billboard displays, installation of the most current LED lighting technology to improve the quality and extend the life of our static billboards, and to renovate certain office facilities. 
    
  Cash used for financing activities   increased   $158.5 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same prior-year period. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we made discretionary payments totaling   $60.0 million   on the Term Loan. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received proceeds from debt issuances of   $103.8 million  .  
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , several marketing and multimedia rights contracts were renewed, resulting in additional guaranteed minimum annual payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , guaranteed minimum annual payments due by period were as follows: 

(a) 
    We have agreements with municipalities and transit operators which entitle us to operate advertising displays within their transit systems, including on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars and buses, as well as on benches, transit shelters, street kiosks, and transit platforms. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenues, net of agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Franchise rights are generally paid monthly, or in some cases upfront at the beginning of the year. 
              (b) 
    We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges and universities which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, including within the sports venues, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. Under most of these agreements, the school is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant revenue, net of agency commissions, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 
       
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  Our off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of operating lease arrangements and guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Note 15.   Commitments and Contingencies   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.)

For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  We are exposed to market risk related to commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, and to a limited extent, interest rates and credit risks. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We incur various operating costs that are subject to price risk caused by volatility in underlying commodity values. Commodity price risk is present in electricity costs associated with powering our digital billboard displays and lighting our traditional static billboard displays at night. 
    
  We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. However, we do enter into contracts with commodity providers to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , such contracts accounted for 3.2% of our total utility costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an active electricity purchase agreement with fixed contract rates for locations throughout Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas, which expire at various dates in July 2018.  
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities  statements of earnings and statements of financial position from functional currency to our reporting currency (the U.S. Dollar) for consolidation purposes. Any gain or loss on translation is included within comprehensive income and   Accumulated other comprehensive income   on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is their respective local currency. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $7.6 million   of unrecognized foreign currency translation losses included within   Accumulated other comprehensive income   on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
    
  Substantially all of our transactions at our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in their local functional currency, thereby reducing our risk of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. 
    
  We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk, although we may do so in the future. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we have variable-rate debt outstanding including under our Senior Credit Facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $690.0 million   variable-rate Term Loan due 2021 outstanding, which has an interest rate of   3.0%   per year. An increase or decrease of 1/8% in our interest rate on the Term Loan will change our annualized interest expense by approximately   $0.9 million  . We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk, although we may do so in the future.  

48  

     Table of Contents  

Credit Risk 
    
  In the opinion of our management, credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and advertising agencies utilized. We perform credit evaluations on our customers and agencies and believe that the allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate credit risk. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
    
  Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
    
  On an ongoing basis, we are engaged in lawsuits and governmental proceedings and respond to various investigations, inquiries, notices and claims from national, state and local governmental and other authorities (collectively,  litigation ). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in our opinion, none of our current litigation is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
    
  We have disclosed the risk factors affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued 79,690 shares of our common stock to Videri Inc. ( Videri ) in connection with licenses and services received under a development and license agreement with Videri and J M Holding Enterprises, Inc. The shares were issued without registration in reliance on the exemption afforded by Rule 506 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a transaction not involving a public offering or general solicitation to accredited investors, with adequate Company information available.

CERTIFICATION 
  I, Jeremy J. Male, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of OUTFRONT Media Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5.  
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
