NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES  

Alamogordo Financial Corp. ( AFC )
was a savings and loan holding company that owned 100% of Bank 34 (the  Bank ). On June 30, 2008, the Bank changed
its name from Alamogordo Federal Savings and Loan Association to Bank 34. Alamogordo Financial Corp. was incorporated on April
30, 1997 and was a majority-owned subsidiary of AF Mutual Holding Company. As of September 30, 2016, AF Mutual Holding Company owned
54.7% of AFC s outstanding shares of common stock. 

On March 7, 2016, the Boards of Directors
of AF Mutual Holding, AFC and the Bank unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion (the  Plan ). Effective October 11,
2016, pursuant to the Plan, AF Mutual Holding Company converted from the mutual holding company form of organization to the fully
public form.  AF Mutual Holding Company was merged into AFC, and AF Mutual Holding Company now ceases to exist.  AFC
then merged into a new Maryland corporation named Bancorp 34, Inc. ( Bancorp 34 ).  As part of the conversion,
AF Mutual Holding Company s ownership interest in the AFC was offered for sale in a public offering.  The existing publicly
held shares of the AFC, which represented the remaining ownership interest in AFC, were exchanged for new shares of common stock
of the new Maryland corporation. Because the conversion occurred after September 30, 2016, the financial information included in
this quarterly report is that of AFC. In connection with the second step conversion stock offering, cash of $27.4 million from
stock subscription deposits were received in the third quarter of 2016 and is included in savings and NOW deposits as of September
30, 2016. 

The Bank provides a variety of banking
services to individuals and businesses through its full-service branches in Alamogordo and Las Cruces, New Mexico, and Scottsdale
and Peoria, Arizona. The Bank also operates eight loan production offices in El Paso, Texas, Phoenix and Tubac, Arizona, Albuquerque,
New Mexico, Kirkland and Puyallup, Washington, Medford, Oregon, and Littleton, Colorado. The loan production offices in Kirkland
and Puyallup, Washington, Medford, Oregon, Tubac, Arizona, and Littleton, Colorado were opened in 2016. 

A large portion of the Bank s New
Mexico loans are secured by real estate in Otero and Dona Ana Counties. The economy for these counties is heavily dependent on
two U.S. Government military installations located in those counties. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of the Bank s
New Mexico loans are susceptible to changes in U.S. Government military operations in southern New Mexico. 

The primary deposit products are demand
deposits, certificates of deposit, NOW, savings and money market accounts. The primary lending products are real estate mortgage
loans and commercial loans. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions, regulation by certain federal
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by regulatory authorities. 

Rising and falling interest rate environments
can have various impacts on the Bank s net interest income, depending on the short-term interest rate gap that the Bank
maintains. The Bank s net interest income is also affected by prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of deposits. 

Basis of Presentation    The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of the financial condition and results of operations at the dates and for the periods presented. The results of operations for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full fiscal
year. This information should be read in conjunction with AFC s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. 

Basis of Consolidation    The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bancorp 34 and the Bank. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. 

Reclassifications    Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior periods financial information to conform to the current period presentation. 

7   

Use of Estimates    The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Significant estimates include, but are
not limited to, allowance for loan losses, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and related
valuation allowance, valuation of other real estate and core deposit intangibles. 

Subsequent Events    Subsequent
events have been evaluated through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. 

Summary of Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  : 

Debt Issuance
Costs -  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued  Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,
Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03) .
This update requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
the related debt and would be applied using a retrospective approach. This guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other companies, including emerging
growth companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The adoption
of ASU 2015-03 did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements. 

Business Combinations -  In September
2015, the FASB issued  ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .
ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recorded in a business combination
to reflect new information about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that, if known, would
have affected measurement or recognition of amounts initially recognized. As an alternative, the amendment requires that an acquirer
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which
the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the financial statements of the period
in which adjustments to provisional amounts are determined, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or
other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed
at the acquisition date. The new standard is effective for public companies prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. For all other companies, including
emerging growth companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the company s
financial statements. 

Leases -  In February 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . This standard requires entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance
sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The standard is effective for public
companies for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other
companies, including emerging growth companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified
retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this
authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

Credit Losses -  In June 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .
The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit
losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to create credit loss estimates.
The new guidance is effective for public companies that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filers for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public companies, the amendments are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other
companies, including emerging growth companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020,
and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified
retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this authoritative guidance on our
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2   AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES  

Available-for-sale securities have been
classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
The carrying amount of such securities and their approximate fair values were as follows: 

Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale
securities and resulting net gains and net losses were as follows: 

The last sale of available-for-sale securities
was in the third quarter of 2015. 

Amortized cost and fair value of securities
by contractual maturity as of September 30, 2016 are shown below. For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities,
which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the actual contractual maturities
of underlying collateral. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may call or prepay obligations. 

9   

The scheduled maturities of available-for-sale
securities at September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater
than 10% of stockholders  equity. 

At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, mortgage-backed securities included collateralized mortgage obligations of $8.9 million and $5.9 million,
respectively, which are backed by single-family mortgage loans. The company does not hold any securities backed by
commercial real estate loans. 

Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value
   The following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair values of securities by length of time that individual
securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position. 

At September 30, 2016, all of the government
agencies and mortgage-backed securities held by the company were issued by U.S. Government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline in fair
value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the company does not have
the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated
recovery, the company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 or December
31, 2015. 

10   

Loans and securities carried at approximately
$125.0 million at September 30, 2016 were pledged to secure FHLB advances. In addition, securities carried at approximately $4.0
million at September 30, 2016 were pledged to secure public deposits. 

NOTE 3   LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT,
NET  

The components of loans held for investment,
net in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 commercial real estate loans include construction loans of $11.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. 

11   

Allowance for Loan Losses and Recorded
Investment in Loans    The following is a summary of the allowance for loan losses and recorded investment in loans as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

12   

The following is a summary of activities
for the allowance for loan losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Nonperforming Assets    The
following tables present an aging analysis of the recorded investment of past due loans as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. Payment activity is reviewed by management on a monthly basis to determine the performance of each loan. Per company
policy, loans past due 90 days or more no longer accrue interest. 

13   

The following table sets forth nonaccrual
loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

There was no other real estate at September
30, 2016 and one commercial property at December 31, 2015, which was sold at a loss of $93,000 in June 2016. 

Credit Quality Indicators    The
following table represents the credit exposure by internally assigned grades at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This
grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements in accordance
with the loan terms. The Bank s internal credit risk grading system is based on management s experiences with similarly
graded loans. Credit risk grades are reassessed each quarter based on any recent developments potentially impacting the creditworthiness
of the borrower, as well as other external statistics and factors, which may affect the risk characteristics of the respective
loan. 

14   

The Bank s internally assigned grades are as follows: 

Pass    Strong credit with
no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. 

Special Mention    Potential
weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. Borrower and guarantor s capacity to meet all financial obligations
is marginally adequate or deteriorating. 

Substandard    Inadequately
protected by the paying capacity of the Borrower and/or collateral pledged. The borrower or guarantor is unwilling or unable to
meet loan terms or loan covenants for the foreseeable future. 

Doubtful    All the weakness
inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that those weaknesses in place make the collection or
liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loss    Considered uncollectible
or no longer a bankable asset. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recoverable value. In fact,
a certain salvage value is inherent in these loans. Nevertheless, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off a portion
or whole of a perceived asset even though partial recovery may be collected in the future. 

Impaired Loans    The following
table includes the recorded investment and unpaid principal balances, net of charge-offs for impaired loans with the associated
allowance amount, if applicable. Management determined the allocated allowance based on the present value of expected future cash
flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the
operation or liquidation of the collateral. In those cases, the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs was used
to determine the allocated allowance recorded. 

15   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, no interest income was recognized on these loans as interest collected was credited to loan principal. 

Certain loans within the company s
loan and ORE portfolios are guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA). In the event of default by the borrower, the VA can
elect to pay the guaranteed amount or take possession of the property. If the VA takes possession of the property, the company
is entitled to be reimbursed for the outstanding principal balance, accrued interest and certain other expenses. There were no
commitments from the VA to take title to foreclosed VA properties at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

16   

Troubled Debt Restructurings   
Restructured loans are considered  troubled debt restructurings  if due to the borrower s financial difficulties,
the Bank has granted a concession that they would not otherwise consider. This may include a transfer of real estate or other
assets from the borrower, a modification of loan terms, rates, or a combination of the two. All troubled debt restructurings placed
on nonaccrual status must show no less than six consecutive months of repayment performance by the borrower in accordance with
contractual terms to return to accrual status. Once a loan has been identified as a troubled debt restructuring, it will continue
to be reported as such until the loan is paid in full. 

There were no troubled debt restructurings
as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

In the normal course of business, the
company may modify a loan for a credit worthy borrower where the modified loan is not considered a troubled debt restructuring.
In these cases, the modified terms are consistent with loan terms available to credit worthy borrowers and within normal loan
pricing. The modifications to such loans are done according to existing underwriting standards which include review of historical
financial statements, including current interim information if available, an analysis of the causes of the borrower s decline
in performance, and projections intended to assess repayment ability going forward. 

NOTE 4   CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE  

The gross carrying value and accumulated
amortization of core deposit intangible is as follows: 

Amortization of core deposit intangible
was $63,048 and $80,845 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK  

In the normal course of business, the
Bank has outstanding commitments to extend credit and may have standby letters of credit, which are not included in the AFC consolidated
financial statements. The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount
of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for instruments that are included
in the consolidated balance sheets. 

17   

Financial instruments whose contract amounts
represent off-balance-sheet credit risk are as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank
evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary
by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies by and may include
accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Standby letters of credit generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing
letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank s policy
for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to
extend credit. There were no standby letters of credit at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 6   REGULATORY MATTERS  

Bank 34 is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s
financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must
meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet
items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject
to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation
to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total risk-based capital and Tier 1 capital
to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets. Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

Banks are also subject to certain restrictions
on the amount of dividends that they may declare without prior regulatory approval. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Bank was
categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized,
the Bank has to maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as disclosed in the table below.
There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Bank s prompt corrective action category.

The Bank s actual and required capital
amounts and ratios are as follows: 

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  

The following is a description of the
valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Available-for-sale Securities  
 Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
Level 1 securities include highly-liquid government bonds, mortgage products and exchange-traded equities. If quoted market prices
are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics
or discounted cash flows. Level 2 securities include certain collateralized mortgage and debt obligations and certain municipal
securities. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the
hierarchy and include certain residual municipal securities and other less liquid securities. 

19   

Loans Held for Sale    The
fair value of loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices from Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac quotes are updated daily and
represent prices at which loans are exchanged in high volumes and in a liquid market. 

Other Real Estate    Other
real estate is fair valued under Level 3 based on property appraisals less estimated disposition costs, which include both observable
and unobservable inputs, at the time of transfer and as appropriate thereafter. 

Loans Held for Investment    Loans
held for investment are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Bank records nonrecurring
adjustments to the carrying value of these loans based on fair value measurements for loans subject to impairment. The fair value
of impaired loans is typically determined using a combination of observable inputs, such as interest rates, contract terms, appraisals
of collateral supporting the loan and recent comparable sales of similar properties, and unobservable inputs such as creditworthiness,
disposition costs and underlying cash flows associated with the loan. Since the estimates of fair value utilized for loans also
involve unobservable inputs, valuations of impaired loans have been classified as Level 3. 

The following table sets forth by level,
within the fair value hierarchy, the company s assets at fair value: 

The fair values of certain of these instruments
were calculated by discounting expected cash flows, which involves significant judgments by management and uncertainties. Fair
value is the estimated amount at which financial assets or liabilities could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Because no market exists for certain of these financial instruments and because
management does not intend to sell these financial instruments, the Bank does not know whether the fair values shown represent
values at which the respective financial instruments could be sold individually or in the aggregate. 

The following tables present estimated
fair values of the company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

20   

The following methods and assumptions
were used to estimate the fair value of the additional classes of financial instruments shown: 

Cash and Due from Banks, Interest-Bearing
Deposits with Banks and Stock in Financial Institutions    The carrying amount approximates fair value. 

21   

Deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank
(FHLB) Advances    Deposits include demand deposits, savings accounts, NOW accounts and money market deposits. The carrying
amount approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed-maturity time deposits and FHLB advances is estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies the rates currently offered for deposits and advances of similar remaining maturities. 

NOTE 8   EARNINGS PER
SHARE  

Earnings Per Share    Basic
earnings per share have been calculated based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For earnings per
share computations, unallocated ESOP shares are treated like treasury shares and not considered outstanding. The calculation of
diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 excludes 18,020 shares issuable
pursuant to outstanding stock options because their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

22   

Item 2. Management s Discussion
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company.
The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and
the notes thereto, appearing in Part 1, Item 1 of this report.

Recent Developments  

On October 11,
2016, the conversion of AF Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company
form of organization was completed. Bancorp 34, Inc. became the new stock holding company for the Bank and sold 1,879,484 shares
of common stock at $10.00 per share, for gross offering proceeds of $18.8 million in its stock offering. 

Concurrent with
the completion of the offering, shares of common stock of the Company owned by the public were exchanged for shares of Bancorp
34's common stock so that the Company's stockholders own approximately the same percentage of Bancorp 34 s common stock as
they owned of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the conversion.  Stockholders of the Company received 2.0473
shares of Bancorp 34's common stock for each share of the Company's common stock they owned immediately prior to completion of
the transaction.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares was paid based on the offering price of $10.00 per share. As a result
of the offering and the exchange of shares, Bancorp 34 has 3,438,190 shares outstanding. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are those
that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income
or the carrying value of our assets. Our critical accounting policies are those related to our allowance for loan losses, the
evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, the valuation of and our ability to realize deferred tax
assets and the measurement of fair values of financial instruments. 

We qualify as an  emerging growth
company  under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may elect to use the extended transition period to delay adoption
of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private
companies, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is
irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. We have elected to use the extended transition period to
delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable
to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

23   

Allowance for Loan Losses.   The
allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance necessary to absorb credit losses inherent
in the loan portfolio. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the
loan portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires an estimate of the
loss content for each risk rating and for each impaired loan, an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,
and an estimate of the value of collateral. 

We have established a systematic method
of periodically reviewing the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish an allowance for loan losses. The allowance
for loan losses is based on our current judgments about the credit quality of individual loans and segments of the loan portfolio.
The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the probable losses
inherent in the loan portfolio, and considers all known internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the
reporting date. Our evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers
among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical
loan loss experience, our knowledge of inherent losses in the portfolio that are probable and reasonably estimable and other factors
that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance. Management believes this is a critical accounting policy
because this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions
or estimates about various matters. 

The allowance for loan losses consists
primarily of specific allocations and general allocations. Specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired.
Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the
fair value of the collateral, including adjustments for market conditions and selling expenses. The general allocation is determined
by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting and payment history. We also analyze delinquency trends, general
economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan
groups to determine the amount of the general allowance. The principal assumption used in calculating the allowance for loan losses
is the estimate of loss for each risk rating. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance we have established,
which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment .
 In estimating other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis,
to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management
considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether or not we intend to sell or expect that it is more likely than not that we
will be required to sell the investment security prior to an anticipated recovery in fair value. Once a decline in value for a
debt security is determined to be other than temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated in (a) the amount of
total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the
credit loss) and (b) the amount of other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary
impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors
is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). 

24   

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets.
  In evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers all positive and negative information,
including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management
utilizes a budget process that makes business assumptions and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
We also utilize a monthly forecasting tool to incorporate activity throughout the calendar year. These assumptions require us
to make judgments about our future taxable income that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business.
The net deferred tax asset is offset by an equal valuation allowance. Any change in estimated future taxable income may result
in a reduction of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset which would result in income tax benefit in the period. 

Fair Value Measurements . 
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date.  Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  A three-level of fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value: 

Level
                                         1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; includes
                                         certain U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government agency debt that is highly liquid and
                                         actively traded in over-the-counter markets.   

Level
                                         2   Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
                                         such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that
                                         are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
                                         market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level
                                         3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and
                                         that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 assets
                                         and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing
                                         models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments
                                         for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or
                                         estimation.   

The asset or liability s fair value
measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

Average Balance Sheets  

The following table sets forth average
balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments
have not been made for tax-exempt securities, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances.
Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying
a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted
to interest income. 

(1)  
      Yield/Rate for the three-month
    periods have been annualized.   

(2)  
      Net interest rate spread represents
    the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing
    liabilities.   

(3)  
      Net interest-earning assets represent
    total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.   

(4) 
      Net interest margin represents net
    interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.      

26   

(1)  
      Yield/Rate for the nine-month
    periods have been annualized.   

(2)  
      Net interest rate spread represents
    the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing
    liabilities.   

(3)  
      Net interest-earning assets represent
    total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.   

(4)  
      Net interest margin represents net
    interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015  

Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.5
million, or 12.7%, to $22.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $19.8 million at December 31, 2015. 

Loans held for investment increased $28.4
million, or 14.6%, to $222.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $194.0 million at December 31, 2015, due to organic growth. The
increase was specifically due to an increase in commercial real estate loans, which increased $29.7 million, or 20.3%, to $176.4
million at September 30, 2016 from $146.6 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, commercial
real estate loans increased to 79.0% of the gross loan portfolio from 75.3%, while one- to four-family residential real estate
loans decreased to 12.6% of the portfolio from 16.1%. The residential mortgage loan portfolio experienced natural run-off as the
Bank continued to focus on the secondary mortgage lending program whereby new loans are originated and sold for fee income as
opposed to being held in the portfolio. 

Loans held for sale at September 30, 2016
totaled $29.3 million, consisting entirely of residential mortgage loans. We currently sell a significant majority of our residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market. At December 31, 2015, loans held for sale totaled $11.4 million. The balances at any date
vary based upon the timing and volume of current loan originations and sales; however, the record high quarter end balance at
September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the increased loan production from the addition of four new loan production offices in
February 2016 and another in May 2016 and decreases in market interest rates in the second and third quarter. 

Available for sale securities increased
$3.3 million, or 11.5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to the investment of excess liquid funds during the
second quarter. 

Other real estate decreased $306,000 to
$0 at September 30, 2016. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 a property was added as a result of a foreclosure on a one-
to four-family residential property and sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 at a $3,000 gain. In June 2016, the
commercial real estate property held at December 31, 2015 was sold at a loss of $93,000. 

Prepaid and other assets totaled $4.7 million
at September 30, 2016 and $949,000 at December 31, 2015. The large increase was primarily the result of one SBA loan sale for $3.1
million executed in September which wasn t funded until October 2016. 

Total deposits increased $18.6 million,
or 8.2%, to $244.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $225.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase included a $36.0 million,
or 31.7% increase in savings and money market deposits, partially offset by an $12.8 million, or 17.3%, decrease in time deposits.
The $36.0 million increase in savings and money market deposits included temporary holdings of $27.4 million representing Bancorp
34 subscription offering funds on which we paid interest of 0.20% and $8.6 million of organic growth primarily from
new and existing Arizona customers. We have been growing saving and money market balances while allowing both retail and wholesale
certificates of deposit to run off at maturity to improve the deposit mix and reduce the cost of funds. 

28   

Borrowings and
Maturities  

Borrowings, consisting solely of Federal
Home Loan Bank advances, increased $36.0 million to $49.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $13.0 million at December 31, 2015.
We utilize short term borrowings to fund loans held for sale and short term cash flow needs. Loans held for sale were $29.3 million
at September 30, 2016 compared to $11.4 million at December 31, 2015. In the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we also borrowed
$10.0 million for two years at 90 basis points in a special FHLB advance auction to support portfolio loan growth and better match
the durations of those products. 

Total stockholders  equity increased
$1.3 million, or 4.5%, to $31.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $29.6 million at December 31, 2015. The growth was due to net
income for the nine-month period and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from improvement in the fair
value of available-for-sale securities. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General.   We had net income
of $584,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $128,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Interest
income increased $432,000, or 14.2%, to $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.0 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $46.4 million, or 19.0%, increase in average interest-earning
assets. The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased 19 basis points to 4.75% for the three months ended September 30,
2016 from 4.94% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest and fees on loans increased $408,000, or 13.9%, to $3.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest
income on loans increased due primarily to a $33.4 million, or 16.4%, increase in average loan balances from organic growth. The
average balance of securities increased $1.4 million, or 4.4%, to $33.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $31.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and the average yield increased from 1.33% to 1.36% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

Interest Expense   .  Interest
expense increased $84,000, or 23.3%, to $442,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $359,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partially the result of an increase in interest expense on borrowings, which increased
$54,000, or 279.0%, to $74,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $20,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Average interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $193.7 million, representing an
$11.6 million, or 6.4%, increase compared to average interest-bearing deposits of $182.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.76% compared to 0.74% for the 2015 period. 

29   

Interest paid on checking, money market
and savings accounts increased $53,000, or 29.3%, to $233,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $180,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average rate we paid on such deposit accounts increased three basis points to 0.71%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the average balance
increased $24.5 million, or 23.3%, to $129.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $105.2 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The average rates we pay on these accounts is considerably higher in the Arizona market. 

Interest on certificates of deposits decreased
$24,000, or 15.1%, to $135,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $159,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The average balance of certificates of deposit decreased $12.9 million, or 16.8%, to $64.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $76.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average rate paid on certificates
of deposit increased two basis point to 0.84% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.82% for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. 

The increase in checking, savings and
money market deposits and decrease in certificates of deposit is primarily due to temporary holdings of $27.4 million representing
Bancorp 34 subscription offering funds, maturing certificate of deposit customers preferring not to lock into term deposits, and
growth from new and existing Arizona customers. 

Net Interest Income   .
 Net interest income increased $348,000, or 13.0%, to $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.7
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a higher balance of net interest-earning assets. Our average
net interest-earning assets increased by $7.4 million, or 18.6%, to $47.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $39.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to organic growth. Our net interest rate spread
decreased by 21 basis points to 4.03% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.24% for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Our cost of borrowings increased to 0.59% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from 0.34% for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015 due to the increase in short term interest rates following the 25 basis point increase in the target Federal
Funds rate in December 2015. 

Provision for Loan Losses.   
Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb
known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. If the allowance
for loan losses is larger than necessary, we post a negative provision as a benefit to earnings. In evaluating the level of the
allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including but not limited to, charge-off
history over a relevant period, changes in management or underwriting policies, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics,
geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower and
results of internal and external loan reviews. 

See  Asset Quality - Allowance for
Loan Losses  for additional information. 

After an evaluation of these factors,
we recorded a provision for loan losses of $155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $125,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses grew $48,000,
or 2.2%, and gross loans held for investment grew $19.0 million, or 9.3%. 

To the best of our knowledge, at September
30, 2016 we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate as of September 30, 2016.  However,
future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan
portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require
us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about the recoverability of our loan balances based upon information
available to it at the time of its examination.

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest
income increased $2.3 million, or 199.1%, to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a higher volume of loan sales and related gains. There was also a $3,233 gain
on sale of other real estate in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $206,000 impairment charge on other real estate
for the comparable quarter in 2015. 

Gain on sale of loans increased $2.1 million,
or 174.7%, to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015 as the company has continued to expand its secondary mortgage loan operations. During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we sold $79.1 million of mortgage loans for a gain of $2.9 million and $3.2 million of SBA loans for a gain of $310,000,
compared to $38.1 million of mortgage loan sales and $655,000 of SBA loan sales during the three months ended September 30, 2015
for gains of $1.1 million and $62,000, respectively. We realized a 3.7% average premium (gain on sale/sold loans) on the sales
of mortgage loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Bank
has experienced higher premiums on sales of mortgage loans since mid-2015 when we enhanced our pipeline management with the addition
of more experienced personnel. Premiums vary from period to period based upon the mix of government Federal Housing Administration
(FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) loans to conventional loans, geographic markets and market interest rates, specifically
10-year U.S. Treasury rates. 

Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest
expense increased $2.1 million, or 58.8%, to $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.6 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, data processing fees, professional fees
and occupancy. The increases were primarily related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations in the fall of 2015 and
again in the first half of 2016. Average assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were 17.7% greater than for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. 

Income Tax Expense.   There
was a $27,000 provision for income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and no provision for income tax expense
recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The company has net operating loss carry-forwards from prior periods,
which offset most of the income for the September 30, 2015 period; however, we did have to pay $27,000 in alternative minimum
tax in the 2016 quarter. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General  . We had net income
of $1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $226,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Interest
income increased $1.0 million, or 11.7%, to $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $8.9 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to an 11.2% increase in average interest-earning assets and a two basis
point increase in yields due primarily to improvement in asset mix as loans, our highest yielding assets, increased from 82.6%
to 82.9% of average interest-earning assets. Interest and fees on loans increased $1.1 million, or 12.8%, to $9.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by
a $43,000 or 10.8%, decrease in interest income on available-for-sale securities. Interest income on loans increased due primarily
to a 11.7% increase in average loan balances from organic growth and a five basis point increase in average yield. The average
balance of securities decreased $3.1 million, or 9.3%, to $30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the average yield decreased three basis points. 

31   

Interest Expense   .  Interest
expense increased $142,000, or 13.4%, to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was caused by an $89,000 increase in interest on deposits and a $52,000 increase
in interest on borrowings. 

Interest expense on deposits increased
$89,000, or 8.9% to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Average interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $192.1 million, representing a $10.8
million, or 6.0%, increase compared to average interest-bearing deposits of $181.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 0.76% compared to 0.74% for the 2015 period. Interest paid on
checking, money market and savings accounts increased $154,000, or 29.8%, to $673,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 from $519,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The average rate we paid on such deposit accounts increased five
basis points to 0.73% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and
the average balance increased $21.1 million, or 20.6%, to $123.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $102.4
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in checking, savings and money market deposits is primarily
due to maturing certificate of deposit customers preferring not to lock into term deposits, and growth from new and existing Arizona
customers. The average rates we pay on these accounts is considerably higher in the Arizona market. 

Interest expense on borrowings increased
$53,000, or 114.2%, as the average rate paid on borrowings increased from 0.29% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to
0.56% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the increase in short term interest rates following the 25 basis point
increase in the target Federal Funds rate in December 2015. The average balance of borrowings increased $2.2 million, or 10.5%,
mostly due funding the increase in mortgage loans held for sale. 

Net Interest Income  .  Net
interest income increased $891,000, or 11.4%, to $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $7.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a higher balance of net interest-earning assets even though the net interest
rate spread decreased three basis points. Our average net interest-earning assets increased by $13.6 million, or 38.3%, to $49.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $35.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily
to organic growth. Our net interest rate spread decreased slightly by three basis points to 4.24% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from 4.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we carried 82.9% of our average interest-earning assets in
loans, our highest yielding asset, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 82.6% in loans for the comparable period
in 2015. This repositioning of our asset portfolio was achieved principally through organic loan growth and sales of securities
in December 2014 and early 2015, which were not completely replaced through reinvestment.   

Provision for Loan Losses.   We
recorded a provision for loan losses of $306,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $300,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, $118,000 in recoveries of previously charged-off balances were received during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $186,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses increased $306,000, or 16.2 after receiving $118,000 in recoveries. Gross loans
held for investment grew $28.4 million, or 14.6%. 

32   

See  Asset Quality - Allowance for
Loan Losses  for additional information. 

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest
income increased $4.7 million, or 146.1%, to $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to a higher volume of loan sales and related gains, and a decrease in loss
on sale and impairments of other real estate. 

Gain on sale of loans increased $4.3
million, or 132.9%, to $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 as the company has continued to expand its secondary mortgage loan operation. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we sold $188.7 million of mortgage loans for a gain of $7.0 million and $5.5 million of SBA loans for a
gain of $504,000, compared to $107.3 million of mortgage loan sales and $1.6 million of SBA loan sales during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 for gains of $3.1 million and $148,000, respectively. The average premium (gain on sale/sold loans)
for 2016 was 3.7% compared to 2.9% for 2015. The Bank has experienced higher premiums on sales of mortgage loans since
mid-2015 when we enhanced our pipeline management with the addition of more experienced personnel. Premiums vary from period
to period based upon the mix of government FHA and VA loans to conventional loans, geographic markets and market interest
rates, specifically 10-year Treasury rates. 

We incurred a $90,000 loss on sale of
other real estate in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $406,000 in impairment charges on other real estate
in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest
expense increased $4.7 million, or 44.8%, to $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $10.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits, professional fees, data processing fees,
other expense and occupancy, partially offset by lower merger-related expenses. The increase in expense resulted primarily from
the expansion of our mortgage banking program. Average assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 10.6% larger than
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Merger-related expenses related to our acquisition of Bank
1440 in 2014 decreased $100,000, or 100.0%, to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $100,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Provision for Income Taxes.   Income tax expense
was $42,000 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $42,000 income tax expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 represented payments made for alternative minimum tax liabilities. The company has net operating
loss carry-forwards from prior periods, which offset a majority of income for both periods, so no other income tax expense or income
tax benefits were recorded. 

33   

Asset Quality  

We review loans on a regular basis, and
place loans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. In addition, we place loans on
nonaccrual status when we do not expect to receive full payment of interest or principal. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time
a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the borrower
must generally demonstrate at least six consecutive months of payment performance before the loan is eligible to return to accrual
status. 

Non-Performing Loans and Non-Performing
Assets.   The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we had no troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings include loans for which either a portion of interest
or principal has been forgiven, or for loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates. 

The nonperforming loan and asset ratios
decreased due to the $617,000 decrease in nonperforming loans and the $306,000 decrease in other real estate along with increases
in both loans and assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one one- to four-family residential property was added
to other real estate and sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and a $3,000 gain on sale was recognized. In June 2016,
the commercial real estate property held at December 31, 2015 was sold at a loss of $93,000. 

Interest income that would have been recorded
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to
$57,000. We recognized no interest income on these nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

34   

At September 30, 2016, we had no loans
that were not currently classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings where known information about
possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply
with existing loan repayment terms and that could result in disclosure as non-accrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings. 

Allowance for Loan Losses.   The
allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb credit losses
inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of
the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific
impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or
the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values,
and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management s estimate of credit losses inherent
in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision
for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating
to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy
of the allowance is based on the current level of net loan losses, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and current economic
conditions. 

35   

The following table sets forth activity
in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated. 

The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming
loans ratio decreased due to the 42.9% decrease in nonperforming loans from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 compared
to the 18.7% increase in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses to total gross loans ratio decreased due
to an 18.3% increase in total gross loans compared to the 18.7% increase in the allowance for loan losses. The net recoveries
to average loans outstanding ratio decreased due to an 100.0% decrease in net recoveries. 

36   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability to meet current
and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, FHLB borrowings,
loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are
predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic
conditions and competition. 

We regularly adjust our investments in
liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning
deposits and securities, and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally
in interest-earning deposits with other banks and short- and intermediate-term securities. 

We believe that we have enough sources
of liquidity to satisfy our short-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2016. 

Our most liquid assets are cash and cash
equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any
given period. At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $22.3 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale,
which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $31.9 million at September 30, 2016. In addition, at September 30, 2016,
we had the ability to borrow an additional $75.7 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. On that date, we had $49.0
million of advances outstanding. The Bank also has two lines of credit available with other financial institutions of $6.0 million
and 2.0 million, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016, we had $33.3 million
in loan commitments outstanding, and an additional $52.7 million in commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans. In addition,
we had $9.7 million in unused lines of credit and no commitments issued under standby letters of credit. Time deposits due within
one year as of September 30, 2016 totaled $38.2 million, or 15.7% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us,
we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.
Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently
pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2017. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant
portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us, either as certificates of deposit or as other deposit products. We
have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. 

We have no material commitments or demands
that are likely to affect our liquidity other than set forth above. In the event loan demand were to increase at a pace greater
than expected, or any unforeseen demand or commitment were to occur, we would access our borrowing capacity with the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas or the other financial institutions, or increase our deposits by offering higher interest rates. 

Our primary investing activities are the
origination of loans and the purchase of securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we originated $80.4 million
of loans held for investment which included $5.1 million of sold SBA/USDA loans and $203.9 million of mortgage loans held for
sale, compared to $46.6 million of loans held for investment which includes $4.8 million of SBA loans and $110.7 million of mortgage
loans held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
purchased $8.5 million and $9.7 million of securities, respectively. We have not purchased any whole loans in recent periods. 

Financing activities consist primarily
of activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We experienced net increases of $18.5 million and $10.3 million
in total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Deposit flows are affected by the overall
level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally
manage the pricing of our deposits so that we are competitive in our market area. 

37   

Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased
$36.0 million and $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016 we have been funding
our loans held for sale with short term FHLB borrowings. At September 30, 2016 loans held for sale were $29.3 million and FHLB
borrowings were $49.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we were able to utilize proceeds from FHLB advances
and excess liquid funds held at December 31, 2014 to fund new loan originations and the purchase of $9.7 million in available-for-sale
securities. 

Bancorp 34 is a separate legal entity
from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity to pay any dividends to stockholders, to repurchase its common stock, and
for other corporate purposes. Bancorp 34 s. primary source of liquidity is dividend payments it may receive from the Bank. 

The net proceeds from the  second-step 
stock offering have significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources.  Over time, the initial level of liquidity
will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including funding loans. 
Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering, which will increase
our net interest-earning assets and net interest income.  However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds
raised in the stock offering, as well as other factors associated with the stock offering, our return on equity will be adversely
affected following the stock offering. 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital
and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk
categories. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Bank 34 exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Bank 34 is considered
 well-capitalized  under regulatory guidelines.

5.  
      The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
