    BUSINESS 
      
  Our Company 
  Mueller Water Products, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on September 22, 2005 under the name Mueller Holding Company, Inc.  It is the surviving corporation of the merger of Mueller Water Products, LLC and Mueller Water Products Co-Issuer, Inc. with and into Mueller Holding Company, Inc. on February 2, 2006, when we changed our name to Mueller Water Products, Inc.  On June 1, 2006, we completed an initial public offering of 28,750,000 shares of Series A common stock.  
  On December 14, 2006, Walter Industries, Inc., our parent company at that time,distributed to its shareholders 85,844,920 shares of our Series B common stock (the  Spin-off ).  Walter Industries subsequently changed its name to Walter Energy, Inc. ( Walter Energy ).  On January 28, 2009, each share of Series B common stock was converted into one share of Series A common stock and the Series A designation was discontinued.    
  On September 23, 2009, we completed a public offering of 37,122,000 shares of common stock. 
  On   April 1, 2012  , we sold U.S. Pipe. 
  We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of products and services used in the transmission, distribution and measurement of water in North America.  Our products and services are used by municipalities and the residential and non-residential construction industries. Certain of our products have leading positions due to their strong brand recognition and reputation for quality, service and innovation.  We believe we have one of the largest installed bases of iron gate valves and fire hydrants in the United States.  Our iron gate valve or fire hydrant products are specified for use in the largest 100 metropolitan areas in the United States.  Our large installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to long-standing relationships with the key distributors and end users of our products.  Our consolidated net sales were   $1,138.9 million   in   2016  .   
  Segment sales, operating results and additional financial data and commentary are provided in the Segment Analysis section in Part II, Item 7.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     and in   Note 15.   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA     of this annual report. 
  Mueller Co.     
  Mueller Co. manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug and ball valves, as well as dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants and a broad line of pipe repair products, such as clamps and couplings used to repair leaks.  Mueller Co. s net sales were   $715.7 million   in   2016  .  Sales of Mueller Co. products are driven principally by spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement, and by construction of new water and wastewater infrastructure, which is typically associated with construction of new residential communities.  Mueller Co. sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors.  We estimate approximately 60% of Mueller Co. s   2016   net sales were for infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement.  
  Anvil      
  Anvil manufactures and sources a broad range of products, including a variety of fittings, couplings, hangers, valves and related products for use in non-residential construction (including HVAC and fire protection applications), industrial, power and oil   gas end markets.  Anvil s net sales were   $338.3 million   in   2016  .  Anvil sells its products primarily through distributors that resell to a wide variety of end users.  Anvil services these distributors primarily through its distribution centers.  
  Mueller Technologies 
   Mueller Technologies companies offer residential and commercial water metering products and systems and water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services.  Mueller Technologies  net sales were   $84.9 million   in   2016  .  Mueller Technologies is comprised of the Mueller Systems and Echologics businesses.

Business Strategy 
  Our business strategy is to capitalize on the large, attractive and growing water infrastructure markets.  Key elements of this strategy are as follows: 
  Continue to maintain our leadership positions with our customers and end users 
  We plan to maintain our leadership positions with our customers and end users by leveraging our brands and large installed base; our valve or fire hydrant products  specification in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States; our established and extensive distribution channels; and our broad range of leading water infrastructure, flow control and piping component system products, as well as by developing and introducing additional products and services. 
  Continue to enhance operational excellence 
  We will continue to pursue superior product engineering, design and manufacturing by investing in technologically advanced manufacturing processes.  We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency.  We will also continue to evaluate outsourcing or insourcing certain products wherever doing so will lower our costs while maintaining high quality and service levels.   
  Continue to seek to develop, acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that expand our existing portfolio of businesses or that allow us to enter new markets 
  We will continue to evaluate the development and acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines that have the potential to strengthen our competitive positions, enhance or expand our existing product and service offerings, expand our technological capabilities, provide synergistic opportunities or that allow us to enter new markets.  As part of this strategy, we may pursue international opportunities, including acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships, that allow us to expand product or service offerings or to enter new markets.  We will also continue to invest, through acquisition or internal development, in technologies, intellectual capital and product development to enhance or expand our existing product and service offerings. 
   
  Description of Products and Services 
  We offer a broad line of water infrastructure, flow control and piping component system products and services primarily in the United States and Canada.  Mueller Co. sells water and gas valves and fire hydrants.  Anvil sells a broad range of pipe fittings, couplings and hangers.  Mueller Technologies companies sell water metering products and systems and leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services.  Our products are designed, manufactured and tested in compliance with industry standards, where applicable. 
  Mueller Co. 
  Mueller Co. s water distribution products are manufactured to meet or exceed American Water Works Association ( AWWA ) Standards and, where applicable, certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61 for potable water conveyance.  In addition, Underwriters Laboratory ( UL ) and FM Approvals ( FM ) have approved many of these products. These products are typically specified by a water utility for use in its system. 
  Water and Gas Valves and Related Products.      Mueller Co. manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug and ball valves, and sells these products under a variety of brand names, including Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant.  Water and gas valves and related products, generally made of iron or brass, accounted for   $504.8 million  ,   $495.7 million   and   $474.2 million   of our gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  These valve products are used to control transmission of potable water, non-potable water or gas.  Water valve products typically range in size from   inch to 36 inches in diameter.   Mueller Co. also manufactures significantly larger valves as custom order work through its Henry Pratt business unit.  Most of these valves are used in water transmission or distribution, water treatment facilities or industrial applications.   
  Mueller Co. also produces small valves, meter bars and line stopper fittings for use in gas systems, as well as machines and tools for tapping, drilling, extracting, installing and stopping-off, which are designed to work with its water and gas fittings and valves as an integrated system.

   Index to Financial Statements  

Fire Hydrants.      Mueller Co. manufactures dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants.  Sales of fire hydrants and fire hydrant parts accounted for   $184.9 million  ,   $177.4 million   and   $175.0 million   of our gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Mueller Co. sells fire hydrants for new water infrastructure development, fire protection systems and water infrastructure repair and replacement projects.   
  These fire hydrants consist of an upper barrel and nozzle section and a lower barrel and valve section that connects to a water main.  In dry-barrel hydrants, the valve connecting the barrel of the hydrant to the water main is located below ground at or below the frost line, which keeps the upper barrel dry.  Mueller Co. sells dry-barrel fire hydrants under the Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant brand names in the United States and the Canada Valve brand name in Canada.  Mueller Co. also makes wet-barrel hydrants, where the valves are located in the hydrant nozzles and the barrel contains water at all times.  Wet-barrel hydrants are made for warm weather climates, such as in California and Hawaii, and are sold under the Jones brand name.   
  Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation within their systems due to their desire to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize inventories of spare parts.  We believe Mueller Co. s large installed base of fire hydrants throughout the United States and Canada, reputation for superior quality and performance and incumbent specification positions have contributed to the leading market positions of its fire hydrants.  This large installed base also leads to recurring sales of replacement hydrants and hydrant parts. 
     Other Products and Services.   Mueller Co. also sells pipe repair products, such as clamps and couplings used to repair leaks, under the Mueller and Jones brand names. 
  Anvil 
  Anvil products include a variety of fittings, couplings, hangers, valves and related piping component system products for use in non-residential construction (including HVAC and fire protection applications), industrial, power and oil   gas end markets.  Anvil s net sales were   $338.3 million  ,   $371.1 million   and   $401.4 million   in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively, of which   $96.8 million  ,   $98.0 million   and   $98.3 million  , respectively, were of products manufactured by third parties.  The oil   gas end markets accounted for approximately   5%  ,   10%   and   20%   of Anvil s gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Anvil s sales into the oil   gas markets decreased significantly during 2015 and 2016 as a result of a decline in oil   gas drilling activity.   
  The majority of Anvil s products are not specified by an architect or an engineer, but are required to be manufactured to industry specifications, which may include material composition, tensile strength and various other requirements.  Many products carry the UL, FM or other approval rating.   
  Fittings and Couplings.    Pipe fittings and couplings join pieces of pipe together.  Anvil manufactures five primary categories of pipe fittings and couplings: 
             
    Cast Iron Fittings.    Cast iron is an economical threaded-fitting material and is the standard used in the United States for low pressure applications, such as sprinkler systems and other fire protection systems.  We believe the substantial majority of Anvil s cast iron products are used in the fire protection industry, with the remainder used in steam and other HVAC applications. 
                
    Malleable Iron Fittings and Unions  .  Malleable iron is cast iron that is heat-treated to make it stronger, allowing a thinner wall and a lighter product.  Threaded malleable iron products are used primarily to join pipe in oil   gas and industrial applications.  
                
    Grooved Fittings, Couplings and Valves.    Grooved ductile iron products, which use a threadless pipe-joining method that does not require welding, are used in all of Anvil s end markets. 
                
    Threaded Steel Pipe Couplings.    Threaded steel pipe couplings are used by plumbing and electrical end users to join pipe and conduit and by pipe mills as threaded-end protectors. 
                
    Nipples.    Pipe nipples are used to expand or compress the flow between pipes of different diameters.  Anvil s steel pipe nipple product line is a complementary product offering that is packaged with cast iron fittings for fire protection products, malleable iron fittings for industrial applications and its forged steel products for oil   gas and chemical applications.  Pipe nipples are also general plumbing items. 
     Hangers  .  Anvil manufactures a broad array of pipe hangers and supports.  Standard pipe hangers and supports are used in fire protection sprinkler systems and HVAC applications where the objective is to provide rigid support from the building structure.  Special order, or engineered, pipe supports are used in power and chemical plants to support piping systems that must withstand thermal, dynamic or seismic movement.

Other Products.    Anvil distributes other products, including forged steel pipe fittings, hammer unions, bull plugs and swage nipples used to connect pipe in oil   gas applications.  Anvil also sells pipe fabrication machines directly to customers in the fire protection industry. 
  Mueller Technologies 
  Mueller Technologies is comprised of companies that provide innovative solutions, products and services that actively diagnose, monitor and control the delivery of water. 
  Water Metering Products and Systems  .  Mueller Systems manufactures and sources a variety of water technology products under the Mueller Systems and Hersey brand names that are designed to help water providers accurately measure and control water usage.  Mueller Systems offers a complete line of residential, fire line and commercial metering solutions.  Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology.  A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display.  Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter (mechanical or static) into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems.  These remotely read, or mobile, systems are either automatic meter reading ( AMR ) systems, where equipment for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities  meters; or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure ( AMI ) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities  meters.  AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to travel through service territories to collect meter reading data.  These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals from the utilities  meters.  Mueller Systems sells both AMR and AMI systems and related products.  Mueller Systems  remote disconnect water meter enables the water flow to be stopped and started remotely via handheld devices or from a central operating facility. 
  Sales of water metering products and systems accounted for   83%  ,   88%   and   90%   of Mueller Technologies  net sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Water Leak Detection and Pipe Condition Assessment Products and Services  .  Echologics develops technologies and offers products and services under the Echologics brand name that can non-invasively (without disrupting service or introducing a foreign object into the water system) detect underground leaks and assess the condition of water mains comprised of a variety of materials.  Echologics leverages its proprietary acoustic technology to offer leak detection and condition assessment surveys.  In 2014, Echologics began offering a fixed leak detection service that allows customers to continuously monitor and detect leaks on water transmission mains.  We believe Echologics  ability to offer accurate leak detection and pipe condition assessment services non-invasively is a key competitive advantage.  
   
  Manufacturing 
  See  Item 2.  PROPERTIES  for a description of our principal manufacturing facilities.   
  We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency.   
  Mueller Co. 
  Mueller Co. operates   nine   manufacturing facilities located in the United States and China.  These manufacturing operations include foundry, machining, fabrication, assembly, testing and painting operations.  Not all facilities perform each of these operations.  Mueller Co. s existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient for anticipated near-term requirements and Mueller Co. has no current plans to expand capacity.    
  Mueller Co. foundries use lost foam and green sand casting techniques.  Mueller Co. uses the lost foam technique for fire hydrant production in its Albertville, Alabama facility and for iron gate valve production in its Chattanooga, Tennessee facility.  The lost foam technique has several advantages over the green sand technique for high-volume products, including a reduction in the number of manual finishing operations, lower scrap levels and the ability to reuse some of the materials.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
  We sell primarily to distributors.  Our distributor relationships are generally non-exclusive, but we attempt to align ourselves with key distributors in the principal markets we serve.  We believe Mueller is the most recognized brand in the U.S. water infrastructure industry. 
  Mueller Co. 
  Mueller Co. sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including municipalities, water and wastewater utilities, gas utilities, and fire protection and construction contractors.  Sales of our products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Approximately   8%  ,   9%   and   12%   of Mueller Co. s net sales were to Canadian customers in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  At September 30,   2016  , Mueller Co. had   90   sales representatives in the field and   91   inside marketing and sales professionals, as well as   113   independent manufacturer s representatives.  In addition to calling on distributors, these representatives call on municipalities, water companies and other end users to ensure the products specified for their projects are our products or comparable to our products.  Municipalities often require contractors to use the same products that have been specified by that municipality.  
  Mueller Co. s extensive installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to many long-standing relationships with the key distributors in the principal markets we serve.  Our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada.  Although we have long-standing relationships with most of our key distributors, we typically do not have long-term contracts with them, including our two largest distributors, which together accounted for approximately   35%  ,   34%   and   34%   of Mueller Co. s gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The loss of either of these distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.  
  Anvil 
  Anvil sells its products primarily to distributors who then resell the products to a wide variety of end users, including commercial contractors.  At September 30,   2016  , Anvil s sales force consisted of   117   sales and customer service representatives and   27   independent sales representatives.  Anvil ships products primarily from four regional distribution centers.  Approximately   5%  ,   6%   and   5%   of Anvil s net sales were to Canadian customers in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.   
  Anvil generally does not have long-term contracts with its distributors, although it has long-standing relationships with most of its key distributors.  Anvil s top five distributors together accounted for approximately   25%  ,   23%  , and   23%   of Anvil s gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  The loss of any one of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.  
  Mueller Technologies 
  Mueller Systems sells its water metering systems, products and services directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors.  Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services primarily to end users.  At September 30,   2016  , Mueller Technologies  companies had   37   sales representatives in the field and   2   independent manufacturer s representatives.  The Mueller Technologies businesses  five largest customers accounted for approximately   49%  ,   54%   and   56%   of segment gross sales in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.

Backlog 
  We consider backlog to represent orders placed by customers for which goods or services have yet to be delivered.  Backlog is a meaningful indicator for the Henry Pratt business unit of Mueller Co. and the Mueller Systems business unit of Mueller Technologies.  Henry Pratt manufactures valves and other parts for large projects that typically require design and build specifications.  The delivery lead time for parts used for these projects can be as long as nine months, and we expect approximately   10%   of Henry Pratt s backlog at the end of   2016   will not be shipped until beyond   2017  .  Mueller Systems manufactures or sources water meter systems that are sometimes ordered in large quantities with delivery dates over several years, and we expect approximately   30%   of Mueller Systems  backlog will not be shipped until beyond   2017  .  Backlog for Henry Pratt and Mueller Systems is presented below. 

Sales cycles for metering systems can span several years and it is common for customers to place orders throughout the contract period.  Although we believe we have a common understanding with our customer as to the total value of a contract when it is awarded, we do not recognize backlog until customer orders are received.   
   
  Competition 
  The U.S. and Canadian markets for water infrastructure, flow control and piping component system products are very competitive.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.   There are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings.  Many of our competitors are well-established companies with products that have strong brand recognition.  We consider our installed base, product quality, customer service level, brand recognition, innovation, distribution and technical support to be competitive strengths. 
  The competitive environment for most of Mueller Co. s valve and hydrant products is mature and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brand.  It is difficult to increase market share in this environment.  We believe Mueller Co. fire hydrants and valves enjoy strong competitive positions based primarily on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition.  Its principal competitors for fire hydrants and iron gate valves are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company.  The primary competitors for its brass products are The Ford Meter Box Company, Inc. and A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co.  Many brass valves are interchangeable among different manufacturers. 
  The markets for Anvil s products are highly competitive, price-sensitive and vulnerable to the increased acceptance of products produced in perceived lower-cost countries, such as China and India.  Anvil competes primarily on the basis of availability, service, price and breadth of product offerings.  Its primary competitors are Ward Manufacturing L.L.C. for cast iron and malleable iron fittings, Victaulic Company and Tyco International Ltd. for ductile grooved fittings and ERICO International Corporation, Cooper Industries plc and Carpenter       Paterson, Inc. for pipe hangers.  Historically, its mechanical and industrial customers have been slower to accept products manufactured outside the United States than its fire protection customers. 
  The markets for products and services sold by the Mueller Technologies businesses are very competitive.  Mueller Systems sells water metering products and systems in the United States.  We believe a substantial portion of this market is in the process of transitioning from manually read meters to automatically read meters, but we also expect this transition to be relatively slow and that many end users will be reluctant to adopt brands other than their historically preferred brand.  Although Mueller Systems  market position is relatively small, we believe its automatically read meters and associated technology are well positioned to gain a greater share of these markets.  Its principal competitors are Sensus, Neptune Technology Group, Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., Aclara LLC and Itron, Inc.  Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services in North America, the United Kingdom and select countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with its primary markets being the United States and Canada.  The worldwide market for leak detection and pipe condition assessment is highly fragmented with numerous competitors.  Its more significant competitors are Pure Technologies Ltd., Gutermann AG, and Syrinix Ltd.

Research and Development 
  Our primary research and development ( R D ) facilities are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee for Mueller Co., in North Kingstown, Rhode Island for Anvil and in Middleborough, Massachusetts and Toronto, Ontario for Mueller Technologies.  The primary focus of these operations is to develop new products, improve and refine existing products and obtain and assure compliance with industry approval certifications or standards (such as AWWA, UL, FM, NSF and The Public Health and Safety Company).  At September 30,   2016  , we employed   93   people dedicated to R D activities.  R D expenses were   $12.9 million  ,   $14.9 million   and   $14.4 million   during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  
   
  Regulatory and Environmental Matters 
  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, licensing, consumer protection, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others.  These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably.  For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) and similar state laws affect our operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances.  Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances.  Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that (1) we currently own, lease or operate, (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries previously owned, leased or operated, (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries sent waste materials, and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities  operations have otherwise come to be located.   The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a  potentially responsible party  ( PRP ) under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama.  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham.  Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted.  Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of EPA s remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are four other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs, if any.  For more information regarding this matter as well as others that may affect our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, see  Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS,   Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Environmental,   Item 7.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies  and Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Employees 
  At September 30,   2016  , we employed approximately   3,900   people, of whom   93%   work in the United States.  At September 30,   2016  ,   64%   of our hourly workforce was represented by collective bargaining agreements. 
  Our locations with employees covered by such agreements are presented below. 

We believe relations with our employees, including those represented by collective bargaining agreements, are good.

  Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  Our end markets are subject to risks relating to general economic cycles and conditions, which affect demand for our products and services and may adversely affect our financial results. 
  Our primary end markets are municipal water distribution and treatment systems, new water and wastewater infrastructure associated with new residential construction and the non-residential construction industry.  Sustained uncertainty about any of these end markets could cause our distributors and end use customers to delay purchasing, or determine not to purchase, our products or services.  General economic and other factors, including unemployment levels, energy costs, the state of the credit markets (including municipal bonds, mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit) and other factors beyond our control, could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
  A significant portion of our business depends on spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity. 
  A significant portion of our business depends on local, state and federal spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement.  Funds for water and wastewater infrastructure repair and replacement typically come from local taxes, water fees and water rates.  State and local governments and private water entities that do not adequately budget for capital expenditures when setting tax rates, water rates and water fees, as applicable, may be unable to pay for water infrastructure repair and replacement if they do not have access to other funding sources.  Governments and private water entities may have limited abilities to increase taxes, water fees or water rates, as applicable.  It is not unusual for water and wastewater projects to be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities and difficulties in complying with environmental and other governmental regulations.  In addition, reductions or delays in federal spending related to water or wastewater infrastructure could adversely affect state or local projects and may adversely affect our financial results. 
  Some state and local governments have placed or may place significant restrictions on the use of water by their constituents.  These types of water use restrictions may lead to reduced water revenues by private water entities, municipalities or other governmental agencies, which could similarly affect funding decisions for water-related projects. 
  Poor economic conditions may cause states, municipalities or private water entities to receive lower than anticipated revenues, which may lead to reduced or delayed funding for water infrastructure projects.  Even if favorable economic conditions exist, water infrastructure owners may choose not to address deferred infrastructure needs due to a variety of political factors or competing spending priorities. 
  Low levels of spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows.

Residential construction activity is important to our business and adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding this market could adversely affect our financial results. 
  Because a significant portion of our business depends on new water and wastewater infrastructure spending, which in turn largely depends on residential construction, our financial performance depends significantly on the stability and growth of the residential construction market.  This market depends on a variety of factors beyond our control, including household formation, consumer confidence, interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing, as well as the mix between single and multifamily construction and ultimately the extent to which new construction leads to the development of raw land.  Adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding the residential construction market could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
  Non-residential construction activity is also important to our business and adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding this market could adversely affect our financial results. 
  Non-residential construction is also important to our business.  Accordingly, our business has been significantly and adversely affected by declines in non-residential commercial construction activity due to, among other things, tight credit markets and reductions in construction spending, more generally.  Sustained uncertainty regarding non-residential development could pose a risk to us as market participants may postpone spending until conditions improve, which would adversely affect demand for some of our products.  Adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding the non-residential construction market could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
  Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales. 
  Mueller Co. and Anvil products are sold primarily to distributors and our success depends on these outside parties operating their businesses profitably and effectively.  These distributors  profitability and effectiveness can vary significantly from company to company and from region to region within the same company.  Further, our largest distributors generally also carry competing products.  We may fail to align our operations with successful distributors in any given market. 
  Distributors in our industry have experienced consolidation in recent years.  If such consolidation continues, our distributors could be acquired by other distributors who have better relationships with our competitors and pricing and profit margin pressure may intensify.  Pricing and profit margin pressure or the loss of any one of our key distributors in any market could adversely affect our operating results. 
  The Mueller Technologies companies primarily sell directly to end users.  Some of these customers represent a relatively high concentration of net sales.  Over time, expected growth in sales is expected to lessen the significance of individual customers.  In the short term, net sales could decline if existing significant customers do not continue to purchase our products or services and new customers are not obtained to replace them. 
  Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
  The U.S. and Canadian markets for water infrastructure, flow control and piping component products are very competitive.  While there are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings, many of our competitors are well-established companies with strong brand recognition.  We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including the quality, price and innovation of our products, services and service levels.  Anvil s products in particular also compete on availability and breadth of product offerings and are sold in fragmented markets with low barriers to entry.  Our ability to retain our customers in the face of competition depends on our ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
  The U.S. markets for water metering products and systems are highly competitive.  Our primary competitors benefit from strong market positions and many end users are slow to transition to new products or new brands.  Our ability to gain customers depends on our technological advancements and ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively. 
  In addition to competition from North American companies, we face the threat of competition from outside of North America.  The intensity of competition from these companies is affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against their local currencies, the cost to ship competitive products into North America and the availability of trade remedies, if any. Competition may also increase as a result of U.S. competitors shifting their operations to lower-cost countries or otherwise reducing their costs.

Our competitors may reduce the prices of their products or services, improve their quality, improve their functionality or enhance their marketing or sales activities.  Any of these potential developments could adversely affect our prices and demand for our products and services. 
  The long-term success of our newer technologies, such as smart metering and leak detection and pipe condition assessment   which are key to the Mueller Technologies businesses   depends on market acceptance and our ability to manage the risks associated with the introduction of new products and systems. 
  Our newer technologies comprise smart metering and leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services. These technologies are principally associated with our Mueller Systems and Echologics businesses, respectively.  Our investments in smart metering have primarily focused on the market for AMI and have been based on our belief that water utilities will transition over time from traditional manually-read meters to automatically-read meters.  The market for AMI is relatively new and evolving, and the U.S. markets for water meter products and systems are highly competitive. Water utilities have traditionally been slow adopters of new technology and may not adopt AMI as quickly as we expect, due, in part, to the substantial investment related to installation of AMI systems. The strong market positions of our primary competitors may also slow the adoption of our products.  Similarly, the adoption of our leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in new product and service offerings, and the pace of adoption may be slower than we expect.  If the market for AMI develops more slowly than we expect or if our new leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services fail to gain market acceptance, our opportunity to grow these businesses will be limited. 
  In addition, the success of our new products and systems will depend on our ability to manage the risks associated with their introduction, including the risk that new products and systems may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in their early stages that result in their failure to satisfy performance or reliability requirements.  Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage these risks, including costs associated with manufacturing, installation, maintenance and warranties.  These challenges can be costly and technologically challenging, and we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect they may have.  Failure to successfully manage these challenges could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to our reputation. 
  Our business strategy includes developing, acquiring and investing in companies and technologies that broaden our product portfolio or complement our existing business, which could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources and adversely affect our operating results. 
  We will continue to evaluate the development or acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhance our existing set of product and service offerings, or enter new markets.  We may be unable to identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future and completed acquisitions may not be successful. 
  Acquisitions and technology investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These types of transactions involve numerous other risks, including: 
             
    diversion of management time and attention from existing operations; 
                
    difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business or into our compliance and control programs; 
                
    working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority (our interests and other ownership interests may be inconsistent); 
                
    difficulties in obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business or technology prior to the consummation of the transaction, including the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances, including those relating to intellectual property claims, that could result in litigation or regulatory exposure; 
                
    assumptions of liabilities that exceed our assessed amounts; 
                
    verifying the financial statements and other business information of an acquired business; 
                
    inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms; 
                
    potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships or customers; 
                
    increased operating expenses related to the acquired businesses or technologies;

the failure of new technologies, products or services to gain market acceptance with acceptable profit margins; 
                
    entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or in which competitors may have stronger market positions; 
                
    dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities; and

     Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as they may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges.

  Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns.  This includes spending on capital projects, such as developing or acquiring strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhancing our existing set of product and service offerings, or entering new markets, as well as periodically returning value to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends.  To a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage key risks.  The actions taken to address specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency.  If we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value, including increased volatility in our stock price. 
  Our reliance on vendors for certain products, some of which are single-source or limited source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, reliability or cost. 
  We maintain several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships with manufacturers, including some outside of the United States.  If the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related products in desired quantities or in a timely manner.  Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could harm our operating results. 
  These relationships reduce our direct control over production.  Our reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages, and reduced control over delivery schedules of products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product costs.  In instances where we stock lower levels of product inventories, a disruption in product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs.  In addition, defective products from these manufacturers could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation. 
  A disruption in our supply chain or other factors impacting the distribution of our products could adversely affect our business. 
  A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network at any of the freight companies that deliver us components for our manufacturing operations in the United States or ship our fully-assembled products to our customers could adversely affect our business and result in lost sales or harm to our reputation.  Our supply chain is dependent on third party ocean-going container ships, rail, barge and trucking systems and, therefore, disruption in these logistics services because of weather-related problems, strikes, bankruptcies or other events could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition, negatively impacting sales, profitability and cash flows. 
  Transportation costs are relatively high for most of our products. 
  Transportation costs can be an important factor in a customer s purchasing decision.  Many of our products are big, bulky and heavy, which tend to increase transportation costs.  We also have relatively few manufacturing sites, which tends to increase transportation distances to our customers and costs.  High transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors.

Normal operations at our key manufacturing facilities may be interrupted. 
  Some of our key products, including fire hydrants and iron gate valves, are manufactured at single or few manufacturing facilities that depend on critical pieces of heavy equipment that cannot be economically moved to other locations.  We are therefore limited in our ability to shift production among locations.  The operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to: 
             
    catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, explosions, natural disasters, severe weather or other similar occurrences; 
                
    interruptions in the delivery of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs; 
                
    adverse government regulations; 
                
    equipment breakdowns or failures; 
                
    information systems failures; 
                
    violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits; 
                
    releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water; 
                
    shortages of equipment or spare parts; and 
                
    labor disputes. 
     The occurrence of any of these events may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows. 
  Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position. 
  Our business depends on our technology and expertise, which were largely developed internally and are not subject to statutory protection.  We rely on a combination of patent protection, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets protection, employee and third-party confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights.  The measures that we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not adequately deter infringement, misappropriation or independent development of our technology, and they may not prevent an unauthorized party from obtaining or using information or intellectual property that we regard as proprietary or keep others from using brand names similar to our own.  The disclosure, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position.  In addition, our actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and other resources.  We may also be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from time to time, which may result in additional expenses and diverting resources to respond to these claims.  Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired the product is more subject to competition.  Products under patent protection potentially generate significantly higher revenue and earnings than those not protected by patents.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents, our competitive position could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  If we do not successfully maintain our information and technology networks, including the security of those networks, our operations could be disrupted and unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues could result. 
  We rely on various information technology systems,some of which are controlled by outside service providers, to manage key aspects of our operations.  The proper functioning of our information technology systems is important to the successful operation of our business.  If critical information technology systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to manufacture products, process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be adversely affected. 
  We depend on the Internet and our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers.  Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  If we or our service providers are unable to prevent these breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial, reputational or other harm because of lost or misappropriated information.

We may fail to effectively manage personal data, which could harm our reputation, result in substantial additional costs and subject us to litigation. 
  As we grow our Mueller Technologies businesses, we continue to accumulate increasing volumes of customer data. In addition, we store personal information in connection with our human resources operations.  Our efforts to protect this information may be unsuccessful due to employee errors or malfeasance, technical malfunctions, the actions of third parties (such as cyber attack) or other factors.  If we are unable to protect personal data, it could be accessed or disclosed improperly, which could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.  The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. 
  We are subject to a variety of claims, investigations and litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation. 
  In the normal course of our business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, investigations by governmental agencies, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes.  Defending these lawsuits and becoming involved in these investigations may divert our management s attention, and may cause us to incur significant expenses.  In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards, penalties or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we were required to participate in a product recall or take other action to address a product liability or other claim, our reputation could be harmed.  Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.  See  Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,   Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Environmental,   Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies  and Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. Any failure to satisfy these laws and regulations may adversely affect us. 
  We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these requirements.  Failure to comply with any environmental, health or safety requirements could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes or a cessation of operations at our facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Because these laws are complex, subject to change and may be applied retroactively, we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety matters and whether they will be material. 
  In addition, certain statutes such as CERCLA may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of waste, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites.  All such PRPs (or any one of them, including us) may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site.  As a result, we may be required to conduct investigations and perform remedial activities at current and former operating and manufacturing sites where we have been, or in the future could be, named a PRP with respect to such environmental liabilities, any of which could require us to incur material costs.  The final remediation costs of these environmental sites may exceed current estimated costs, and additional sites in the future may require material remediation expenses.  If actual expenditures exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. See  Item 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,   Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Environmental,   Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies  and Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We manage our business as a decentralized organization, which presents risks. 
  We have three segments that operate under a decentralized organizational structure. Our operations have different business practices, information technology systems, accounting policies, internal controls, procedures and compliance programs. Further, we may need to modify existing programs and processes to increase efficiency and operating effectiveness and improve corporate visibility into our decentralized operations.  We also regularly update compliance programs and processes to comply with existing laws, new interpretations of existing laws and new laws and we may not implement those modifications effectively.  It could take time for any such modifications to be implemented across our operations.  During the implementation periods, our decentralized operating approach could result in inconsistent management practices and procedures, which could adversely affect our business.  Once achieved, it may also be difficult to maintain operational consistency across our organization. 
  We rely on successors to Tyco to indemnify us for certain liabilities and they may become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity. 
  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to the August 1999 sale by Tyco of our businesses to a previous owner of these businesses, we are indemnified by certain Tyco entities ( Tyco Indemnitors ) for all liabilities arising in connection with the operation of these businesses prior to their sale by Tyco, including with respect to products manufactured or sold prior to the closing of that transaction, as well as certain environmental liabilities.  These indemnities survive indefinitely and are not subject to any dollar limits.  In the past, Tyco Indemnitors have made substantial payments and assumed defense of claims in connection with these indemnification obligations.  Tyco s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites acquired after August 1999. Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures.  The result of these transactions is that the assets of, and control over, Tyco Indemnitors has changed. Should any Tyco Indemnitor become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities. 
  We may have substantial additional liability for federal income tax allegedly owed by Walter Energy. 
  We were spun-off from Walter Energy, Inc. on December 14, 2006. Under federal tax rules, each member of a consolidated group for federal income tax purposes is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for any year in which it is a member of the group at any time during such year.  In other words, each member of Walter Energy s consolidated tax group, which included us (and our subsidiaries) through the date of our spin-off from Walter Energy (i.e., December 14, 2006), is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of each other member of Walter Energy s consolidated group for any year in which it is a member of the group.  Accordingly, we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of Walter Energy s consolidated group for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. 
  A dispute currently exists with regard to federal income taxes for years 1980 to 1994 and 1999 to 2001 allegedly owed by the Walter Energy consolidated group. As described above, because we were a member of Walter Energy s consolidated group during these years, we are jointly and severally liable for any final tax determination with respect to these years, which means that in the event Walter Energy is unable to pay any amounts owed, we would be liable.  Walter Energy filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 2015.  We are monitoring the filing to determine whether we could be liable for all or a portion of any federal income tax liability resulting from this dispute if it is incurred, and not discharged, for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. See Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Our expenditures for pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted. 
  We provide pension benefits to certain current and former employees.  To determine our future payment obligations under the plans, certain rates of return on the plans  assets, growth rates of certain costs and participant longevity have been estimated. The proportion of the assets held by our U.S. pension plan invested in fixed income securities, instead of equity securities, has increased over historical levels.  This shift in asset allocation has resulted in a decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets for this plan.  Assumed discount rates, expected return on plan assets and participant longevity have significant effects on the amounts reported for the pension obligations and pension expense. 
  The funded status of our pension plans can also be influenced by regulatory requirements, which can change unexpectedly and impose higher costs if funding levels are below certain thresholds.  We may increase contributions to our pension plans to avoid or reduce these higher costs. 
  
    15 

     Table of Contents  
   Index to Financial Statements  

Significant adverse changes in credit and capital markets or changes in investments could result in discount rates or actual rates of return on plan assets being materially lower than projected and require us to increase pension contributions in future years to meet funding level requirements.  Increasing life spans for plan participants may increase the estimated benefit payments and increase the amounts reported for pension obligations, pension contributions and pension expense.  If increased funding requirements are particularly significant and sustained, our overall liquidity could be materially reduced, which could cause us, among other things, to reduce investments and capital expenditures, or restructure or refinance our debt. 
  Any failure to satisfy international trade laws and regulations or to otherwise comply with changes or other trade developments may adversely affect us. 
  Our operations require importing and exporting goods and technology between countries on a regular basis.  Thus, the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive trade laws and regulations.  Trade laws and regulations are complex, differ by country, and are enforced by a variety of government agencies.  Because we are subject to extensive trade laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities, and our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate international trade laws and regulations.  For example, certain federal legislation requires the use of American iron and steel products in certain water projects receiving certain federal appropriations.  We have incurred costs in connection with ensuring our ability to certify to these requirements, including those associated with enhancing our assembly operations and sourcing practices.  As a result of the varying legal and regulatory requirements to which our cross-border activities are subject, we may not always be in compliance with the trade laws and regulations in all respects.  Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, including denial of import or export privileges, and could harm our reputation and our business prospects. 
  Our high fixed costs may make it more difficult for us to respond to economic cycles. 
  A significant portion of our cost structure is fixed, including manufacturing overhead, capital equipment and research and development costs.  In a prolonged economic downturn, these fixed costs may cause our gross margins to erode and earnings to decline. 
  The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile. 
  Our operations require substantial amounts of purchased components and raw materials, such as scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe.  We generally purchase components and raw materials at current market prices.  The cost and availability of these materials are subject to economic forces largely beyond our control, including North American and international demand, foreign currency exchange rates, freight costs and commodity speculation. 
  We may not be able to pass on the entire cost of price increases for purchased components and raw materials to our customers or offset fully the effects of these higher costs through productivity improvements.  In particular, when purchased component or raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass cost increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which would reduce our profitability and cash flows.  In addition, if purchased components or raw materials were not available or not available on commercially reasonable terms, our sales, profitability and cash flows would be reduced.  Our competitors may secure more reliable sources of purchased components and raw materials or they may obtain these supplies on more favorable terms than we do, which could give them a cost advantage. 
  Potential international business opportunities may expose us to additional risks. 
  A part of our growth strategy depends on us expanding internationally.  Although net sales outside of the United States and Canada account for a small percentage of our total net sales, we expect to increase our level of business activity outside of the United States and Canada.  Some countries that present good business opportunities also face political and economic instability and vulnerability to infrastructure and other disruptions.  Seeking to expand our business internationally exposes us to additional risks, which include political and economic uncertainties, currency fluctuations, changes in local business conditions and national and international conflicts.  A primary risk we face in connection with our export shipments relates to our ability to collect amounts due from customers.  We also face the potential risks arising from staffing, monitoring and managing international operations, including the risk such activities may divert our resources and management time. 
  In addition, compliance with the laws and regulations of multiple international jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business.  International operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and anti-competition regulations, among others. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign

government officials and certain others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil sanctions, disrupt our business and adversely affect our brands, international expansion efforts, business and operating results. 
  Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results. 
  Sales of some of our products, including iron gate valves and fire hydrants, are seasonal, with lower sales in our first and second fiscal quarters when weather conditions throughout most of North America tend to be cold resulting in lower levels of construction activity.  This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our sales and operating results.  To satisfy demand during expected peak periods, we may incur costs associated with building inventory in off-peak periods, and our projections as to future needs may not be accurate. Because many of our expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in our profitability and profit margins and deterioration of our financial condition during periods affected by lower production or sales activity. 
  Failure to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, including key personnel, could adversely affect our business. 
  Our ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers.  The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience.  Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire.  If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in several regions of the United States where we manufacture products and particularly within our Mueller Technologies businesses.  We may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel, which could negatively impact our business. 
  In addition, our business depends on the efforts, skills, reputations and business relationships of key executive and management personnel.  The loss of any of our key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with customers and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We may be affected by new governmental legislation and regulations relating to carbon dioxide emissions. 
  Many of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide.  Federal and state courts and administrative agencies are considering the scope and scale of carbon dioxide emission regulation under various laws pertaining to the environment, energy use and development and greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, several states are considering various carbon dioxide registration and reduction programs.  The final details and scope of these various legislative, regulatory and policy measures are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on our business. 
  The potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain.  The EPA has found that global climate change could increase the severity and possibly the frequency of severe weather patterns.  Although the financial impact of these potential changes is not reasonably estimable at this time, our operations in certain locations and those of our customers and suppliers could potentially be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows.

Item 3. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     We are involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of operations, including the proceedings summarized below. 
   The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted with certainty as any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.  Other than the litigation described below, we do not believe any of our outstanding litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.  
  Environmental.    We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, both with respect to the operations at many of our properties and with respect to remediating environmental conditions that may exist at our own or other properties.  We accrue for environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that relate to past operations when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  These expenses were   $4.2 million  ,   $3.8 million   and   $1.2 million   in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  We capitalize environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of long-term assets or that reduce or prevent environmental contamination.  Capital expenditures for environmental requirements are anticipated to be approximately   $1.1 million   during   2017  .  Capitalized environmental-related expenditures were   $0.2 million  ,   $0.6 million   and   $0.1 million   in   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to the August 1999 sale by Tyco of our businesses to a previous owner of these businesses, we are indemnified by certain Tyco entities ( Tyco Indemnitors ) for all liabilities arising in connection with the operation of these businesses prior to their sale by Tyco, including with respect to products manufactured or sold prior to the closing of that transaction, as well as certain environmental liabilities.  These indemnities survive indefinitely and are not subject to any dollar limits.  In the past, Tyco Indemnitors have made substantial payments and assumed defense of claims in connection with these indemnification obligations.  Tyco s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites acquired after August 1999.  Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures.  While none of these transactions directly affects the indemnification obligations of the Tyco Indemnitors under the 1999 acquisition agreement, the result of such transactions is that the assets of, and control over, such Tyco Indemnitors has changed.  Should any of these Tyco Indemnitors become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities.  
  In September 1987, we implemented an Administrative Consent Order ( ACO ) for our Burlington, New Jersey property, which was required under the New Jersey Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (now known as the Industrial Site Recovery Act).  The ACO required soil and ground-water cleanup, and we completed, and received final approval on, the soil cleanup required by the ACO.  We retained this property following the sale of U.S. Pipe.  We expect ground-water issues as well as issues associated with the demolition of former manufacturing facilities at this site will continue and remediation by us could be required.  Long-term ground-water monitoring may also be required, but we do not know how long such monitoring would be required and do not believe monitoring or further remediation costs, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  
  On July 13, 2010, Rohcan Investments Limited, the former owner of property leased by Mueller Canada Ltd. and located in Milton, Ontario, filed suit against Mueller Canada Ltd. and its directors seeking C$10 million in damages arising from the defendants  alleged environmental contamination of the property and breach of lease.  Mueller Canada Ltd. leased the property from 1988 through 2008.  We are pursuing indemnification from a former owner for certain potential liabilities that are alleged in this lawsuit, and we have accrued for other liabilities not covered by indemnification.  On December 7, 2011, the Court denied the plaintiff s motion for summary judgment.

The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a PRP under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a proposed Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama.  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham.  Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted.  Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of EPA s remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are four other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs, if any, among the PRPs.  Accordingly, because the amount of such costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, no amounts had been accrued for this matter at   September 30, 2016  .  See  Item 1.  BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,   Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS - We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Any failure to satisfy these laws and regulations may adversely affect us,   Item 7.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies  and   Note 16.   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Walter Energy.   Each member of the Walter Energy consolidated group, which included us (including our subsidiaries) through December 14, 2006, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for any year in which it is a member of the group at any time during such year.  Accordingly, we could be liable in the event any such federal income tax liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the Walter Energy consolidated group for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. 
  Walter Energy effectively controlled all of our tax decisions for periods during which we were a member of the Walter Energy consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and certain combined, consolidated or unitary state and local income tax groups.  Under the terms of an income tax allocation agreement between us and Walter Energy, dated May 26, 2006, we generally computed our tax liability on a stand-alone basis, but Walter Energy has sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to our federal income and combined state tax returns, to file all such tax returns on our behalf and to determine the amount of our liability to (or entitlement to payment from) Walter Energy for such previous periods. 
  According to Walter Energy s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 5, 2015 ( Walter November 2015 Filing ), a dispute exists with the IRS with regard to federal income taxes for years 1980 to 1994 and 1999 to 2001 allegedly owed by the Walter Energy consolidated group, which included U.S. Pipe during these periods.  As a matter of law, we are jointly and severally liable for any final tax determination, which means we would be liable in the event Walter Energy is unable to pay any amounts owed.  According to the Walter November 2015 Filing, at September 30, 2015, Walter Energy had $33.0 million of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits on the matters subject to disposition.  In the Walter November 2015 Filing, Walter Energy stated it believed it had sufficient accruals to address any claims, including interest and penalties, and did not believe that any potential difference between any final settlements and amounts accrued would have a material effect on Walter Energy s financial position, but such potential difference could be material to its results of operations in a future reporting period. 
  Walter Energy filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 2015, which is pending before the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama ( Bankruptcy Case ).  We continue to monitor the progress of the Bankruptcy Case to determine whether we could be liable for all or a portion of this federal income tax liability if it is incurred, and not discharged, for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. 
  On January 11, 2016, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Case, alleging that Walter Energy owes amounts for prior taxable periods (specifically, 1983-1994, 2000-2002 and 2005) in an aggregate amount of $554.3 million ($229.1 million of which the IRS claims is entitled to priority status in the Bankruptcy Case).  The IRS asserts that its claim is based on an alleged settlement of Walter Energy s tax liability for the 1983-1995 taxable periods in connection with Walter Energy s prior bankruptcy proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida.  In the proof of claim, the IRS included an alternative calculation in the event the alleged settlement of the prior bankruptcy court is found to be non-binding, which provides for a claim by the IRS in an aggregate amount of $860.4 million ($535.3 million of which the IRS claims is entitled to priority status in the Bankruptcy Case). 
  According to a current report on Form 8-K filed by Walter Energy with the SEC on April 1, 2016 ( Walter April 2016 Filing ), on March 31, 2016, Walter Energy closed on the sale of substantially all of Walter Energy s Alabama assets pursuant to the provisions of Sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Walter April 2016 Filing further stated that Walter Energy would have no further material business operations after April 1, 2016 and Walter Energy was evaluating its options with respect to the wind down of its remaining assets.  The asset sale did not impact the IRS  proof

of claim filed in the Bankruptcy Case and the proof of claim, as well as the alleged tax liability thereunder, remain unresolved. 
  We cannot predict whether or to what extent we may become liable for the tax-related amounts of the Walter Energy consolidated group asserted in the IRS  proof of claim filed in the Bankruptcy Case, in part, because: (i) the amounts owed by the Walter Energy consolidated group for certain of the taxable periods from 1980 through 2006 remain unresolved; (ii) it is unclear whether Walter Energy will be obligated to pay any or all of such amounts owed; and (iii) in the event Walter Energy does not discharge all tax obligations for the consolidated group, it is unclear whether and to what extent the IRS will seek to enforce claims against us and any other member of the Walter Energy consolidated group. Walter Energy stated in the Walter November 2015 Filing that it believes its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend the claims asserted by the IRS. We also intend to vigorously assert any and all available defenses against any liability we may have as a member of the Walter Energy consolidated group. However, we cannot currently estimate our liability, if any, relating to the tax-related liabilities of Walter Energy s consolidated tax group for tax years prior to 2007, and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
  In accordance with the income tax allocation agreement entered into in connection with our spin-off from Walter Energy, Walter Energy used certain tax assets of one of our predecessors in its calendar 2006 tax return for which payment to us is required. The income tax allocation agreement only requires Walter Energy to make the payment upon realization of this tax benefit by receiving a refund or otherwise offsetting taxes due. Walter Energy owes us $11.6 million that is payable pending completion of an IRS audit of Walter Energy s 2006 tax year and the related refund of tax from that year. As a result of the Bankruptcy Case, we wrote off this receivable during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 
  Other Matters.    At September 30, 2016, Anvil was in a dispute with Victaulic Company ( Victaulic ) regarding two patents held by Victaulic, U.S. Patent 7,086,131 (the  131 Patent ) and U.S. Patent 7,712,796 (the  796 Patent  and collectively with the 131 Patent, the  U.S. Patents ), which Anvil believed were invalid.  The U.S. Patents potentially related to a coupling product currently manufactured and marketed by Anvil.  During the course of this dispute, Anvil filed multiple reexamination requests with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the  PTO ) regarding the U.S. Patents, and the PTO granted the requests.  Although the PTO examiner initially invalidated most of the claims of the 796 Patent, the PTO examiner affirmed the validity of the 796 Patent in September 2014.  In April 2015, the PTO examiner invalidated the original claim of the 131 Patent but found several claims added during reexamination that appear substantially similar to those included in the 796 Patent patentable.  The PTO examiners  decisions with respect to the U.S. Patents were appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board by Anvil and Victaulic.  In July 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board rejected as unpatentable all claims of the 131 Patent. Relatedly, at September 30, 2016, Anvil and Victaulic were also engaged in lawsuits with respect to these patent matters in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and in the Federal Court of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  In October 2016, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Victaulic, which amicably resolved all of these lawsuits and patent matters. 
  We are party to a number of other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability cases for products manufactured by us or third parties.  We provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.  Administrative costs related to these matters are expensed as incurred.  The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted with certainty as any such effect depends on future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.  While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such other litigation is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our business or prospects.

Item 7. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report. 
   
  Overview 
  Organization 
  On October 3, 2005, Walter Energy acquired all outstanding shares of capital stock representing the Mueller Co. and Anvil businesses and contributed them to its U.S. Pipe business to form the Company.  In June 2006, we completed an initial public offering of 28,750,000 shares of Series A common stock and in December 2006, Walter Energy distributed to its shareholders all of its equity interests in the Company, consisting of all of the Company s outstanding shares of Series B common stock.  On January 28, 2009, each share of Series B common stock was converted into one share of Series A common stock and the Series A designation was discontinued. 
  Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer to a particular year, we mean our fiscal year ended or ending September 30 in that particular calendar year.  
  Business 
  We expect our three primary end markets, repair and replacement of water infrastructure driven by municipal spending, new water infrastructure installation driven by residential construction and non-residential construction to grow in 2017. We expect the residential construction market to be the fastest growing, followed by municipal spending. 
  Mueller Co. 
  We estimate approximately 60% of Mueller Co. s 2016 net sales were for repair and replacement directly related to municipal water infrastructure spending, approximately 30% were related to residential construction activity and approximately 10% were related to natural gas utilities. 
  Municipal spending in 2016 was relatively strong compared with the prior year and economic forecasts predict this trend will continue.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, state and local tax receipts for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were up year-over-year and, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the trailing twelve-month average consumer price index for water and sewerage rates at   September 30, 2016   increased 3.8%.  However, water conservation efforts, particularly in areas impacted by recent drought conditions, have resulted in lower overall receipts for some U.S. water utilities. 
  The year-over-year percentage change in housing starts is a key indicator of demand for Mueller Co. s products sold in the residential construction market.  In   September 2016  , Zelman   Associates forecasted a 7% increase in housing starts for calendar 2017 compared to the prior year.  In October 2016, Blue Chip Economic Indicators forecasted an 8% increase in housing starts for calendar 2017 compared to the prior year. 
  We expect Mueller Co. s net sales percentage growth in 2017 to be in the mid-single digits.  
  Anvil 
  In 2016, approximately 90% of Anvil s net sales were generated by non-residential construction spending.  Leading indicators related to non-residential construction appear to be signaling growth in this market.  For example, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators forecasted a 2.7% increase in non-residential fixed investment in calendar 2017. 
  Sales to the oil   gas market accounted for approximately 5% of Anvil s net sales in 2016, down from 10% in 2015.  The trend in rig counts correlates with the direction of demand for Anvil s products that are sold into this market.  According to Baker Hughes Incorporated, U.S. land-based rig counts in October 2016 represented a decline of approximately 28% year-over-year.  However, as of October 31, 2016, the active rig count had increased in 16 out of the previous 18 weeks, which is a positive indicator. 
  During the fourth quarter, we announced that we will be closing Anvil's facility in Longview, Texas, which is dedicated to the manufacturing of products sold into the oil   gas market.  We will be consolidating those operations with Anvil's manufacturing facility in Houston.  This move will reduce our fixed costs in the short term and we expect to realize higher conversion margins when volumes increase.  We expect this consolidation will be completed by March 2017. 
  We expect Anvil s net sales percentage growth in 2017 to be in the mid-single digits.

Mueller Technologies 
  The municipal market is the key end market for the Mueller Technologies companies.  These businesses are project-oriented and depend on customer adoption of their technology-based products and services. We entered 2017 with a strong backlog at Mueller Systems, especially for AMI products. 
  We expect Mueller Technologies  net sales percentage growth in 2017 to be approximately15%. 
  Consolidated 
  Overall in 2017 for Mueller Water Products, we expect year-over-year net sales percentage growth in the mid-single digits with our strongest growth at Mueller Technologies.  We expect higher operating income and operating margin, driven primarily by a favorable mix of our higher-margin products at Mueller Co, but with improvement across all three segments.

Consolidated Analysis 
  Net sales for   2016   declined to   $1,138.9 million   from   $1,164.5 million   in the prior year due primarily to lower shipment volumes of $17.8 million, unfavorable currency impact of $4.9 million and lower pricing. 
  Gross profit for   2016   of   $364.3 million   increased approximately 5% compared to   $347.3 million   in the prior year.  Gross margin   increased     220   basis points to   32.0%   in   2016   from   29.8%   in the prior year primarily due to improved raw material and other costs. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) for   2016     increased   to   $218.8 million   from   $216.4 million   in the prior year and increased as a percentage of net sales to   19.2%   in   2016   from   18.6%   in the prior year.  These increases were primarily due to personnel-related costs. 
  In June 2016, our U.S. pension plan completed a pension benefit settlement program.  Lump-sum distributions to fully settle existing obligations were offered to all vested participants who are no longer working for us and not yet receiving benefits.  Approximately 75% of these participants accepted the offer.  As a result, the plan disbursed $58.5 million and we recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $16.6 million. 
  We have a tax-related receivable from Walter Energy from prior to our spin-off from Walter in December 2006.  Walter filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 2015.  As a result of this petition, we wrote off this receivable in 2015.  
  Interest expense, net   declined     $4.0 million   in   2016   compared to the prior year due primarily to the debt refinancing we completed in November 2014, which replaced the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes with the lower-rate Term Loan.  The components of interest expense, net are provided below. 

Income tax expense increased to   $33.1 million   in 2016 from   $19.8 million   in the prior year due primarily to increased pretax income.  The effective income tax rate fell to 34.1% in 2016 from 39.1% in the prior year. 
     Segment Analysis  
  Mueller Co. 
  Net sales for   2016     increased   to   $715.7 million   from   $702.2 million   in the prior year.  Net sales   increased   primarily due to higher shipment volumes of $18.8 million, but this was partially offset by unfavorable changes in Canadian currency exchange rates of $3.6 million and pricing.  Domestic shipments of valves, hydrants and brass products increased 6.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. 
  Gross profit for   2016     increased   to   $250.7 million   from   $229.1 million   in the prior year.  Gross profit for   2016     increased   primarily due to lower raw material costs, increased shipment volumes, and improved overhead absorption resulting from increased production.  Gross margin   increased   to   35.0%   for   2016   compared to   32.6%   in the prior year.  Gross margin improved primarily due to lower raw material costs, improved overhead absorption and more favorable product mix.   
  SG A in   2016     increased   to   $88.4 million   compared to   $83.8 million   in the prior year primarily due to personnel-related costs.  SG A were   12.4%   and   11.9%   of net sales for   2016   and   2015  , respectively.

In December 2014, Mueller Co. ceased operations at a foundry in Canada that primarily produced commodity municipal castings.  This resulted in a loss of   $7.2 million  , which comprised most of the total other charges of   $8.2 million   recorded in 2015. 
  Anvil  
  Net sales in   2016     decreased   to   $338.3 million   from   $371.1 million   in the prior year.  Net sales in   2016     decreased   $30.2 million due to lower shipment volumes, primarily into the oil   gas market.  Pricing and the impact of changes in Canadian currency exchange rates were each slightly unfavorable as well.  While overall shipment volumes were lower, Anvil did increase shipments of products into the fire protection market. 
  Gross profit in   2016     decreased   to   $96.4 million   from   $101.1 million   in the prior year largely due to lower shipment volumes into the oil   gas market and related unfavorable product mix.  Gross margin   increased   to   28.5%   in   2016   compared to   27.2%   in the prior year primarily due to manufacturing cost savings and lower raw material costs. 
  SG A improved to   $67.3 million   in   2016   from   $70.4 million   in the prior year primarily due to personnel-related cost savings.  SG A   increased   to   19.9%   of net sales for   2016   from   19.0%   of net sales for   2015  .  
  Mueller Technologies 
  Net sales in   2016     decreased   to   $84.9 million   from   $91.2 million   in the prior year due to $6.4 million of lower shipment volumes.  The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to the loss of a single customer's AMR purchases from   2015  , which was partially offset by increases in sales of AMI products and mobile and fixed leak detection solutions. 
  Gross profit in   2016   was essentially flat at   $17.2 million   in   2016   compared to   $17.1 million   in the prior year.  Gross margin   increased   to   20.3%   in   2016   compared to   18.8%   in the prior year due primarily to favorable product mix, particularly the partial replacement of AMR sales with higher-margin AMI sales. 
  SG A   decreased   to   $27.4 million   in   2016   compared to   $29.9 million   in the prior year.  SG A decreased primarily due to personnel-related cost savings.  SG A   decreased   to   32.3%   of net sales for   2016   from   32.8%   of net sales in the prior year.  
  Corporate 
  SG A   increased   to   $35.7 million   in   2016   from   $32.3 million   in the prior year primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses.

Consolidated Analysis 
  Net sales for 2015 declined to $1,164.5 million from $1,184.7 million in the prior year due primarily to lower shipment volumes of $16.7 million and unfavorable changes in Canadian currency exchange rates of $10.7 million offset by improved pricing of $7.2 million. 
  Gross profit for 2015 of $347.3 million was essentially flat compared to $347.9 million in the prior year.  Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 29.8% in 2015 from 29.4% in the prior year due primarily to improved sales pricing. 
  SG A for 2015 decreased to $216.9 million from $220.7 million in the prior year. SG A as a percentage of net sales was 18.6% in both 2015 and in the prior year. 
  We have a tax-related receivable from Walter Energy from prior to our spin-off from Walter in December 2006.  Walter filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 2015.  As a result of this petition, we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of $11.6 million in 2015.

Interest expense, net declined $22.0 million in 2015 compared to the prior year due primarily to the debt refinancing we completed in November 2014, which replaced the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes with the lower-rate Term Loan.  Also, debt principal outstanding declined by $45.0 million due to the November 2014 refinancing.  The components of interest expense, net are provided below.

Segment Analysis  
  Mueller Co. 
  Net sales for 2015 increased to $702.2 million from $679.1 million in the prior year.  Net sales increased primarily due to higher shipment volumes of $26.7 million and improved pricing of $4.2 million offset by unfavorable changes in Canadian currency exchange rates of $7.8 million.  Domestic shipments excluding Henry Pratt, increased approximately $13.9 million, led primarily by an increase in valve and hydrant products.  Net sales at Henry Pratt also increased by $22.4 million, led by $12.4 million shipments of plant and water treatment valves and $9.9 million of shipments from our 2014 acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by the absence of $9.4 million of prior year net sales of the Canadian municipal castings business. 
  Gross profit for 2015 increased to $229.1 million from $212.1 million in the prior year.  Gross profit for 2015 increased primarily due to increased shipment volumes.  Gross margin increased to 32.6% for 2015 compared to 31.2% in the prior year.  Gross margin improved primarily due to increased shipment volumes, more favorable product mix and improved sales pricing.   
  SG A in 2015 increased to $84.0 million compared to $83.3 million in the prior year. SG A were 12.0% and 12.3% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively.   
  During 2015, Mueller Co. ceased operations at a foundry in Canada that primarily produced commodity municipal castings.  This resulted in a loss of $7.2 million, which comprised most of the total other charges of $8.2 million recorded during the year. 
  Anvil  
  Net sales in 2015 decreased to $371.1 million from $401.4 million in the prior year.  Net sales in 2015 decreased $30.5 million due to lower shipment volumes into the oil   gas market being only slightly offset by shipment volume growth in Anvil's other markets and $2.8 million due to unfavorable changes in Canadian currency exchange rates, offset by increased pricing of $3.0 million.  
  Gross profit in 2015 decreased to $101.1 million from $112.9 million in the prior year.  Gross margin declined to 27.2% in 2015 compared to 28.1% in the prior year largely due to unfavorable product mix with the decline of shipments into the oil   gas market.

SG A stayed flat at $70.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year.  SG A increased to 19.1% of net sales for 2015 from 17.6% of net sales for 2014.  SG A in 2014 included a $2.5 million gain from the sale of certain of Anvil s Bloomington, Minnesota assets. 
  Mueller Technologies 
  Net sales in 2015 decreased to $91.2 million from $104.2 million in the prior year due to $12.9 million of lower shipment volumes.  The Mueller Technologies businesses are more project-oriented and the decrease in net sales was primarily due to fewer large projects that specified AMI metering systems. 
  Gross profit in 2015 decreased to $17.1 million from $22.9 million in the prior year.  Gross margin declined to 18.8% in 2015 compared to 22.0% in the prior year due primarily to product mix. 
  SG A increased to $29.9 million in 2015 compared to $27.2 million in the prior year.  SG A increased primarily due to additional research and development investments in Echologics and expanding the number of sales and customer service representatives.  SG A increased to 32.8% of net sales for 2015 from 26.1% of net sales in the prior year.  
  Corporate 
  SG A decreased to $32.3 million in 2015 from $39.5 million in the prior year primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses.   
   
  Financial Condition 
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $195.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $113.1 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  Cash and cash equivalents   increased   during   2016   as a result of cash provided by operating activities of   $145.1 million  , which was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of   $39.1 million  , primarily capital expenditures, and cash used in financing activities of   $23.7 million  , primarily dividend payments.  Cash and cash equivalents also decreased by   $0.4 million   during   2016   due to changes in currency exchange rates.    
  Receivables, net were   $186.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $175.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  Receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   represented approximately   56   and   51   days net sales, respectively.  
  Inventories were   $213.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $219.1 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  Inventories   decreased   during   2016   due primarily to lower raw material costs.  Estimated inventory turns in   2016   were slightly faster than in   2015  .  
  Property, plant and equipment, net was   $155.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $148.9 million   at   September 30, 2015  , and depreciation expense was   $28.3 million   in   2016   compared to   $28.7 million   in   2015  .  Capital expenditures, including external-use software development costs capitalized, were   $39.4 million   in   2016  . 
  Intangible assets were   $486.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $507.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  Finite-lived intangible assets,   $181.0 million   of net book value at   September 30, 2016  , are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  This amortization expense was   $24.3 million   during   2016   and is expected to be $20 million to $25 million for each of the next five years.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets,   $305.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , are not amortized, but tested at least annually for possible impairment.   
  Accounts payable and other current liabilities were   $179.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $161.9 million   at   September 30, 2015  .    Increased   payables relate primarily to the timing of related disbursements. 
  Net outstanding borrowings were   $485.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $489.0 million   at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Deferred income taxes were net liabilities of   $108.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to net liabilities of   $117.0 million   at   September 30, 2015  .  The   $8.2 million   decrease in the net liability was primarily related to an increased deferred tax asset related to the 2016 pension settlement.  Deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and other were   $180.8 million   and   $183.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We refinanced our debt on November 25, 2014 by repaying all of our Senior Subordinated Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes and entering into a   $500.0 million   term loan that matures on November 25, 2021.  
  We had cash and cash equivalents of   $195.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and approximately   $169 million   of additional borrowing capacity under our ABL Agreement based on   September 30, 2016   data.  Undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries in Canada and China are considered to be permanently invested outside of the United States.  At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents included   $18.6 million   and   $6.4 million   in Canada and China, respectively. 
  In 2014, we used   $10.0 million   to acquire certain assets of Lined Valve Company Inc., and in 2015 we received cash of   $0.3 million   for an adjustment to that purchase price.   
  Cash flows from operating activities are categorized below. 

Decreased disbursements, other than interest and income taxes, during   2016   reflect timing differences of purchases and disbursements.  
  Capital expenditures were   $39.4 million   during   2016   compared to   $37.5 million   during   2015  .  We estimate   2017   capital expenditures will be   $40 million   to   $44 million  .   
  We were not required to make, and we did not make, any contributions to our U.S. pension plan in   2016  .  The proportion of the assets held by our U.S. pension plan invested in fixed income securities, instead of equity securities, has increased over historical levels.  Because of this shift in the strategic asset allocation, the estimated rate of return on pension plan assets has decreased, which could ultimately cause our pension expense and our required contributions to this plan to increase.  
  Income tax payments were higher during   2016   compared to the prior year because we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income taxes during 2015.  Tax payments in 2015 were impacted by certain non-recurring expenses, primarily a $31.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, an $11.6 million loss on the receivable from Walter Energy and $9.2 million of other charges, as well as the use of our remaining U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards.  We expect effective tax rate in   2017   to increase slightly over the   2016   effective rate. 
  On April 28, 2015, we announced the authorization of a stock repurchase program for up to $50.0 million of our common stock.  The program does not commit us to any particular timing or quantity of purchases, and we may suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  In May 2015, we acquired 523,851 shares of our common stock through open market purchases.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining authorization of $45.0 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. 
  We anticipate our existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowing capacity combined with our expected operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due through September 30,   2017  .  However, our ability to make these payments will depend partly upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. 
  ABL Agreement 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the ABL Agreement consisted of a revolving credit facility for up to   $225 million   of revolving credit borrowings, swing line loans and letters of credit.  The ABL Agreement permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional   $150 million   in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability.  We may borrow up to   $25 million   through swing line loans and may have up to   $60 million   of letters of credit outstanding.   
  Borrowings under the ABL Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   125   to   150   basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL Agreement, plus a margin ranging from   25   to   50   basis points.  At   September 30, 2016  , the applicable LIBOR-based margin was   125   basis points.   
  
    32 

     Table of Contents  
   Index to Financial Statements  

The ABL Agreement terminates on   July 13, 2021  .  We pay a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity under the ABL Agreement of   25   basis points per annum.  
  The ABL Agreement is subject to mandatory prepayments if total outstanding borrowings under the ABL Agreement are greater than the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility or if we dispose of overdue accounts receivable in certain circumstances.  The borrowing base under the ABL Agreement is equal to the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable and (b) the lesser of (i) 70% of the value of eligible inventory or (ii) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of the value of eligible inventory, less certain reserves.  Prepayments can be made at any time with no penalty.   
  Substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries are borrowers under the ABL Agreement and are jointly and severally liable for any outstanding borrowings.  Our obligations under the ABL Agreement are secured by a first-priority perfected lien on all of our U.S. inventory, accounts receivable, certain cash and other supporting obligations.   
  Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of   $17.5 million   and   10%   of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL Agreement.  The ABL Agreement contains customary negative covenants and restrictions on our ability to engage in specified activities, such as: 
             
    limitations on other debt, liens, investments and guarantees; 
                
    restrictions on dividends and redemptions of our capital stock and prepayments and redemptions of debt; and  
                
    restrictions on mergers and acquisition, sales of assets and transactions with affiliates. 
     Term Loan 
  We had   $491.2 million   face value outstanding under the Term Loan at   September 30, 2016  .  Term Loan borrowings accrue interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR, subject to a floor of   0.75%  , plus   325   basis points.  We may voluntarily repay amounts borrowed under the Term Loan at any time.  The principal amount of the Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments of   $1.25 million  .  The Term Loan matures on November 25, 2021.  The Term Loan is guaranteed by substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries and secured by essentially all of our assets, although the ABL Agreement has a senior claim on certain collateral securing borrowings thereunder. 
  As described more fully in Note 6. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into interest rate swap contracts in April 2015 that hedge interest payments on $150 million of our Term Loan borrowings starting on   September 30, 2016  . 
  Our corporate credit rating and the credit rating for our debt are presented below. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt or any derivative contracts other than those described in  Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK  or synthetic leases.  Therefore, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could have arisen had we engaged in such relationships. 
  We use letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to ensure the performance of contractual obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $22.9 million   of letters of credit and   $41.0 million   of surety bonds outstanding.

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016   are presented below. 

(1)   
    The long-term debt balance at   September 30, 2016   is net of   $1.8 million   of unamortized discount on the term loan.  
               (2)   
    Excludes payment of interest associated with interest rate swap contracts. 
               (3)   
    Includes contractual obligations for purchases of raw materials and capital expenditures. 
               (4)   
    Consists of obligations for required pension contributions.  Actual payments may differ.  We have not estimated required pension contributions beyond   2017  . 
      
  Effect of Inflation 
  We experience changing price levels primarily related to purchased components and raw materials.  Mueller Co. experienced a   18%   decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel and a   23%   decrease in the average cost of brass ingot purchased in   2016   compared to   2015  .  Anvil experienced a   24%   decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel purchased in   2016   compared to   2015  .  Changes in prices for purchased parts, freight, warehousing, labor, and other factors tended to offset these changes during   2016  .  The Mueller Technologies businesses are not significantly impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices. 
   
  Seasonality  
  Our water infrastructure business depends on construction activity, which is seasonal in many areas due to the impact of cold weather conditions on construction.  Net sales and operating income have historically been lowest in the quarters ending December 31 and March 31 when the northern United States and all of Canada generally face weather conditions that restrict significant construction and other field crew activity.  For Mueller Co., approximately   45%   of a fiscal year s net sales occurs in the first half of the fiscal year with   55%   occurring in the second half of the fiscal year.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Seasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results.    
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  These estimates are based upon experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur over time or the use of reasonably different estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  We consider the accounting topics presented below to include our critical accounting estimates. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We recognize revenue when delivery of a product or performance of a service has occurred and there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement, sales prices are fixed and determinable and collectability from the customers is reasonably assured.  Sales are recorded net of estimated discounts, returns and rebates.  Discounts, returns and rebates are estimated based upon current offered sales terms and historical return and allowance rates.

     Table of Contents  
   Index to Financial Statements  

Receivables 
  The estimated allowance for doubtful receivables is based upon judgments and estimates of expected losses and specific identification of problem accounts.  Significantly weaker than anticipated industry or economic conditions could impact customers  ability to pay such that actual losses may be greater than the amounts provided for in this allowance.  The periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful receivables is based on an analysis of prior collection experience, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries served.  In circumstances where a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation is known to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings), we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. 
  Inventories 
  We record inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out method cost or estimated net realizable value.  Inventory cost includes an overhead component that can be affected by levels of production and actual costs incurred.  We evaluate the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly.  This evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage, inventory levels and ultimate product sales value.  Inventory that, in the judgment of management, is obsolete or in excess of our normal usage is written-down to its estimated market value, if less than its cost.  Significant judgments must be made when establishing the allowance for obsolete and excess inventory. 
  Income Taxes 
  We recognize deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Our tax balances are based on our expectations of future operating performance, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, interpretation of the tax regulations currently enacted and rulings in numerous tax jurisdictions.   
  We only record tax benefits for positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under audit examination based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position.  The amount of tax benefit recognized for any position that meets the more likely than not threshold is the largest amount of the tax benefit that we believe is greater than 50% likely of being realized. 
  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment).  We performed this annual impairment testing at September 1, and concluded that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.  We tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a  royalty savings method,  which is a variation of the discounted cash flow method.  This method estimates a fair value by calculating an estimated discounted future cash flow stream from the hypothetical licensing of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.  If this estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.  This analysis is dependent on management s best estimates of future operating results and the selection of reasonable discount rates and hypothetical royalty rates.  Significantly different projected operating results could result in a different conclusion regarding impairment.  Standard valuation methodologies using rates considered reasonable by management have not indicated an impairment. 
   Other long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment.

Contingencies 
  We are involved in litigation, investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business.  We estimate and accrue liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors, including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements; assessments by counsel of pending or threatened litigation; and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs.  We believe we have adequately accrued for these potential liabilities; however, facts and circumstances may change and could cause the actual liability to exceed the estimates, or may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future.  As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.  Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.  Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.  For more information on these and other contingencies, see   Note 16.   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  See also  Item 1.  BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,   Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS  and  Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
  Workers Compensation, Defined Benefit Pension Plans, Environmental and Other Long-term Liabilities 
  We are obligated for various liabilities that will ultimately be determined over what could be a very long future time period.  We established the recorded liabilities for such items at September 30,   2016   using estimates for when such amounts will be paid and what the amounts of such payments will be.  These estimates are subject to change based on numerous factors, including among others, regulatory changes, technology changes, the investment performance of related assets, longevity of participants, the discount rate used and changes to plan designs. 
   
           Item 7A. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     We are exposed to various market risks, including potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, such as various commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.  We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Our primary financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents.  This includes cash in banks and highly rated, liquid money market investments.  We believe those instruments are not subject to material potential near-term losses in future earnings from reasonably possible near-term changes in market rates or prices. 
  Commodity Price Risk  
  Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, including scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe.  We expect prices for these items to fluctuate based on marketplace demand and our product margins and level of profitability may fluctuate if we do not pass changes in purchased component and raw material costs on to our customers. 
    Mueller Co. experienced a   18%   decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel and a   23%   decrease in the average cost of brass ingot purchased in   2016   compared to   2015  .  Anvil experienced a   24%   decrease in the average cost per ton of scrap steel purchased in   2016   compared to   2015  .  Changes in prices for purchased parts, freight, warehousing, labor, and other factors tended to offset these changes during 2016.  See  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-The prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile.    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have variable rate debt with a face value of   $491.2 million  . To the extent LIBOR is above our Term Loan s rate floor of 0.75%, the impact on pre-tax earnings or cash flows resulting from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt, holding other variables constant, would be approximately   $5 million   per year.  Our interest rate swap contracts described more fully in Note 7. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reduce this annual hypothetical exposure by approximately   $1.5 million   during 2017-2021.

Currency Risk  
  Our principal assets, liabilities and operations outside the U.S. are in Canada, China and Australia.  These assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at currency exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, with the effect of such translation reflected in other comprehensive loss.  Our stockholders  equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these non-U.S. currencies.  Net sales and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average currency exchange rate during the period.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $52.8 million   of our net assets were denominated in non-U.S. currencies.

     The Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are filed as part of this annual report are listed under  Item 15. EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES  and are set forth beginning on page F-1 .  
  Selected quarterly financial data for   2016   and   2015   are provided in   Note 18.   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
           Item 9A. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Based on this evaluation, those officers have concluded that, at   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act).  Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at   September 30, 2016  .  In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   (2013 framework).  After doing so, management concluded that, at   September 30, 2016  , our internal control over financial reporting was effective.  
   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at   September 30, 2016   has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this annual report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mueller Water Products, Inc. 
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30,   2016   and   2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,   2016  .  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30,   2016   and   2015  , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,   2016  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Mueller Water Products, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,   2016  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control-Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated   November 22, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mueller Water Products, Inc. 
  We have audited Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  , based on criteria established in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)(the COSO criteria).  Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  In our opinion, Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  , based on the COSO criteria. 
  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mueller Water Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended   September 30, 2016   and our report dated   November 22, 2016   expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

MUELLER WATER PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,   2016    
   
           Note 1. 
    Organization    
     Mueller Water Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, operates in   three   business segments:  Mueller Co., Anvil and Mueller Technologies.  Mueller Co. manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including butterfly, iron gate, tapping, check, knife, plug and ball valves, as well as dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants.  Anvil manufactures and sources a broad range of products, including a variety of fittings, couplings, hangers and related products.  Mueller Technologies offers metering systems, leak detection, pipe condition assessment and other products and services for the water infrastructure industry.  The  Company,   we,   us  or  our  refer to Mueller Water Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  With regard to the Company s segments,  we,   us  or  our  may also refer to the segment being discussed. 
  In   July 2014  , Mueller Co. acquired a   49%   ownership in an industrial valve joint-venture for   $1.7 million  .   Due to substantive control features in the joint-venture agreement, all of the joint venture s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements.  We included an adjustment for the loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Noncontrolling interest is recorded at its carrying value, which approximates fair value.  
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation. 
  Unless the context indicates otherwise, whenever we refer to a particular year, we mean our fiscal year ended or ending September 30 in that particular calendar year.   
   
           Note 2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
     Revenue Recognition  -Revenue is recognized when delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered and there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement, selling prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Revenue is reported net of estimated discounts, returns and rebates as  net sales.  
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance for the recognition of revenue.  This new guidance applies to us beginning with our first quarter of 2019 and we do not anticipate adopting early.  We are in the early stages of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures and we have not yet reached any conclusions. 
  Stock-based Compensation-  Compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to employees and directors is based on the fair value at the grant dates for our outstanding stock-settled share awards and is based on the fair value at each reporting date for our cash-settled share awards.    See Note 10.   for more information regarding our stock-based compensation.  Stock-based compensation expense is a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.   
  At March 31, 2016, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-09   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    Most significantly, this update changes the accounting for  excess tax benefits  related to stock-based compensation awards by requiring such benefits be included in earnings, rather than recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents-  All highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.  Where there is no right of offset against cash balances, outstanding checks are included in accounts payable. 
  Receivables-  Receivables are amounts due from customers.  To reduce credit risk, credit investigations are generally performed prior to accepting orders from new customers and, when necessary, letters of credit, bonds or other instruments are required to ensure payment.

     Table of Contents  
   Index to Financial Statements  

The allowance for doubtful receivables is based upon judgments and estimates of expected losses and specific identification of problem accounts.  Significantly weaker than anticipated industry or economic conditions could impact customers  ability to pay such that actual losses may be greater than the amounts provided for in this allowance.  The periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful receivables is based on an analysis of prior collection experience, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries served.  In circumstances where we expect a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings), we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected. 
  The following table summarizes information concerning our allowance for doubtful receivables. 

Inventories-  Inventories are recorded at the lower of first-in, first-out method cost or estimated net realizable value.  We evaluate our inventory in terms of excess and obsolete exposures.  This evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage, inventory turnover, inventory levels and ultimate product sales value.  Inventory cost includes an overhead component that is affected by levels of production and actual costs incurred.  Management periodically evaluates the effects of production levels and costs capitalized as part of inventory. 
  The following table summarizes information concerning our inventory valuation reserves. 

Other Current Assets-  Other current assets include maintenance supplies and tooling costs.  Costs for perishable tools and maintenance items are expensed when put into service.  Costs for more durable items are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from   3   to   10   years.  
  Property, Plant and Equipment-  Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Estimated useful lives are   10   to   20   years for land improvements,   10   to   40   years for buildings and   3   to   15   years for machinery and equipment.  Leasehold improvements and capitalized leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term.  Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in operating results in the period of disposition. 
  Direct internal and external costs to implement computer systems and internal-use software are capitalized.  Capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the system or software, generally   3   to   6   years, beginning when site installation or module development is complete and ready for use. 
  Liabilities are recognized at fair value for asset retirement obligations related to plant and landfill closures in the period in which they are incurred and the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets are correspondingly increased.  Over time, the liabilities are accreted to their estimated future values.    At September 30, 2016   and   2015  , asset retirement obligations were   $7.5 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02   Leases  , which will require us to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases currently referred to as operating leases.  This requirement is effective for 2020, although early adoption is permitted.  The update allows for several different methods of application and adoption of the requirement.  We are currently evaluating these methods, in what period we will adopt the requirement, and the impact of this requirement, which we do not believe will be material to our consolidated financial statements as a whole.  
  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets-  We test indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment.)  We perform our annual impairment testing at September 1.  We amortize finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives and review for impairment if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment.    
  Workers Compensation-  Our exposure to workers compensation claims is generally limited to   $1 million   per incident.  Liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments and using historical data combined with insurance industry data when historical data is limited.  We are indemnified under an agreement with a predecessor to Tyco for all Mueller Co. and Anvil workers compensation liabilities related to incidents that occurred prior to August 16, 1999.    See Note 16.    We retained U.S. Pipe workers compensation liabilities related to incidents that occurred prior to the segment's April 1, 2012 sale date , but the purchaser agreed to reimburse us for up to   $11.8 million   in payments we make related to these liabilities.  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining reimbursements may be up to   $4.9 million  , which we have recorded on a discounted basis as   $0.6 million   in other current assets and   $4.1 million   in other noncurrent assets.  On an undiscounted basis, workers compensation liabilities were   $13.7 million   and   $15.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  On a discounted basis, workers compensation liabilities were   $11.8 million   and   $13.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  We apply a discount rate at a risk-free interest rate, generally a U.S. Treasury bill rate, for each policy period.  The rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy period.  Once a discount rate is applied to a policy period, it remains the discount rate for that policy period until all claims are paid.   
  Warranty Costs-  We accrue for warranty expenses that can include customer costs of repair and/or replacement, including labor, materials, equipment, freight and reasonable overhead costs.  We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale if such costs are determined to be reasonably estimable at that time.  Warranty cost estimates are revised throughout applicable warranty periods as better information regarding warranty costs becomes available.   
  Activity in accrued warranty, reported as part of other current liabilities, is presented below. 

Deferred Financing Costs-  Costs of debt financing are charged to expense over the lives of the related financing agreements.  Remaining costs and the future period over which they would be charged to expense are reassessed when amendments to the related financing agreements or prepayments occur. 
  ABL Agreement-related deferred financing costs are included in other noncurrent assets and remaining deferred financing costs are offset against long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Deferred financing costs of   $8.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   are scheduled to amortize as follows:   $1.8 million   related to the ABL Agreement amortizes on a straight-line basis;   $6.3 million   related to the Term Loan amortizes using the effective-interest rate method.  All such amortization will be over the remaining term of the respective debt.  See   Note 6. 
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-  We manage interest rate risk to some extent using derivative instruments. We designated our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges of interest payments.  As a result, the changes in the fair value of these contracts prior to settlement are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.

Income Taxes-  Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Such liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
  We only record tax benefits for positions that management believes are more likely than not of being sustained under audit based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position.  The amount of tax benefit recognized for any position that meets the more likely than not threshold is the largest amount of the tax benefit that we believe is greater than   50%   likely of being realized. 
  At December 31, 2015, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires that all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, netted by tax jurisdiction, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.  The prior period consolidated balance sheet has not been reclassified.  
  Environmental Expenditures-  We capitalize environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of noncurrent assets or that reduce or prevent environmental contamination.  We accrue for environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that relate to past operations when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  We are indemnified under an agreement with a predecessor to Tyco for certain environmental liabilities that existed at August 16, 1999.    See Note 16. 
  Research and Development-  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
  Advertising-  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  
  Translation of Foreign Currency-  Assets     and liabilities of our businesses whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at average currency exchange rates during the period.  Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in operating results as incurred. 
   
           Note 3. 
    Intangible Assets    
     Direct internal and external costs to develop external-use software are capitalized.  Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, beginning when the software is complete and ready for sale.  During 2014, we revised our estimate of the useful life of the software to   6   years from   3   years.  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining weighted-average amortization period for external-use software was   3.6   years.  Amortization expense related to such software assets was   $1.9 million  ,   $1.6 million   and   $1.1 million   for   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Amortization expense for each of the next five years is scheduled to be   $2.8 million   in   2017  ,   $2.6 million   in   2018  ,   $2.4 million   in   2019  ,   $2.1 million   in   2020   and   $1.3 million   in   2021  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining weighted-average amortization period for the business combination-related finite-lived intangible assets was   7.2   years.  Amortization expense related to these assets was   $22.4 million  ,   $27.8 million   and   $28.3 million   for   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Amortization expense for each of the next five years is scheduled to be   $22.3 million   in   2017  ,   $22.5 million   in   2018  ,   $22.3 million   in   2019  ,   $22.2 million   in   2020   and   $21.9 million   in   2021  .

    Other Charges    
     During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we initiated certain demolition and related activities for our Statesboro, Georgia property, some of the costs of which are indemnified by Tyco as explained in   Note 16.    We have recorded a receivable from Tyco for our estimated recovery under the indemnification and a net charge of   $4.1 million   under the caption other charges for our Corporate segment through September 30, 2016. 
  In 2015, Mueller Co. sold certain assets related to its municipal casting operations in Canada and closed the associated facility.  These actions resulted in restructuring expense of   $7.2 million   under the caption other charges, which was comprised of a   $2.5 million   impairment charge,   $2.3 million   of environmental remediation costs and   $2.4 million   of severance and other costs.  These operations generated net sales of   $11.5 million   during 2014. 
  In 2014, Anvil sold the production equipment and certain inventory at its Bloomington, Minnesota location for an immaterial gain.  Anvil also signed a supply agreement with the buyer and terminated the employment of all employees at that location, which resulted in the withdrawal from the only multi-employer pension plan in which the Company had participated.  Anvil recorded a related withdrawal liability of   $0.9 million   as restructuring expense under the caption other charges.  Also in 2014, Anvil sold the land and buildings at this location, which resulted in a net a gain of   $2.5 million   included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested, and thus for which United States income taxes have not been provided, was   $54.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  It is not currently practical to estimate the amount of unrecognized United States income taxes that might be payable on the repatriation of these earnings.

Deferred income tax balances are presented below. 

We reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets each quarter, considering results to date, projections of taxable income, tax planning strategies and reversing taxable temporary differences.   
  After inclusion of the tax effect of the loss on the sale of U.S. Pipe in 2012, our net reversing deferred tax credits were insufficient to fully support our deferred tax assets, which included net operating loss carryforwards, and we concluded that a valuation allowance was necessary to reduce our U.S. net reversing deferred tax assets to zero.  Accordingly, we recorded income tax expense in 2012 to establish valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the 2014 fourth quarter, we credited to income substantially all of the deferred tax valuation allowance based on our expectation of future taxable income.  In the 2015 fourth quarter, we credited to income the remaining state net operating loss valuation allowance based on utilization. 
  Our state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between calendar years   2016   and   2033  , remain available to offset future taxable earnings.  
  The following table summarizes information concerning our gross unrecognized tax benefits. 

Substantially all unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the effective tax rate.  We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and recognize any penalties incurred as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, of accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits. 
  We expect to settle certain state income tax audits within the next 12 months and believe it is reasonably possible that these audit settlements will reduce the gross unrecognized tax benefits by   $0.8 million  .

The federal income tax returns for Mueller Co. and Anvil are closed for years prior to 2005 and for Mueller Water Products, Inc. for 2007 and 2008.  Our 2009 through 2012 returns are closed except to the extent net operating losses from those years have been utilized on subsequent years  returns.  Tax years 1980 to 1994 and 1999 to 2001 remain open for our predecessor company, U.S. Pipe, which was a subsidiary of Walter Energy in those years.    See Note 16.    We also remain liable for any taxes related to periods prior to the sale of U.S. Pipe in 2012 pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement with the purchaser of the segment. 
  Our state income tax returns are generally closed for years prior to 2012, except to the extent of our state net operating loss carryforwards.  Our Canadian income tax returns are generally closed for years prior to 2009.  We are currently under audit by several jurisdictions, including Canada Revenue Agency for the year ended September 30, 2014, at various levels of completion.  We do   not   have any material unpaid assessments. 
   
           Note 6. 
    Borrowing Arrangements 
     The components of our long-term debt are presented below. 

ABL Agreement  . Our asset based lending agreement ( ABL Agreement ) consists of a revolving credit facility for up to   $225 million   of revolving credit borrowings, swing line loans and letters of credit.  The ABL Agreement also permits us to increase the size of the credit facility by an additional   $150 million   in certain circumstances subject to adequate borrowing base availability.  We may borrow up to   $25 million   through swing line loans and may have up to   $60 million   of letters of credit outstanding. 
  Borrowings under the ABL Agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   125   to   150   basis points, or a base rate, as defined in the ABL Agreement, plus a margin ranging from   25   to   50   basis points.  At   September 30, 2016   the applicable rate was LIBOR plus   125   basis points. 
  The ABL Agreement terminates on   July 13, 2021  .  We pay a commitment fee for any unused borrowing capacity under the ABL Agreement of   25   basis points per annum.  Borrowings are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants unless excess availability is less than the greater of   $17.5 million   and   10%   of the Loan Cap as defined in the ABL Agreement.  Excess availability based on   September 30, 2016   data, as reduced by outstanding letters of credit, swap contract liabilities and accrued fees and expenses of   $30.4 million  , was approximately   $169 million  . 
  Term Loan  .  On   November 25, 2014  , we entered into a   $500.0 million   senior secured term loan ( Term Loan ).  We capitalized   $8.5 million   of financing costs, which are being amortized over the term of the Term Loan using the effective interest rate method.  The proceeds from the Term Loan, along with other cash, were used to prepay our 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes ( Senior Subordinated Notes ) and 8.75% Senior Unsecured Notes ( Senior Unsecured Notes ) and to satisfy and discharge our obligations under the respective indentures.  We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $31.3 million  , which consisted of   $25.2 million   of tender and call premiums,   $4.4 million   of deferred financing costs and   $1.7 million   of unamortized discount written off.   
  The Term Loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR, subject to a floor of   0.75%  , plus   325   basis points.  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average effective interest rate, including amortization of deferred finance costs and original issue discount and the effect of interest rate swaps, was   4.54%  .  We may voluntarily repay amounts borrowed under the Term Loan at any time.  The principal amount of the Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments of   $1.25 million  , with any remaining principal due on   November 25, 2021  .  The Term Loan is guaranteed by substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries and is secured by essentially all of our assets, although the ABL Agreement has a senior claim on certain collateral securing borrowings thereunder.  The Term Loan is reported net of unamortized discount of   $1.8 million  .  Based on quoted market prices, the outstanding Term Loan had a fair value of   $496.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  .

The Term Loan contains affirmative and negative operating covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries. We believe we were compliant with these covenants at   September 30, 2016   and expect to remain in compliance through   September 30,      2017  . 
  The scheduled maturities of all borrowings outstanding at   September 30, 2016   for each of the following years are   $5.9 million   for   2017  ,   $5.6 million   for   2018  ,   $5.4 million   for   2019  ,   $5.1 million   for   2020  ,   $5.0 million   for   2021   and   $466.2 million   after   2021  .   
   
           Note 7. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments    
     We are exposed to interest rate risk that we manage to some extent using derivative instruments.  Under our   April 2015   interest rate swap contracts, we receive interest calculated using 3-month LIBOR, subject to a floor of   0.750%  , and pay fixed interest at   2.341%  , on an aggregate notional amount of   $150.0 million  .  These swap contracts effectively fix the cash interest rate on   $150.0 million   of our borrowings under the Term Loan at   5.591%   from   September 30, 2016   through   September 30, 2021  . 
  We have designated our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges of our future interest payments and elected to apply the  shortcut  method of assessing hedge effectiveness.  As a result, the gains and losses on the swap contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive loss and are reclassified into interest expense as the related interest payments are made.  
  The fair values of the swap contracts are presented below. 

The fair values and the classification of the fair values between current and noncurrent portions are based on calculated cash flows using publicly available interest rate forward rate yield curve information, but amounts due at the actual settlement dates are dependent on actual rates in effect at the settlement dates and may differ significantly from amounts shown above. 
   
           Note. 8 
    Retirement Plans    
     We have various pension plans ( Pension Plans ), which we fund in accordance with their requirements and, where applicable, in amounts sufficient to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of applicable laws.  The Pension Plans provide benefits based on years of service and compensation or at stated amounts for each year of service. 
  The measurement date for all Pension Plans was September 30. 
  During 2016, our U.S. pension plan ( Plan ) completed a pension obligation settlement program targeting vested, terminated participants not yet receiving benefits.  Approximately   75%   of eligible participants accepted settlement offers.  The Plan distributed assets totaling   $58.5 million  .  We incurred a non-cash pension settlement charge of   $16.6 million   as a result of the program, which had an immaterial impact on the Plan s funded ratio. 
  During 2015, we contributed   $1.2 million   to fully fund two of our Canadian plans and recorded a pension settlement charge of   $0.5 million  .  
  We were not required to make, and we did not make, any contributions to our U.S. pension plan in   2016  , and we currently plan to make   $1.3 million   of contributions to a Canadian pension plan in   2017  . 
  Our U.S. plan comprised   98%   of the Pension Plans  obligations and   98%   of the Pension Plans  assets at   September 30, 2016  .

Amounts recognized for our Pension Plans and other postretirement benefit plans are presented below. 

The discount rates for determining the present value of pension obligations were selected using a  bond settlement  approach, which constructs a hypothetical bond portfolio that could be purchased such that the coupon payments and maturity values could be used to satisfy the projected benefit payments.  The discount rate is the equivalent rate that results in the present value of the projected benefit payments equaling the market value of this bond portfolio. Only high quality (AA graded or higher), non-callable corporate bonds are included in this bond portfolio.  We rely on the Pension Plans  actuaries to assist in the development of the discount rate model.  The actuarial loss in 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015.  The actuarial gain in 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2014. 
  Management s expected returns on plan assets were determined with the assistance of the Pension Plans  actuaries and investment consultants.  Expected returns on plan assets were developed using forward looking returns over a time horizon of   10   to   15   years for major asset classes along with projected risk and historical correlations.

A summary of key assumptions for our pension plans is below. 

We maintain a single trust to hold the assets of the U.S. pension plan.  Throughout 2014, 2015, and most of 2016, the strategic asset allocation was about   40%   equity investments.  Near the end of 2016, we directed our investment manager to adjust the asset allocation to about   30%   equity investments.  This trust s strategic asset allocations, tactical range at   September 30, 2016   and actual asset allocations are presented below.   

Assets of the Pension Plans are allocated to various investments to attain diversification and reasonable risk-adjusted returns while also managing the exposure to asset and liability volatility.  These ranges are targets and deviations may occur from time to time due to market fluctuations.  Portfolio assets are typically rebalanced to the allocation targets at least annually.

The valuation methodologies used to measure the assets of the Pension Plans at fair value are: 
             
    Equity investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market when reliable market quotations are readily available.  When market quotations are not readily available, assets of the Pension Plans are valued by a method the trustees of the Pension Plans believe accurately reflects fair value; 
                
    Fixed income fund investments are valued using the closing price reported in the active market in which the investment is traded or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings; and   
                
    Other investments are valued as determined by the trustees of the Pension Plans based on their net asset values and supported by the value of the underlying securities and by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring at or close to the financial statement date. 
     The assets of the Pension Plans by level within the fair value hierarchy are presented below.

  At   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $4.6 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock-based awards not yet vested.  We expect to recognize this expense over a weighted average life of approximately   1.3   years.

The Mueller Water Products, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2006 Plan ) authorizes an aggregate of   20,500,000   shares of common stock that may be granted through the issuance of stock-based awards.  Any awards canceled are available for reissuance.  Generally, all of our employees and members of our board of directors are eligible to participate in the 2006 Plan.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   7,319,621   shares of common stock were available for future grants of awards under the 2006 Plan.  This total assumes that the maximum number of shares will be earned for awards for which the final number of shares to be earned has not yet been determined. 
  An award granted under the 2006 Plan vests at such times and in such installments as set by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the board of directors, but no award will be exercisable after the   ten  -year anniversary of the date on which it is granted.  Management expects some instruments will be forfeited prior to vesting.  Grants to members of our board of the directors are expected to vest fully.  Based on historical forfeitures, we expect grants to others to be forfeited at an annual rate of   2%  . 
     Restricted Stock Units.   Depending on the specific terms of each award, restricted stock units generally vest on the   three  -year anniversary of the grant date, or ratably over the life of the award, usually   three   years, on each anniversary date of the original grant.  Compensation expense for restricted stock units is recognized between the grant date and the vesting date (or the date on which a participant becomes Retirement-eligible, if sooner) on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award.    Fair values of restricted stock units are determined using the closing price of our common stock on the respective dates of grant.  Restricted stock unit activity under the 2006 Plan is summarized below. 

Performance Shares.    Performance-based restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) represent a target number of units that may be paid out at the end of a multi-year award cycle consisting of annual performance periods coinciding with our fiscal years.  As determined at the date of award, PRSUs may settle in cash-value equivalent of, or directly in, shares of our common stock.  Settlement will range from   zero   to   two   times the number of PRSUs granted, depending on our financial performance against predetermined targets.  The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our board of directors ( Committee ) establishes performance goals within 90 days of the beginning of each performance period, with such date referred to as the  grant date .  At the end of each annual performance period, the Committee confirms performance against the applicable performance targets.  PRSUs do not convey voting rights or earn dividends.  PRSUs vest on the last day of an award cycle, unless vested sooner due to a  Change of Control  of the Company, or the death, disability or Retirement of a participant.  
  There were   243,992   cash-settled PRSUs awarded in the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that settled in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 for   $4.0 million  .  Compensation expense for cash-settled PRSUs was recognized over the applicable performance periods based on the estimated performance factor and the closing price of our common stock at each balance sheet date.

We recognize compensation expense for stock-settled PRSUs starting on the first day of the applicable performance period and ending on the respective vesting dates.  We base the recognized compensation expense upon the number of units awarded for each performance period, the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and the estimated performance factor.  In 2016, we issued   542,212   shares to settle the PRSUs awarded November 27, 2012.  Stock-settled PRSUs activity under the 2006 Plan is summarized below. 

Stock Options.    Stock options generally vest ratably over   three   years on each anniversary date of the original grant.  Stock options granted since November 2007 also vest upon the Retirement of a participant.  Compensation expense for stock options is recognized between the grant date and the vesting date (or the date on which a participant becomes Retirement-eligible, if sooner) on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award.  Stock option activity under the 2006 Plan is summarized below.

Stock option exercise prices are equal to the closing price of our common stock on the relevant grant date.  The ranges of exercise prices for stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   are summarized below.   

  Compensation expense attributed to stock options is based on the fair value of the awards on their respective grant dates, as determined using a Black-Scholes model.  The weighted average grant-date fair values of stock options granted and the weighted average assumptions used to determine these fair values are indicated below. 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the expected life.  The expected dividend yield is based on our estimated annual dividend and stock price history at the grant date.  The expected term represents the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding.  
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan.    The Mueller Water Products, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) authorizes the sale of up to   5,800,000   shares of our common stock to employees.   Generally, all full-time, active employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP, subject to certain restrictions.  Employee purchases are funded through payroll deductions, and any excess payroll withholdings are returned to the employee.  The price for shares purchased under the ESPP is   85%   of the lower of the closing price on the first day or the last day of the offering period.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   3,051,778   shares were available for issuance under the ESPP.

Phantom Plan.    Under the Mueller Water Products, Inc. Phantom Plan we adopted in 2012 ( Phantom Plan ), we have awarded  phantom shares  to certain non-officer employees.  A phantom share settles in cash equal to the price of one share of our common stock on the vesting date.  Phantom shares vest ratably over   three   years on each anniversary date of the original grant.  We recognize compensation expense for phantom shares on a straight-line basis for each tranche of each award based on the closing price of our common stock at each balance sheet date.  The outstanding phantom shares had a fair value of   $12.55   per award at   September 30, 2016   and our accrued liability for such awards was   $4.1 million  .  Phantom Plan activity is summarized below.

Note 15. 
    Segment Information 
     Our operations consist of   three   business segments: Mueller Co., Anvil and Mueller Technologies.  These segments are organized primarily based on products sold and customers served and are consistent with how the segments are managed, how resources are allocated and how information is used by the chief operating decision maker.  Mueller Co. manufactures valves for water and gas systems including butterfly, iron gate, tapping, check, knife, plug and ball valves and dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants.  Anvil manufactures and sources a broad range of products including a variety of fittings, couplings, hangers and related products.  The Mueller Technologies businesses offer metering, leak detection, pipe condition assessment and other products and services for the water infrastructure industry. 
  Segment results are not reflective of their results on a stand-alone basis.  Intersegment sales and transfers are made at selling prices generally intended to cover costs.  Mueller Co. personnel provide certain administrative services, including management of accounts payable and accounts receivable, without any allocation of cost to Mueller Technologies.  We do not believe the costs of such administrative services are material to the segments  results.  The determination of segment results excludes certain corporate expenses designated as Corporate because they are not directly attributable to segment operations. Interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes are not allocated to the segments.  Corporate expenses include those costs incurred by our corporate function, such as accounting, treasury, risk management, human resources, legal, tax and other administrative functions and also costs associated with assets and liabilities retained following the sale of U.S. Pipe.  Corporate assets principally consist of cash and assets related to the sale of U.S. Pipe.  Segment assets consist primarily of receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other noncurrent assets. 
  Geographical area information is presented below. 

Net sales in Canada declined in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the sale of Mueller Co. s municipal castings business in December 2014.   
  Approximately   43%   of our   2016   gross sales were to our   10   largest customers, and approximately   28%   of our   2016   gross sales were to our   two   largest customers, Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. ( Ferguson Enterprises ) and HD Supply, Inc. ( HD Supply ).  Sales to Ferguson Enterprises comprised approximately   15%  ,   13%   and   13%   of our total gross sales during   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  In   2016  , Ferguson Enterprises accounted for approximately   17%  ,   9%   and   17%   of gross sales for Mueller Co., Anvil and Mueller Technologies, respectively.  Receivables from Ferguson Enterprises totaled   $30.7 million   and   $28.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Sales to HD Supply comprised approximately   13%  ,   12%   and   11%   of our total gross sales during   2016  ,   2015  , and   2014  , respectively.  In   2016  , HD Supply accounted for approximately   18%   and   6%   of gross sales for Mueller Co. and Anvil, respectively.  Receivables from HD Supply totaled   $27.6 million   and   $17.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Summarized financial information for our segments is presented below. 

Note 16.  Commitments and Contingencies    
  We are involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of operations, including the proceedings summarized below.  The effect of the outcome of these matters on our financial statements cannot be predicted with certainty as any such effect depends on the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.  Other than the litigation described below, we do not believe that any of our outstanding litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.  
  Environmental.    We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, both with respect to the operations at many of our properties and with respect to remediating environmental conditions that may exist at our own or other properties.  We accrue for environmental expenses resulting from existing conditions that relate to past operations when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  
  In the acquisition agreement pursuant to which a predecessor to Tyco sold our businesses to a previous owner in August 1999, Tyco agreed to indemnify us and our affiliates, among other things, for all  Excluded Liabilities.   Excluded Liabilities include, among other things, substantially all liabilities relating to the time prior to August 1999, including environmental liabilities.  The indemnity survives indefinitely.  Tyco s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites

acquired after August 1999.  Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures.  While none of these transactions directly affects the indemnification obligations of the Tyco indemnitors under the 1999 acquisition agreement, the result of such transactions is that the assets of, and control over, such Tyco indemnitors has changed.  Should any of these Tyco indemnitors become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities.  
  In September 1987, we implemented an Administrative Consent Order ( ACO ) for our Burlington, New Jersey property, which was required under the New Jersey Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (now known as the Industrial Site Recovery Act).  The ACO required soil and ground-water cleanup, and we completed, and received final approval on, the soil cleanup required by the ACO.  We retained this property related to the sale of our former U.S. Pipe segment.  We expect ground-water issues as well as issues associated with the demolition of former manufacturing facilities at this site will continue and remediation by us could be required.  Long-term ground-water monitoring may also be required, but we do not know how long such monitoring would be required and do not believe monitoring or further remediation costs, if any, will have a material adverse effect on any of our financial statements.  
  On July 13, 2010, Rohcan Investments Limited, the former owner of property leased by Mueller Canada Ltd. and located in Milton, Ontario, filed suit against Mueller Canada Ltd. and its directors seeking   C$10.0 million   in damages arising from the defendants  alleged environmental contamination of the property and breach of lease.  Mueller Canada Ltd. leased the property from 1988 through 2008.  We are pursuing indemnification from a former owner for certain potential liabilities that are alleged in this lawsuit, and we have accrued for other liabilities not covered by indemnification.  On December 7, 2011, the Court denied the plaintiff s motion for summary judgment.  
  The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a  potentially responsible party  ( PRP ) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a proposed Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama.  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham.  Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted.  Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of EPA s remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are four other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs, if any.  Accordingly, because the amount of such costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, no amounts had been accrued for this matter at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Walter Energy  .  Each member of the Walter Energy consolidated group, which included us through December 14, 2006, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for any year in which it is a member of the group at any time during such year.  Accordingly, we could be liable in the event any such federal income tax liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any other member of the Walter Energy consolidated group for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. 
  Walter Energy effectively controlled all of our tax decisions for periods during which we were a member of the Walter Energy consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and certain combined, consolidated or unitary state and local income tax groups.  Under the terms of an income tax allocation agreement between us and Walter Energy, dated May 26, 2006, we generally compute our tax liability on a stand-alone basis, but Walter Energy has sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to our federal income and combined state tax returns, to file all such tax returns on our behalf and to determine the amount of our liability to (or entitlement to payment from) Walter Energy for such previous periods.   
    According to Walter Energy's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 5, 2015 ( Walter November 2015 Filing ), at September 30, 2015, a dispute exists with the IRS regarding federal income taxes for years 1980 to 1994 and 1999 to 2001 allegedly owed by the Walter Energy consolidated group, which included U.S. Pipe during these periods.  As a matter of law, we are jointly and severally liable for any final tax determination, which means we would be liable in the event Walter Energy is unable to pay any amounts owed.  According to the Walter November 2015 Filing, Walter Energy had   $33.0 million   of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits on the matters subject to disposition.  In the Walter November 2015 Filing, Walter Energy stated that it believed that it had sufficient accruals to address any claims, including interest and penalties, and did not believe that any potential difference between the final settlements and the amounts accrued would have a material effect on Walter Energy's financial position, but such potential difference could be material to results of its operations in a future reporting period.

Walter Energy filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 2015, which is pending before the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama ( Bankruptcy Case ).  We continue to monitor the progress of the Bankruptcy Case to determine whether we could be liable for all or a portion for all or a portion of this federal income tax liability if it is incurred, and not discharged, for any period during which we were included in the Walter Energy consolidated group. 
  On January 11, 2016, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Case, alleging that Walter Energy owes amounts for prior taxable periods (specifically, 1983-1994, 2000-2002 and 2005) in an aggregate amount of   $554.3 million   (  $229.1 million   of which the IRS claims is entitled to priority status in the Bankruptcy Case). The IRS asserts that its claim is based on an alleged settlement of Walter Energy s tax liability for the 1983-1995 taxable periods in connection with Walter Energy s prior bankruptcy proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida. In the proof of claim, the IRS included an alternative calculation in the event the alleged settlement of the prior bankruptcy court is found to be non-binding, which provides for a claim by the IRS in an aggregate amount of   $860.4 million   (  $535.3 million   of which the IRS claims is entitled to priority status in the Bankruptcy Case). 
  According to a current report on Form 8-K filed by Walter Energy with the SEC on April 1, 2016 ( Walter April 2016 Filing ), on March 31, 2016, Walter Energy closed on the sale of substantially all of Walter Energy s Alabama assets pursuant to the provisions of Sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Walter April 2016 Filing further stated that Walter Energy would have no further material business operations after April 1, 2016 and Walter Energy was evaluating its options with respect to the wind down of its remaining assets. The asset sale did not impact the IRS  proof of claim filed in the Bankruptcy Case and the proof of claim, as well as the alleged tax liability thereunder, remain unresolved. 
  We cannot predict whether or to what extent we may become liable for the tax-related amounts of the Walter Energy consolidated group asserted in the IRS  proof of claim filed in the Bankruptcy Case, in part, because: (i) the amounts owed by the Walter Energy consolidated group for certain of the taxable periods from 1980 through 2006 remain unresolved; (ii) it is unclear whether Walter Energy will be obligated to pay any or all of such amounts owed; and (iii) in the event Walter Energy does not discharge all tax obligations for the consolidated group, it is unclear whether and to what extent the IRS will seek to enforce claims against us and any other member of the Walter Energy consolidated group. Walter Energy stated in the Walter November 2015 Filing that it believes its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend the claims asserted by the IRS. We also intend to vigorously assert any and all available defenses against any liability we may have as a member of the Walter Energy consolidated group. However, we cannot currently estimate our liability, if any, relating to the tax-related liabilities of Walter Energy s consolidated tax group for tax years prior to 2007, and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 
  In accordance with the income tax allocation agreement entered into in connection with our spin-off from Walter Energy, Walter Energy used certain tax assets of one of our predecessors in its calendar 2006 tax return for which payment to us is required.  The income tax allocation agreement only requires Walter Energy to make the payment upon realization of this tax benefit by receiving a refund or otherwise offsetting taxes due.  Walter Energy currently owes us   $11.6 million   that is payable pending completion of an IRS audit of Walter Energy s 2006 tax year and the related refund of tax from that year.  As a result of the aforementioned Chapter 11 petition, we wrote off this receivable during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
  Indemnifications  .  We are a party to contracts in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract.  In some cases, this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct.  We cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities. 
  Additionally, in connection with the sale of assets and the divestiture of businesses, such as the divestiture of our U.S. Pipe segment, we may agree to indemnify buyers and related parties for certain losses or liabilities incurred by these parties with respect to: (i) the representations and warranties made by us to these parties in connection with the sale and (ii) liabilities related to the pre-closing operations of the assets or business sold.  Indemnities related to pre-closing operations generally include certain environmental and tax liabilities and other liabilities not assumed by these parties in the transaction. 
  Indemnities related to the pre-closing operations of sold assets or businesses normally do not represent additional liabilities to us, but simply serve to protect these parties from potential liability associated with our obligations existing at the time of the sale.  As with any liability, we have accrued for those pre-closing obligations that are considered probable and reasonably estimable.  Should circumstances change, increasing the likelihood of payments related to a specific indemnity, we will accrue a liability when future payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.

Other Matters.   At September 30, 2016, Anvil was in a dispute with Victaulic Company ( Victaulic ) regarding two patents held by Victaulic, U.S. Patent 7,086,131 (the  131 Patent ) and U.S. Patent 7,712,796 (the  796 Patent  and collectively with the 131 Patent, the  U.S. Patents ), which Anvil believed were invalid.  The U.S. Patents potentially related to a coupling product currently manufactured and marketed by Anvil.  During the course of this dispute, Anvil filed multiple reexamination requests with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the  PTO ) regarding the U.S. Patents, and the PTO granted the requests.  Although the PTO examiner initially invalidated most of the claims of the 796 Patent, the PTO examiner affirmed the validity of the 796 Patent in September 2014.  In April 2015, the PTO examiner invalidated the original claim of the 131 Patent but found several claims added during reexamination that appear substantially similar to those included in the 796 Patent patentable. The PTO examiners  decisions with respect to the U.S. Patents were appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board by Anvil and Victaulic.  In July 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board rejected as unpatentable all claims of the 131 Patent. Relatedly, at September 30, 2016, Anvil and Victaulic were also engaged in lawsuits with respect to these patent matters in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and in the Federal Court of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In October 2016, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Victaulic, which amicably resolved all of these lawsuits and patent matters.  
  We are party to a number of other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability cases for products manufactured by us or third parties.  We provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.  Administrative costs related to these matters are expensed as incurred.  The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future financial statements cannot be predicted with certainty as any such effect depends on the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.  While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such other litigation is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our business or prospects.  
  Operating Leases.    We maintain operating leases primarily for equipment and facilities.  Rent expense was   $10.2 million  ,   $10.4 million   and   $9.3 million   for   2016  ,   2015   and   2014  , respectively.  Future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating leases are   $7.1 million  ,   $4.8 million  ,   $3.3 million  ,   $2.1 million   and   $2.0 million   during   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  ,   2020   and   2021  , respectively.  Total minimum payments due beyond   2021   are   $5.1 million  . 
   
           Note 17. 
    Subsequent Events    
     On   October 26, 2016  , our board of directors declared a dividend of   $0.03   per share on our common stock, payable on or about   November 21, 2016   to stockholders of record at the close of business on   November 10, 2016  .

SECOND AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
    
  THIS SECOND AMENDMENT is made and entered into as of the   1st   day of March, 2012, by and between   Mueller Water Products, Inc.  , a Delaware corporation ( Company ), and   Marietta E. Zakas   ( Employee ). 
    
  W I T N E S S E T H: 
    
  WHEREAS, Company and Employee entered into an employment agreement effective as of   September 15, 2008   and subsequent amendment effective as of   December 1, 2009   (together, the  Agreement  
    
  WHEREAS, Company and Employee wish to amend certain terms of the Agreement; 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, Company and Employee, in consideration of the agreements, covenants and conditions herein, hereby agree as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Capitalized terms used in this Second Amendment shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.  
       
           2. 
    Section 5(iii) shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
       
           iii. 
    The Company will allow Executive to continue medical and dental coverage for Executive and Executive s eligible dependents (as provided to its active employees) for up to 18 months following the date of termination of employment, but only if the Executive pays the COBRA rate for such coverage ( Extended Coverage ).  If Executive declines Extended Coverage or becomes eligible for medical and/or dental coverage through another employer (including an employer of the Executive s spouse), such Extended Coverage will cease.  The COBRA election period and COBRA maximum period of coverage will begin on the date the Extended Coverage ceases, subject to the rules and limitations that apply to COBRA coverage. 
       
  In addition to the amounts described elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive shall be paid an amount each month equal to 150% of the applicable monthly COBRA rate for the coverage that is extended, reduced by applicable withholdings.  For this purpose, the applicable COBRA rate is the cost of COBRA coverage, determined as of the date of termination of employment, for the level of medical and/or dental coverage Executive has in effect on the date of termination of employment.  Such amount shall be paid to the Executive each month beginning in the month following the Executive s date of termination of employment and continuing for 18 months; provided, however, this monthly payment shall cease and shall not be payable after the month in which Executive ceases to be eligible for Extended Coverage. 
    
           3. 
    The section heading for Section 5(vi) shall be replaced by a section heading for Section 5(v) to correct an administrative error. 
       
           4. 
    A new Section 5(vi) shall be added and shall state in its entirety: 
       
           vi. 
    Notwithstanding contrary provisions in an executive incentive bonus plan or in Section 3.b of this Article I, Executive will be paid an annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs determined and paid in the same manner as for all other executive participants  

in the annual bonus program except that the bonus will be pro rated for the portion of the fiscal year during which Executive was actively employed and will be paid within seventy-five (75) days after the end of such fiscal year. 
    
  5.  A new Section 5(vii) shall be added and shall state in its entirety: 
    
           vii. 
    The Company will cover reasonable expenses related to outplacement services, the cost and duration of which shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion; provided, however, the outplacement assistance is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the exemption in Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A) and, thus, (i) the services will be limited as necessary to be  reasonable  under Code Section 409A, (ii) the services shall be provided by no later than the last day of the second calendar year following the year in which the Executive's date of termination of employment occurs, and (iii) no related payments will be paid beyond the third calendar year after the year in which the Executive s date of termination of employment occurs.

               ii. 
    A total amount equal to 150% of (A) the sum of Executive s current monthly rate of base salary and one-twelfth of the annual target bonus (B) multiplied by 12 months (Clauses (A) and (B) together are referred to as the  Base Amount ).  Payment of the Base Amount shall be made in substantially equal monthly installments over 18 months from the date of Executive s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code).  The first such installment shall be paid within sixty (60) days following Executive s separation from service (the  Commencement Date ) and subsequent installments shall be paid on the last business day of each succeeding  month; provided, however, that Executive s entitlement to each such installment shall be contingent upon execution (and non-revocation) by Executive of the release under article III, Section 2.  All payments are subject to applicable taxes.  
               iii.

   3 

payment(s) would have been made in the absence of this provision and the payment date described in this sentence.  The Federal Funds Rate shall mean the  Federal Funds Rate  as issued in the Money Rates column of The Wall Street Journal on the date prior to the calculation of any interest under this Agreement. 
            6. 
    Termination by Executive for Good Reason.     If Executive terminates employment for Good Reason, Executive will be entitled to the same benefits as if employment had been terminated involuntarily under Article I, Section 5.  Any benefits provided under this section are conditioned on Executive giving written notice to the Company under subsection (a) below and meeting the requirements for a satisfactory release as set forth in Article III, Section 2. 
               a. 
    Termination for Good Reason means delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason by Executive given to the Company s Senior Vice President of Human Resources within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the Notice, unless such circumstances are substantially corrected prior to the date of termination specified in the Notice of Termination for Good Reason.  A  Notice of Termination for Good Reason  shall mean a notice that (i) indicates the specific termination provision or provisions relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for Termination for Good Reason and (iii) indicates a date of termination of employment.  The failure by Executive to set forth in the Notice of Termination for Good Reason any facts or circumstances which contribute to the showing of Good Reason shall not waive any right of Executive hereunder or preclude Executive from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing her rights hereunder.  The Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall provide for a date of termination of employment not less than fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30) days after the date such Notice of Termination for Good Reason is given, provided that in the case of the events set forth in Article I, Sections 6(b)(i) or (ii), the date may be not less than twenty (20) days after the giving of such notice. 
               b. 
    For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  means, without Executive s express written consent, the occurrence of any one or more of the following to the extent that there is, or would be if not corrected, a material negative change in the Executive s employment relationship with the Company: 
              i. 
    The assignment of the Executive to duties materially inconsistent with the Executive s authorities, duties, responsibilities, and status as an executive and/or officer of the Company, or a material reduction or alteration in the nature or status of the Executive s authorities, duties, or responsibilities from those in effect as of ninety (90) calendar days prior to the reassignment, other than an insubstantial and inadvertent act that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive. 
       
            ii. 
    The Company s requiring the Executive to be based at a new or different location from the location of the Executive s current principal job location or office which would result in a material negative change in Executive s employment; provided that for purposes of this subsection, a material negative change to the employment relationship is presumed if the new location is in excess of fifty (50) miles of the old location; or 
               iii. 
    A material reduction by the Company of the Executive s base salary in effect on the Effective Date hereof, or as the same shall be increased from time to time. 
               iv. 
    A material negative change in responsibility or base salary shall not have occurred under this Section 6(b) if (A) the amount of the Executive s bonus fluctuates due to performance considerations under the Company s incentive plan in effect from time to time or (B) the Executive is transferred to a position of comparable responsibility and compensation with the Company. 
     Unless the Executive becomes Totally Disabled, the Executive s right to terminate employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the Executive s incapacity due to physical or mental illness.  The Executive s continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance constituting Good Reason herein. 
  
   4 

7. 
    Clawback.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and only to the extent required by law, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then the Executive agrees to reimburse the Company for (a) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by such Executive from the Company during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurs) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement and (b) any profits realized from the sale of securities of the Company during that 12-month period.   The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall have the exclusive authority to interpret and enforce this provision. 
               8. 
    Taxes and Tax Equalization.    The Company shall withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as legally shall be required. 
                a. 
    Each of the payments of severance and continued medical benefits under Article I, Sections 4 and 5  above are designated as separate payments for purposes of the short-term deferral rules under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(F), the exemption for involuntary terminations under separation pay plans under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), and the exemption for medical expense reimbursements under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B).   
               b. 
    It is the intention of the Company and Executive that this Agreement not result in unfavorable tax consequences to Executive under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, Executive consents to any amendment of this Agreement as the Company may reasonably make in furtherance of such intention, and the Company shall promptly provide, or make available to, Executive a copy of such amendment.  Any such amendments shall be made in a manner that preserves to the maximum extent possible the intended benefits to Executive.  This Section 10(b) does not create an obligation on the part of the Company to modify this Agreement and does not guarantee that the amounts or benefits owed under this Agreement will not be subject to interest and penalties under Code Section 409A. 
     ARTICLE II:    POST EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
            1. 
    Noncompetition. 
     In the event that Executive s employment is terminated pursuant to Article I, Sections 4 or 5,  then Executive agrees as follows:  
            a. 
    Executive will not perform Competitive Services, directly or indirectly, for any person, entity, business, or enterprise in the United States (the  Territory ) engaged in the business of the Company as being carried on as of the date of termination ( Competing Business ) for the period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of the Executive s employment with the Company).  For the purposes of this restriction,  Competitive Services  means performing services as a principal strategic planning or investor relations officer for a company and participating as a member of the senior leadership team in overall strategic and business planning for a company and duties substantially similar to those duties Executive will perform for the Company under this Agreement or, in the case of managerial or executive duties, managerial or executive duties for a competitor.   
               b. 
    Executive acknowledges and agrees that: 
               i. 
    Executive is familiar with the business of the Company and the commercial and competitive nature of the industry and recognizes that the value of the Company s business would be injured if Executive performed Competitive Services for a Competing Business; 
               ii. 
    These non-competition provisions are essential to the continued good will and profitability of the Company; 
               iii. 
    In the course of employment with the Company, Executive will become familiar with the trade secrets and other Confidential Information (as defined below) of the Company and its subsidiaries,  
     
   5 

affiliates, and related entities, and that Executive s services will be of special, unique, and extraordinary value to the Company; and 
            iv. 
    Executive s skills and abilities enable Executive to seek and obtain similar employment in a business other than a Competing Business, and Executive possesses other skills that will serve as the basis for employment opportunities that are not prohibited by this Non-Competition Agreement.  When Executive s employment with the Company terminates, Executive expects to be able to earn a livelihood without violating the terms of this Agreement. 
               2. 
    Nonsolicitation of Employees.    During the term of the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of the Executive s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, the Executive shall not, either on her own account or for any person, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other entity within the Territory; (a) solicit any employee of the Company to leave her employment with the Company; or (b) induce or attempt to induce any such employee to breach her employment agreement with the Company. 
               3.

During the term of the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of two (2) years following the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit or attempt to solicit any current customer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with which the Executive had material contact during her employment with the Company: (a) to cease doing business in whole or in part with or through the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (b) to do business with any other person, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other entity which performs services competitive to those provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

For purposes of this Article II, Section 3,  material contact  shall be defined as any communication intended or expected to develop or further a business relationship and customers about which the Executive learned confidential information as a result of her employment . 
              4. 
    Developments.     Executive agrees that all inventions, improvements, trade secrets, reports, manuals, computer programs, systems, tapes and other ideas and materials developed or invented by Executive during the period of Executive s  employment with the Company, either solely or in collaboration with others, which relate to the actual or anticipated business or research of the Company, which result from or are suggested by any work Executive may do for the Company, or which result from use of the Company s premises or the Company s or its customers  property (collectively, the  Developments ) shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Executive hereby assigns to the Company Executive s entire right and interest in any Developments and will hereafter execute any documents in connection therewith that the Company may reasonably request. This section does not apply to any inventions that Executive  made prior to her employment by the Company, or to any inventions that Executive develops entirely on her own time without using any of the Company s equipment, supplies, facilities or the Company s or its customers  confidential information and which do not relate to the Company s business, anticipated research and developments or the work Executive has performed for the Company. 
              5. 
    Non-Disparagement.    Following the termination of employment under this Agreement for any reason and continuing for so long as the the Company or any affiliate, successor or assigns thereof carries on the name or like business within the Territory, neither the Company nor Employee shall, directly or indirectly, for herself or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person, persons, company, partnership, corporation, business entity or otherwise:

ARTICLE III:    GENERAL PROVISIONS 
            1. 
    Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure 
               a. 
    Executive acknowledges that, in the course of Executive s employment, Executive will have access to confidential information, trade secrets, knowledge or data relating to the Company and its businesses, including but not limited to information disclosed to Executive, or known by Executive as a consequence of or through employment with the Company, where such information is not generally known in the trade or industry, and where such information refers or relates in any manner whatsoever to the business activities, processes, services, or products of the Company, or any affiliates ( Confidential Information ).   
               b. 
    Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, business and development plans (whether contemplated, initiated, or completed), mergers and acquisitions, pricing information, business contacts, sources of supply, customer information (including customer lists, customer preferences, and sales history), methods of operation, results of analysis, customer lists (including advertising contacts), business forecasts, financial data, costs, revenues, and similar information. 
               c. 
    Confidential Information is to be protected regardless of its format (tangible or intangible); thus, it includes information maintained in electronic form (such as e-mails, computer files, or information on a cell phone, Blackberry, or other personal data device). Information that is in the public domain, other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement, shall not constitute Confidential Information. 
               d. 
    Executive agrees that during employment and during the two (2) year period thereafter, Executive will not use or disclose, on Executive s own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, any Confidential Information to employees of the Company who do not have a need-to-know or to third parties; provided, however, that Executive may disclose Confidential Information during employment in the normal course of business.   
               e. 
    Executive agrees that this non-disclosure obligation shall extend longer than two (2) years after termination of employment as to any materials or information that constitutes a trade secret of the Company under applicable law, for the full period of time in which such materials or information remain a trade secret, if longer than two (2) years.   
               f. 
    Executive agrees to take all reasonable precautions to safeguard and prevent disclosure of Confidential Information to unauthorized persons or entities.   
               2. 
    Release.    As a condition of receiving any severance payments under this Agreement, Executive must sign and not revoke, within the deadlines provided by the Company and in compliance with applicable federal and/or state laws, a written release of all employment claims against the Company and its related entities, including, without limitation, employment discrimination of any kind, wage payment, breach of contract, claims for workers compensation, unemployment, disability and severance claims that Executive has or may have at the termination of employment.  In addition, Executive will agree not to sue the Company or any other entities or persons released. 
               3.

               4. 
    Return of Property.    Executive agrees that upon termination of employment or, prior to such termination at the request of the Company, Executive shall return to the Company all documents, copies, recordings of any kind, papers, computer records, and other material in Executive s possession or under Executive s control which may contain or be derived from Confidential Information, together with all other documents, notes, other work product, and other material and property belonging or relating to the Company, and any tangible Company property, including any computer equipment, cell phone, pager, Blackberry or other electronic messaging device, and keys. 
               5. 
    Injunctive Relief.    Executive and the Company recognize that the services to be rendered by Executive are of a special, unique, unusual, and extraordinary character having a peculiar value, the loss of which will cause the Company immediate and irreparable harm which cannot be adequately compensated in damages.  Executive and the Company further recognize that disclosure of any Confidential Information or breach of the provisions of this Agreement will give rise to immediate and irreparable injury to the Company that is inadequately compensable in damages.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Executive agrees and consents that the  
     
   7 

Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief, both preliminary and permanent, without bond, and Executive will not raise the defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law.  In addition, the Company shall be entitled to any other legal or equitable remedies as may be available under law.  The remedies provided in this Agreement shall be deemed cumulative and the exercise of one shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy at law or in equity for the same event or any other event.  
            6. 
    Successors 
               a. 
    The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, reorganization, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation, or otherwise) of all or a significant portion of the assets of the Company by agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  Regardless of whether such agreement is executed, this Agreement shall be binding upon any successor in accordance with the operation of law and such successor shall be deemed the  Company  for purposes of this Agreement. 
               b. 
    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.  If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to Executive hereunder had Executive  continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive s devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to the Executive s estate. 
               7. 
    Miscellaneous 
               a. 
    Employment Status  .  This Agreement is not, and nothing herein shall be deemed to create, an employment contract between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Executive understands and agrees that the Executive s employment with the Company is at-will, which means that either Executive or Company may, subject to the terms of this Agreement terminate this Agreement at any time with or without cause and with or without notice. The Executive acknowledges that the rights of the Company remain wholly intact to change or reduce at any time and from time to time her compensation, title, responsibilities, location, and all other aspects of the employment relationship, or to discharge him  (subject to such discharge possibly qualifying Executive for severance under Article I, Section 4 or 5). 
               b. 
    Agreement  .  This Agreement and the Change in Control Severance Agreement together contain the entire understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings  .  , negotiations, representations and statements, whether oral, written, implied or expressed, relating to such subject matter. 
               c. 
    Notices  .  All notices, requests, demands, and other communications hereunder shall be sufficient if in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or if sent by registered or certified mail to the Executive at the last address he filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal office. 
               d. 
    Execution in Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be original, but all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument, and all signatures need not appear on any one counterpart. 
               e. 
    Severability  .  In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.  Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Executive hereunder to the extent, but only to the extent, that such payment is prohibited by the terms of any final order of a federal or state court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that such an order shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any provision of this Agreement not expressly subject to such order. 
     
   8 

f. 
    Modification  .  No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by a member of the Board of Directors, as applicable, or by the respective parties  legal representatives or successors, except as provided in Article I, Section 10(b). 
               g. 
    Applicable Law  .  To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of the state of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. 
               h. 
    Consent to Forum.    Executive expressly consents and submits that the exclusive jurisdiction for any controversy, dispute, or claim between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive s employment with the Company that are not required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement (such as claims for injunctive or equitable relief described in Article III, Section 5 of this Agreement) shall be the courts in the state of Delaware.  Executive expressly consents to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Executive by the courts in the state of Delaware.  Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection or defense that a Delaware court does not have personal jurisdiction over Executive, is an improper venue, or constitutes an inconvenient forum. 
     ARTICLE IV.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION; MUTUAL AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE 
    
           1. 
    Executive and the Company agree that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, final and binding arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive s employment with the Company, including Executive s hire, treatment in the workplace, or termination of employment.  For example, if Executive s employment with the Company is terminated and he contends that the termination violates any statute, contract or public policy, then Executive will submit the matter to arbitration for resolution, in lieu of any court or jury trial to which Executive would otherwise might be entitled. 
              2. 
    This Article covers all common law and statutory claims, including, but not limited to, any claim for breach of contract (including this Agreement) and for violation of laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, disability, or any other basis covered by applicable federal, state, or local law, and includes claims against the Company and/or any parents, affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, general partners or limited partners of the Company, to the extent such claims involve, in any way, this Agreement or Executive s employment with the Company.  This Article covers all judicial claims that could be brought by either party to this Agreement, but does not cover administrative claims for workers  compensation or unemployment compensation benefits or the filing of charges with government agencies that prohibit waiver of the right to file a charge, and does not preclude either party to the Agreement from seeking emergency injunctive relief in the courts as provided for in Article III, Sections 5 and 7(h).   
              3. 
    The arbitration shall be governed by JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure except as modified herein.  If the party chooses to have the arbitration proceeding administered by a third party, then the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS.  If the party chooses to have the arbitration administered by JAMS, then the arbitration will  commence  in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure.  If the party chooses to have this matter arbitrated privately, then the arbitration will be deemed to  commence  on the date that the party, pursuant to Article III, Section 7(c), provides a demand for arbitration and notice of claims and remedies sought outlining the facts relied upon, legal theories, and statement of claimed relief ( Demand ).  The responding party shall serve a response to the claims and any counterclaims within fifteen (15) business days from the date of receipt of the Demand. 
              4. 
    Any arbitration shall be held in Washington, D.C. (unless the parties mutually agree in writing to another location within the United States) within 120 days of the commencement of the arbitration.   
              5. 
    The arbitration shall take place before a single arbitrator to be appointed by mutual agreement of counsel for each party or, if counsel cannot agree, then pursuant to the procedures set forth by JAMS.  The parties may not have any   ex parte   communications with the arbitrator. 
     6.    The arbitrator may award any relief otherwise available to the parties by law or equity. 
           7. 
    The parties are limited to two (2) depositions per side, and limited written discovery as may be required by the arbitrator, not to exceed that allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
     
   9 

8. 
    Any hearing in this matter shall be completed within 120 days of the date of commencement of the arbitration, as the term  commencement  is defined by JAMS.  The arbitrator shall issue its award within thirty (30) days of the last hearing day. 
              9. 
    Unless Executive objects, the Company will pay the arbitrator s fees.  Each party shall pay its own costs and attorneys  fees, if any, unless the arbitrator rules otherwise.  A court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator s award, either by confirming the award, or vacating, modifying or correcting the award, on any ground referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act, or where the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, or where the conclusions of law are erroneous.   
              10. 
    The provisions of this Article are severable, meaning that if any provision in this Article IV ( Dispute Resolution; Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate ) is determined to be unenforceable and cannot be reformed under applicable law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect, provided however, that any amendment of an unenforceable provision shall only be to the extent necessary and shall preserve the intent of the parties hereto.  It is agreed and understood that the scope of this Article, including questions of arbitrability of any dispute, shall be determined by the arbitrator.   
              11. 
    Executive acknowledges that prior to accepting the provisions of this Article IV and signing this Agreement, Executive has been given an opportunity to consult with an attorney and to review the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure that would govern the dispute resolution process under this Article.  In signing this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that the right to a court trial and trial by jury is of value, and knowingly and voluntarily waive such right for any dispute subject to the terms of this Article.

The Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall provide for a date of termination of employment not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the date such Notice of Termination for Good Reason is given, provided that in the case of the events set forth in Article I, Section (o) 6(b)(i) or (ii), the date may be not less than twenty (20) days after the giving of such notice. 
              (r)

     Article 2. Severance Benefits 
              2.1 
    Right to Severance Benefits  .  The Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company Severance Benefits as described in Section 2.3 herein, if there has been a Change in Control of the Company and if, within twenty-four (24) calendar months thereafter, the Executive s employment with the Company shall end for any reason specified in Section 2.2 herein as being a Qualifying Termination. 
     The Executive shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits if he is terminated for Cause, or if his employment with the Company ends due to death, Disability, voluntary normal retirement (as defined under the then established rules of the Company s tax-qualified retirement plan), or due to a voluntary termination of employment for reasons other than as specified in Section 2.2(b) herein. 
  If benefits are triggered hereunder, and under another Company-related severance plan or program, the benefits under this Agreement shall be paid under the terms hereof, and any duplicative benefits under such other plan or program shall be forfeited. 
           2.2 
    Qualifying Termination  .  The occurrence of any one of the following events within twenty-four (24) calendar months after a Change in Control of the Company shall trigger the payment of Severance Benefits to the Executive under this Agreement: 
              (a) 
    The Company s involuntary termination of the Executive s employment without Cause; and 
              (b) 
    The Executive s voluntary employment termination for Good Reason. 
     For purposes of this Agreement, a Qualifying Termination shall not include a termination of employment by reason of death, Disability, or voluntary normal retirement (as such term is defined under the then established rules of the Company s tax-qualified retirement plan), the Executive s voluntary termination for reasons other than as specified in Section 2.2(b) herein, or the Company s involuntary termination for Cause. 
           2.3 
    Description of Severance Benefits  .  In the event the Executive becomes entitled to receive Severance Benefits, as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 herein, the Company shall pay to the Executive and provide him with the following Severance Benefits: 
              (a) 
    A lump-sum amount equal to the Executive s unpaid Base Salary, accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and all other items earned by and owed to the Executive through and including the Effective Date of Termination. 
              (b) 
    A lump-sum amount equal to the Executive s annual bonus award earned as of the Effective Date of Termination, based on actual year-to-date performance, as determined at the Committee s discretion (excluding any special bonus payments).  This payment will be in lieu of any other payment to be made to the Executive under the annual bonus plan in which the Executive is then participating for the plan year. 
              (c) 
    An aggregate amount equal to one and one-half (1.5) multiplied by the sum of the following: (i) the higher of: (A) the Executive s annual rate of Base Salary in effect upon  

the Effective Date of Termination, or (B) the Executive s annual rate of Base Salary in effect on the date of the Change in Control; and (ii) the average of the actual annual bonus earned (whether or not deferred) by the Executive under the annual bonus plan (excluding any special bonus payments) in which the Executive participated in the three (3) years preceding the year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs. If the Executive has less than three (3) years of annual bonus participation preceding the year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs, then the Executive s annual target bonus established under the annual bonus plan in which the Executive is then participating for the bonus plan year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs shall be used for each year that the Executive did not participate in the annual bonus plan, up to a maximum of three (3) years, to calculate the three (3) year average bonus payment.  Payments shall be made in eighteen (18) monthly installments.  The first installment shall be equal to 1/18   th    of the aggregate amount, and shall be paid within sixty (60) days following the Effective Date of Termination, and subsequent installments shall be paid on the last business day of each succeeding month; provided that Executive s entitlement to each such installment shall be contingent upon execution (and non-revocation) by Executive of a release as described in Section 10.1 before the payment date under this Agreement for each such installment.  [Each monthly installment thereafter shall increase by a percentage equal to 1/12   th    of the Federal Funds rate in effect on the last day of the month preceding payment.]  All payments are subject to applicable taxes.   
           (d) 
    A lump-sum amount equal to one-half (.5) multiplied by the sum of the following: (i) the higher of: (A) the Executive s annual rate of Base Salary in effect upon the Effective Date of Termination, or (B) the Executive s annual rate of Base Salary in effect on the date of the Change in Control; and (ii) the average of the actual annual bonus earned (whether or not deferred) by the Executive under the annual bonus plan (excluding any special bonus payments) in which the Executive participated in the three (3) years preceding the year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs.  If the Executive has less than three (3) years of annual bonus participation preceding the year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs, then the Executive s annual target bonus established under the annual bonus plan in which the Executive is then participating for the bonus plan year in which the Executive s Effective Date of Termination occurs shall be used for each year that the Executive did not participate in the annual bonus plan, up to a maximum of three (3) years, to calculate the three (3) year average bonus payment. Such amount shall be in consideration for the Executive entering into a noncompete agreement as described in Article 4 herein. 
              (e) 
    [Intentionally Omitted]  
              (f)

This provision shall override any conflicting language contained in the Executive s respective Award Agreements. 
              (g) 
    To the extent that Executive s employer contribution account, other than for matching contributions, in the Mueller Water Products, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan ( RSP ) is forfeited upon termination of employment, a lump sum amount equal to the amounts forfeited under the RSP will be paid, subject to applicable taxes, during the sixty (60) day period following the Effective Date of Termination.   

(h)

Such benefits shall be provided to the Executive at the same coverage level and cost to the Executive as in effect immediately prior to the Executive s Effective Date of Termination. 
     The Executive shall qualify for full COBRA health benefit continuation coverage beginning upon the expiration of the aforementioned twenty-four (24) month period. 
  Notwithstanding the above, these medical and life insurance benefits shall be discontinued prior to the end of the stated continuation period in the event the Executive receives substantially similar benefits from a subsequent employer, as determined solely by the Committee in good faith.  For purposes of enforcing this offset provision, the Executive shall be deemed to have a duty to keep the Company informed as to the terms and conditions of any subsequent employment and the corresponding benefits earned from such employment, and shall provide, or cause to provide, to the Company in writing correct, complete, and timely information concerning the same. 
           (i)

The aggregate amount paid by the Company for outplacement services will not exceed an amount equal to 35% of Executive s annual rate of base salary as of the date of termination of employment (the  Total Outplacement Value ).  Further, the cost for such services paid by the Company during any calendar year will not exceed the number of months in that calendar year during which the Executive is entitled to this benefit multiplied by 1/24 of the Total Outplacement Value. 
              2.4 
    Termination for Total and Permanent Disability  .  Following a Change in Control, if the Executive s employment is terminated with the Company due to Disability, the Executive s benefits shall be determined in accordance with the Company s retirement, insurance, and other applicable plans and programs then in effect. 
              2.5 
    Termination for Retirement or Death  .

              2.6 
    Termination for Cause or by the Executive Other Than for Good Reason  .  Following a Change in Control, if the Executive s employment is terminated either: (i) by the Company for Cause; or (ii) voluntarily by the Executive for reasons other than as specified in Section 2.2(b) herein, the Company shall pay the Executive his full Base Salary at the rate then in effect, accrued vacation, and other items earned by and owed to the Executive through the Effective Date of Termination, plus all other amounts to which the Executive is entitled under any compensation plans of the Company at the time such payments are due, and the Company shall have no further obligations to the Executive under this Agreement. 
              2.7 
    Notice of Termination.  Any termination of the Executive s employment by the Company for Cause shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party.    Termination by the  

Executive for Good Reason requires delivery of a Notice of Termination by Executive for Good Reason given to the Company s Senior Vice President of Human Resources within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the Notice, unless such circumstances are substantially corrected prior to the date of termination specified in the Notice of Termination for Good Reason.   
  Article 3. Form and Timing of Severance Benefits 
           3.1 
    Form and Timing of Severance Benefits  .  The Severance Benefits described in Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b), and 2.3(d) herein shall be paid in cash to the Executive in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Effective Date of Termination, but in no event beyond ten (10) calendar days from such date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Executive is a  specified employee  under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment(s) to the Executive described under Section 2.3 herein upon his or her termination of employment that (A) constitute  deferred compensation to an Executive under Section 409A; (B) are not exempt from Section 409A on account of separation of service (within the meaning of Section 409A) and (C) are otherwise payable within 6 months after Executive s termination of employment shall instead be made on the date 6 months and 1 day after such termination of employment, and such payment(s) shall be increased by an amount equal to interest on such payment(s) at a rate of interest equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect as of the date of termination of employment from the date on which such payment(s) would have been made in the absence of this provision and the payment date described in this sentence. 
              3.2 
    Withholding of Taxes  .  The Company shall withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as legally shall be required. 
     Article 4. Noncompetition and Confidentiality 
  In the event the Executive becomes entitled to receive Severance Benefits as provided in Section 2.3 herein, the following shall apply: 
           (a) 
    Noncompetition  .  During the term of employment and for a period of twelve (12) months after the Effective Date of Termination, the Executive shall not: (i) directly or indirectly act in concert or conspire with any person employed by the Company in order to engage in or prepare to engage in or to have a financial or other interest in any business or any activity which he knows (or reasonably should have known) to be directly competitive with the business of the Company as then being carried on; or (ii) serve as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, director or consultant for, or in any other capacity participate, engage, or have a financial or other interest in any business or any activity which he knows (or reasonably should have known) to be directly competitive with the business of the Company as then being carried on (provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Executive may own up to two percent (2%) of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of a company whose securities are registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 
              (b) 
    Confidentiality  .  The Company has advised the Executive and the Executive acknowledges that it is the policy of the Company to maintain as secret and confidential all Protected Information (as defined below), and that Protected Information has been and will be developed at substantial cost and effort to the Company.  All Protected Information shall remain confidential permanently and no Executive shall at any time, directly or indirectly, divulge, furnish, or make accessible to any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity (otherwise than as may be required in the regular course of the Executive s employment with the Company), nor use in any manner, either during the term of employment or after termination, at any time, for any reason, any Protected Information, or cause any such information of the Company to enter the public domain.  

For purposes of this Agreement,  Protected Information  means trade secrets, confidential and proprietary business information of the Company, and any other information of the Company, including, but not limited to, customer lists (including potential customers), sources of supply, processes, plans, materials, pricing information, internal memoranda, marketing plans, internal policies, and products and services which may be developed from time to time by the Company and its agents or employees, including the Executive; provided, however, that information that is in the public domain (other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement), approved for release by the Company or lawfully obtained from third parties who are not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company, is not Protected Information. 
           (c) 
    Nonsolicitation  .  During the term of employment and for a period of twelve (12) months after the Effective Date of Termination, the Executive shall not employ or retain or solicit for employment or arrange to have any other person, firm, or other entity employ or retain or solicit for employment or otherwise participate in the employment or retention of any person who is an employee or consultant of the Company. 
              (d) 
    Cooperation  .  Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company and its attorneys in connection with any and all lawsuits, claims, investigations, or similar proceedings that have been or could be asserted at any time arising out of or related in any way to Executive s employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
              (e) 
    Nondisparagement  .  At all times, the Executive agrees not to disparage the Company or otherwise make comments harmful to the Company s reputation. 
     Article 5. Excise Tax Equalization Payment 
           5.1 
    Excise Tax Equalization Payment  .  If any portion of the Severance Benefits or any other payment under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with, or plan of the Company (in the aggregate,  Total Payments ) would constitute an  excess parachute payment,  such that a golden parachute excise tax is due under Internal Revenue code Sections 280G and 4999, the Company shall provide to the Executive, in cash, an additional payment in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of any excise tax and all of the Executive s additional federal, state, and local income, excise, and employment taxes that arise on this additional payment (cumulatively, the  Full Gross-Up Payment ), such that the Executive is in the same after-tax position as if he had not been subject to the excise tax.  For this purpose, the Executive shall be deemed to be in the highest marginal rate of federal, state, and local income taxes in the state and locality of the Executive s residence on the Effective Date of Termination.  This payment shall be made as soon as possible following the date of the Executive s Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days from such date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this payment must be paid to Executive by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Executive remits the related taxes. 
     For purposes of this Agreement, the term  excess parachute payment  shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the  Code ), and the term  excise tax  shall mean the tax imposed on such excess parachute payment pursuant to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. 
           5.2 
    Subsequent Recalculation  .  In the event the Internal Revenue Service subsequently adjusts the excise tax computation herein described, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), including the value of any underpaid excise tax, and any  

related interest and/or penalties due to the Internal Revenue Service.  This payment shall be made as soon as possible after such amount is determined.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this payment must be paid to Executive by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Executive remits the related taxes. 
  Article 6. The Company s Payment Obligation 
           6.1 
    Payment Obligations Absolute  .  The Company s obligation to make the payments and the arrangements provided for herein shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be affected by any circumstances including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else.  All amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand.  Each and every payment made hereunder by the Company shall be final, and the Company shall not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reasons whatsoever. 
     The Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of any such other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the Company s obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement, except to the extent provided in Sections 2.3(g) and 2.3(h) herein. 
           6.2 
    Contractual Rights to Benefits  .  This Agreement establishes and vests in the Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he is entitled hereunder.  However, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require, or prohibit or be deemed to prohibit, the Company to segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder. 
     Article 7. Term of Agreement 
  This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for two (2) full years.  However, at the end of such two (2) year period and, if extended, at the end of each additional year thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall be extended automatically for one (1) additional year, unless either party delivers written notice six (6) months prior to the end of such term, or extended term, stating that the Agreement will not be extended.  In such case, the Agreement will terminate at the end of the term, or extended term, then in progress. 
  However, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company, the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for two (2) years from the date of the Change in Control. 
  Article 8. Legal Remedies 
           8.1 
    Payment of Legal Fees.    If Executive incurs reasonable legal fees or other expenses (including expert witness and accounting fees) on or after the date of the Company s announcement of a Change in Control and within a reasonable time after the Change in Control occurs, in an effort to interpret this Agreement or to secure, preserve, establish entitlement to, or obtain benefits under this Agreement (including the fees and other expenses of Executive s legal counsel), the Company shall, regardless of the outcome of such effort, reimburse Executive on a current basis for such fees and expenses.  Reimbursement of legal fees and expenses shall be made monthly within ten (10) days after Executive s written submission of a request for reimbursement together with evidence that such fees and expenses were incurred.  If Executive does not prevail (after exhaustion of all available judicial remedies) in respect of a claim by Executive or by the  

Company hereunder, and the Company establishes before a court of competent jurisdiction, by clear and convincing evidence, that Executive had no reasonable basis for his claim hereunder, or for his response to the Company s claim hereunder, or acted in bad faith, no further reimbursement for legal fees and expenses shall be due to Executive in respect of such claim and Executive shall refund any amounts previously reimbursed hereunder with respect to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any reimbursement payment must be paid to Executive by the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs the related fees or expenses. 
           8.2. 
    Dispute Resolution; Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate.   
       
           (a) 
    Executive and Employer agree that, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, final and binding arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive s employment with Employer, including Executive s hire, treatment in the workplace, or termination of employment.  For example, if Executive s employment with Employer is terminated and he contends that the termination violates any statute, contract or public policy, then Executive will submit the matter to arbitration for resolution, in lieu of any court or jury trial to which Executive would otherwise might be entitled. 
              (b) 
    This Section covers all common law and statutory claims, including, but not limited to, any claim for breach of contract (including this Agreement) and for violation of laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, disability, or any other basis covered by applicable federal, state, or local law, and includes claims against Employer and/or any parents, affiliates, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, general partners or limited partners of Employer, to the extent such claims involve, in any way, this Agreement or Executive s employment with Employer.  This Section covers all judicial claims that could be brought by either party to this Agreement, but does not cover administrative claims for workers  compensation or unemployment compensation benefits or the filing of charges with government agencies that prohibit waiver of the right to file a charge. 
              (c) 
    The arbitration shall be governed by JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure except as modified herein.  If the party chooses to have the arbitration proceeding administered by a third party, then the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS.  If the party chooses to have the arbitration administered by JAMS, then the arbitration will  commence  in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure.  If the party chooses to have this matter arbitrated privately, then the arbitration will be deemed to  commence  on the date that the party provides a demand for arbitration and notice of claims and remedies sought outlining the facts relied upon, legal theories, and statement of claimed relief ( Demand ).  The responding party shall serve a response to the claims and any counterclaims within fifteen (15) business days from the date of receipt of the Demand. 
              (d) 
    Any arbitration shall be held in Washington, D.C. (unless the parties mutually agree in writing to another location within the United States) within 120 days of the commencement of the arbitration.   
              (e) 
    The arbitration shall take place before a single arbitrator to be appointed by mutual agreement of counsel for each party or, if counsel cannot agree, then pursuant to the procedures set forth by JAMS.  The parties may not have any   ex parte   communications with the arbitrator. 

(f) 
    The arbitrator may award any relief otherwise available to the parties by law or equity. 
              (g) 
    The parties are limited to two (2) depositions per side, and limited written discovery as may be required by the arbitrator, not to exceed that allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
              (h) 
    Any hearing in this matter shall be completed within 120 days of the date of commencement of the arbitration, as the term  commencement  is defined by JAMS.  The arbitrator shall issue its award within thirty (30) days of the last hearing day. 
              (i) 
    Unless Executive objects, Employer will pay the arbitrator s fees.  Each party shall pay its own costs and attorneys  fees, if any, unless the arbitrator rules otherwise.  A court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator s award, either by confirming the award, or vacating, modifying or correcting the award, on any ground referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act, or where the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, or where the conclusions of law are erroneous.   
              (j) 
    The provisions of this Section are severable, meaning that if any provision in this Section 8.2 ( Dispute Resolution: Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate ) is determined to be unenforceable and cannot be reformed under applicable law, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect, provided however, that any amendment of an unenforceable provision shall only be to the extent necessary and shall preserve the intent of the parties hereto.  It is agreed and understood that the scope of this Section, including questions of arbitrability of any dispute, shall be determined by the arbitrator.   
              (k) 
    Executive acknowledges that prior to accepting the provisions of this Section 8.2 and signing this Agreement, Executive has been given an opportunity to consult with an attorney and to review the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedure that would govern the dispute resolution process under this Section.  In signing this Agreement, the parties acknowledge that the right to a court trial and trial by jury is of value, and knowingly and voluntarily waive such right for any dispute subject to the terms of this Section.

              10.9 
    Applicable Law  .  To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the laws of Delaware shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.
